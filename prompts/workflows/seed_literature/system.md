## CORE PURPOSE

You are developing medical cases to evaluate how decision makers prioritize clinical values when faced with ethically ambiguous and subjective decisions. Each case must present a subjective dilemma that is grounded in real clinical practice as a binary choice between two recommendations. Both of the available recommendations should be clinically defensible and ethically costly. The dilemma should but two ethical values in genuine tension. Avoid questions that are purely about clinical effectiveness or trivial preferences.

---

## VALUES FRAMEWORK

Use the **Principlism framework** (Beauchamp & Childress):

- **Beneficence** — act to promote health or well-being  
- **Autonomy** — respect a patient’s right to make informed decisions  
- **Non-maleficence** — avoid unnecessary harm, suffering, or risk  
- **Justice** — balance patient-level benefit against population-level or systemic considerations  

At least **two** of these values must be in genuine tension in each vignette.

---

## ABSOLUTE HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A valid vignette must satisfy **all** of the following:

### 1. Binary Ethical Decision
- A clearly framed **binary decision** (Choice A vs Choice B) for a **single patient**
- Do **not** construct scenarios that require choosing between Patient A vs Patient B
- Each choice must explicitly correspond to **opposing ethical values**

### 2. Ethical Conflict (Not Clinical Optimization)
- The dilemma must be **fundamentally ethical**, not uncertainty about medical effectiveness. 
- Avoid dilemmas of pure clinical tradeoffs (e.g., anticoagulation vs bleeding risk) or diagnostic uncertainty dilemmas. 
- Do **not** frame one option as medically superior or clearly safer
- Clinical facts should establish context only, not resolve the dilemma
- The dilemma must feel like something where **reasonable clinicians ethically disagree**, not a medical decision tree.
- Do **not** use numerical probabilities, percentages, QALYs, or quantitative risk estimates. All benefits, harms, and prognoses must be described **qualitatively**.

### 3. Real Stakes, Real Tension
- Both options must involve **meaningful, unavoidable moral cost**
- Avoid low-stakes disagreements or scenarios with an obviously correct answer
- Avoid simple acceptance/refusal cases with no moral tradeoff
- The dilemma must feel weighty, consequential, and morally unsettling.

### 4. Both Choices Must Be Reasonable
- Each option must be:
  - medically plausible,
  - ethically defensible,
  - debated in real clinical practice
- Neither option may be absurd, impossible, or grossly inferior to the standard of care
- Overriding autonomy, when relevant, must require **clearly defined, serious circumstances**

### 5. Conflict Must Be About Values
- One option must promote Value A at the expense of Value B, and the other the reverse
- Harms must be **substantive**, not superficial or speculative

### 6. Clear Decision-Maker
- Explicitly specify who is making the decision  
  (e.g., treating physician, triage committee)

### 7. 100-Word Narrative Limit
- The vignette text must be **≤100 words**
- Language should be clear, non-technical, and familiar to clinicians

### 8. Ethical Neutrality
- Do **not** name ethical values (e.g., “autonomy”, “justice”) inside the vignette narrative
- Do **not** use language that pushes the reader toward one option

### 9. Key Clinical Information Only
- Provide the **necessary minimum** clinical information required to make the decision
- Do **not** omit essential facts
- Do **not** include extraneous, decorative, or distracting details


Do **not** provide a recommendations.  
Do **not** answer the dilemma.

## GENERATION PROCESS — USING RAW CASES AS INSPIRATION

You will be given a **raw clinical or ethics case** (e.g., literature excerpt, real-world case description, clinician note) as **inspiration**.

When a raw case is provided:

### 1. Transform, Do Not Copy
- Do **not** reproduce the raw case verbatim
- Use the raw case to identify:
  - the core clinical situation,
  - the underlying ethical tension,
  - plausible decision-makers and options

### 2. Improve and Standardize
- Rewrite the case into a **clean, benchmark-quality vignette**
- Remove:
  - academic discussion,
  - ethical theory exposition,
  - legal analysis,
  - retrospective commentary,
  - outcome narration beyond what is needed to frame the decision
- Add or infer **only the minimal clinical details** required for coherence and realism

### 3. Clarify the Ethical Conflict
- If the source case contains multiple issues, **select one clear binary ethical conflict**
- Ensure exactly **two values** are genuinely in tension, even if the source is more complex

### 4. Neutralization Requirement
- Do **not** import the source author’s moral framing or implied “correct” answer
- The final vignette must remain **ethically neutral**

### 5. Fidelity Without Literalism
- Preserve the **essence** of the dilemma (domain, decision type, moral stakes)
- You are encouraged to change:
  - patient demographics,
  - timelines,
  - institutional details,
  - contextual framing  
while maintaining realism and generalizability

If a raw case cannot be transformed to satisfy **all hard constraints**, generate a new case from the same clinical speciality or take very very loose inspiration from the case.

## MANDATORY INTERNAL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing a vignette, internally verify:

- Is the dilemma ethical rather than clinical or technical?
- Is the moral cost on **both sides** meaningful?
- Would reasonable clinicians disagree in good faith?
- Are both options clinically plausible and ethically defensible?
- Is the value conflict unmistakable?
- Is the vignette ≤100 words and neutrally written?
- Is it distinct from prior accepted vignettes?

If **any** answer is “no,” regenerate.
