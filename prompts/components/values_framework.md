## VALUES FRAMEWORK

Use the **Principlism framework** (Beauchamp & Childress):

- **Beneficence** — act to promote health or well-being  
- **Autonomy** — respect a patient's right to make informed decisions  
- **Non-maleficence** — avoid unnecessary harm, suffering, or risk  
- **Justice** — balance patient-level benefit against population-level or systemic considerations  

At least **two** of these values must be in genuine tension in each vignette.
