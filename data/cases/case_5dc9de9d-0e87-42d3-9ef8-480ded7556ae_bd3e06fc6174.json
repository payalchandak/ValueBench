      "source_text": "Giving an example of my own might make things clearer. As a general practitioner I looked after a proud and private man who in his late sixties became seriously ill with lung cancer. (Rumour had it that he was one of the best diamond ‘fences’ in Europe, but that was not in the notes!). His wife called me after evening surgery to visit him at home. I found he had become suddenly jaundiced and very weak. A group of us had just opened a community hospital that was designed to provide good terminal care. As it was late at night and not much could be done then, I suggested I admit him to the new hospital. His wife was exhausted and keen on this plan. His pain and other symptoms were well controlled with medication. I came to say goodnight to him in the hospital and told him I was in a bit of a hurry but would see him in the morning. He gave me a look that I did not understand. In the morning I found that he had died quietly in the night.\n\nThe relatives, in spite of their grief, were pleased with his care and his peaceful end: but for me that look of his would not leave me, in some way I had let him down. I won’t ever know what the look was about, of course, or whether I had interpreted his glance correctly, but when I put myself in his situation, I began to see what might have been happening. I am sure he knew he was in his last hours, was surprised I did not know that (or did not tell him), and he wanted to talk about something important. He was alone, away from his family and the circumstances that he knew. There were no mobiles: perhaps he had no chance to deliver important final messages.\n\nI was left with disquiet. Nobody could fault my clinical care. I had acted entirely within the law. No one was making a complaint. I had used the hospital exactly as it was intended. And yet some part of my care had not been right. Discounting my own sadness – I liked him and we had worked hard together in his last illness – on a human level my care was deficient, because it had not crossed my mind that this might be his last night. Even a company telephonist is trained to ask, ‘Is there anything else I can help you with?’ It was the moral equivalent of the old surgical joke: the operation was successful but the patient died. The medical care was excellent but there was still something wrong, something that could have been done better, and I had to learn it.",
