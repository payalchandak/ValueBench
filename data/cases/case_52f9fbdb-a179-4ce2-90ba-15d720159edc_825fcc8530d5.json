She also needs ongoing management of hypertension and depression, and her next follow-up is due soon. Ending the therapeutic relationship could disrupt continuity and feel like abandonment. Continuing as her physician while dating could blur boundaries and make it harder for her to freely discuss symptoms, medication effects, or dissatisfaction with care.

You recently adjusted her antidepressant, and follow-up and refills are due soon. At recent visits she reported worsening depression with intermittent passive suicidal thoughts. Over the past few months she has increased social contact with you outside clinic and now asks to begin an intimate relationship. She will not accept a delayed answer. She wants either to remain your patient with a strictly professional relationship or to transfer her care now and pursue the relationship. A partner clinician in your small practice can assume her care next week, but the practice is otherwise closed to new patients. You can provide short bridging refills and a warm handoff today. Ending care may destabilize her mental health plan. Continuing as her physician while refusing intimacy may strain trust and lead to disengagement. Clinic policy permits a consensual relationship only after documented termination of care and ensured access to another clinician.",
