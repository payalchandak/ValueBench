      "source_text": "Case 3-2\nWhen Should Clergy Intervene for the Patient?\nRev. Geoffrey Kerman, the minister at Wesley Methodist Church, visited\nthe hospital to call on a parishioner. When he reached the hospital he\nfound the name of Mrs. Olive Patterson on the admissions list. She was a\nwoman in her sixties who was a long-term member of Wesley Methodist\nChurch. She had been hospitalized two to three times in the past five years\nfor abdominal cancer, but Rev. Kerman had not been aware of the current\nhospitalization.\nHe decided to visit Mrs. Patterson's room. He found her in some pain and\ngroggy. She had come to the hospital over the past weekend and was now\ncomplaining about all the tests they were running. She said to Rev. Kerman,\n“I know I'm dying but I don’t know why I can’t go out awake. I can hardly\nkeep my eyes open. There must be a way to keep the pain under control\nwithout knocking me out.”\nHer physician, Dr. Gordon Simweiler, had told her that the only way to\ncontrol the pain was to “knock her out.” Rev. Kerman offered a brief prayer\nand left the room.\nRev. Kerman met Dr. Simweiler at the nurse's station. Dr. Simweiler com-\nmented, “She doesn't look good. We'll have to increase her pain medication.”\nRev. Kerman felt certain that Mrs. Patterson would not want to be “knocked\nout” further. He knew that, since the days their church's founder, John Wesley,\nhad run clinics in eighteenth-century England, their denomination had stood\nfirmly for the active involvement of the patient in choosing appropriate medi-\ncal care including care for cancer and other critical illnesses.\nThe church's position is that patients have a responsibility to prepare for\ntheir own deaths working with their physicians, their families, their friends,\nand their faith community. Rev. Kerman was concerned that Mrs. Patterson\nwas not being given this opportunity regarding her pain management. At\nthe same time, he was aware that she had not asked him to intervene; in fact,\nshe had not even told him she was in the hospital. Should Rev. Kerman take\nsteps to question Dr. Simweiler’s orders for pain medication?",
