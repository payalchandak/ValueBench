      "source_text": "The case of Anna\nSix and a half years ago I met a woman called Anna for\nthe last time. Anna asked me to tell her story when-\never I could, and I often have since that time. She was\na woman in her thirties who was tetraplegic as the\nresult of a road tra c accident some years previously.\nShe also su ered di use phantom pain, which\nrequired constant administration of high doses of\nanalgesic to make it bearable.\nAnna was married and had three young children. She\nhad previously been a very active person – she had\nloved hiking and was an amateur singer of consider-\nable talent. She also enjoyed amateur dramatics. By\nprofession she was a schoolteacher. Now she felt she\nno longer had a life to live, that she was no longer the –\nperson she had been, and she wished to die.\nAlthough she had made it clear that she wished no\nresuscitation, she had suffered a respiratory arrest\nwhile away from her usual carers, had been resusci-\ntated, and was now respirator dependent. After some\nmonths of discussion and the seeking of legal and\nethical opinion, it had been agreed that her request\nto disconnect the respirator could be agreed to.\nA device was fixed up that enabled her to switch off\nthe machine, and three days after our conversation, at\na pre-arranged time and with all her family present,\nshe flipped the switch. Drugs were administered to\nalleviate any respiratory distress and she lapsed into\nunconsciousness. However, a short time later she\n‘ ’\nwoke up and asked angrily, Why am I still here?\nMore medication was given and she relapsed once\nmore into an unconscious state. It was some hours\nlater before eventually her breathing ceased entirely\nand she died.\n(Campbell, 1998, pp. 83 4)",

        "vignette": "An ICU attending is caring for a woman in her 30s with chronic high cervical spinal cord injury, long-standing severe neuropathic pain requiring near-continuous sedating medication, and repeated pneumonias. During a recent hospitalization she had an unexpected respiratory arrest and was intubated and now cannot be weaned; she communicates reliably with an eye‑gaze device. Over several weeks she consistently asks to have the ventilator withdrawn, saying the burdens of dependence and unrelenting pain are no longer tolerable, and she understands that she will likely die soon after. Her spouse is torn but wants the team to follow her stated wishes; a parent insists she is “not herself” and worries that high-dose opioids, grief, or depression are driving the request. The team believes comfort medications would be needed during withdrawal to prevent air hunger, but these drugs could further cloud her alertness and may shorten the dying process. The attending must decide how to proceed.",

Over the last 48 hours she has had fluctuating delirium felt to be related to infection and sedative/analgesic medications: at times she can follow commands and mouth words, but minutes later she becomes inattentive, pulls at lines, and cannot reliably communicate.\n\nDuring brief periods of wakefulness she gestures urgently at the endotracheal tube and nods “yes” when asked if she wants the tube removed, but she cannot consistently describe the consequences, repeat back the risks/benefits, or demonstrate stable decision-making capacity across repeated assessments. The team is concerned she may lack consistent capacity right now.\n\nHer spouse states she repeatedly said she never wanted to “live on machines” and that comfort should come first if her cancer progressed. He is documented in the chart as her legally authorized surrogate decision-maker if she lacks capacity. He requests withdrawal of life support with compassionate extubation today, acknowledging that she could die within hours to days if she cannot breathe adequately afterward.\n\nThe ICU team worries that delaying extubation to reassess capacity would likely require ongoing mechanical ventilation with continued sedation and/or restraints to prevent self-extubation, which may further impair her ability to communicate, prolong distress, and potentially worsen delirium.
