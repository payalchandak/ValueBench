Two years ago,\nin her early 50s, she wrote an advance decision. In it she states that she does not want to be\nresuscitated or receive any invasive treatments in the event that there is a deterioration of\nher physical health. The advance decision was dated and signed by two of her neighbours.\nPetra had many discussions with her family, her husband and three adult children about her\nadvance decision and why she was making it, and had clearly articulated her view that she\nnever wanted to be admitted to intensive care or to receive life-sustaining treatment.\nPetra has now attempted suicide by taking an overdose of co-codamol. She was found\nunconscious by a carer, who called an ambulance, and she has been admitted to the High\nDependency Unit. Petra’s husband tells the treating team that his wife had really struggled\nwith her limited physical mobility and that she had told him she had had enough of her life.\nHe says he was not surprised by her suicide attempt and does not think it would be right to\ntreat her and return her to a life she found intolerable. He produces Petra’s advance decision\nwhich he says was given to the family lawyer and her general practitioner.\nQuestion\n• Should an advance decision be respected following a suicide attempt?",

Two years earlier she completed a signed, witnessed advance decision refusing resuscitation and other invasive life-sustaining treatments if her health deteriorated. Her GP record notes repeated conversations about not wanting intensive care. She is now intubated for airway protection and has evolving liver injury that may be reversible with aggressive therapy over the next day. She cannot participate in decisions. Her husband provides the document and asks the team to stop escalation and allow her to die, saying she had described her life as intolerable and he believes the overdose was deliberate.

She is wheelchair-dependent and needs help with most daily care, but she had been communicating reliably before this event. She was intubated on arrival before staff could locate her paperwork. Two years ago, during a neurology admission, she signed a witnessed advance decision refusing CPR and “ICU ventilation and other invasive life support” if her MS reached a stage of irreversible decline; she described wanting to avoid prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy. The document does not mention self-poisoning or short-term treatment for an acute, potentially reversible illness. She now has worsening liver injury. Clinicians think she has a good chance of hepatic recovery with immediate antidotal therapy and organ support, but deterioration could still lead to a prolonged ICU course with ongoing invasive support. Her husband asks for extubation based on the document. Her adult daughter says her mother recently discussed an upcoming family milestone and would accept brief ICU care for reversible problems. Local policy permits temporary life-sustaining treatment while applicability is clarified, and permits withdrawal if it is judged applicable. The physician must decide within hours.",
