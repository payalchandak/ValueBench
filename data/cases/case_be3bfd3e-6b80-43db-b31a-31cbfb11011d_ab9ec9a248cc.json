She has been rushed to the Accident\nand Emergency department and doctors tell her that she needs urgent treatment; o therwise\nshe is at risk of permanent liver damage or death. Patricia refuses, she says her life is awful\nand she does not want to live anyway. She has been diagnosed with emotional intensity\ndisorder and has had a recent brief admission under the Mental Health Act, although she was\ndischarged last week.\nJohn is 16 and has been involved in a road traffic accident. He needs urgent treatment, which\nwould include blood products. He tells the doctors that he is a practising Jehovah’s Witness\nand in all circumstances he refuses blood products in any form.\nJoshua is 15. Over the past 3 years he has been in and out of hospital for treatment of\nleukaemia. Unfortunately, following a check-up, the doctors tell him that he now needs fur-\nther aggressive chemotherapy. Without treatment his prognosis is poor, and he is likely to\ndie within 6 months. Joshua has had enough. He does not want to go into hospital again\nnor receive any more treatment, which he knows through experience makes him feel very\nsick. He wants to be at home with his family and have a peaceful end to his life. The doctors\nconsider that with this treatment he will have a 30% chance of remission in 5 years.\nQuestions\n• Can a minor refuse medical treatment?\n• Does it make a difference if they are 15 or 17 years old?",
