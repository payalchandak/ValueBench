        "vignette": "A 47-year-old man with end-stage kidney disease receives in-center hemodialysis three times weekly. Over the past month he has worsening pruritus, nausea, and fatigue that could improve with adequate dialysis and medication adjustment. Today he tells you he wants to stop dialysis. He says he is done, but he also asks if anything could make him feel well enough to reconsider. Staff report he was intermittently confused this morning after taking a new sedating medication, though he is now calm and answers questions appropriately. He can describe that stopping dialysis would likely shorten his life and he could die within days with worsening dyspnea and uremic delirium, possibly before hospice can be arranged and before a transplant evaluation scheduled next week. His explanations drift and he has difficulty sustaining attention. His partner requests that you continue dialysis. The next run starts this afternoon, and the unit needs an order within the hour. He has had recent intradialytic hypotension and finds sessions very distressing. Hospital policy and state law support either stopping now or a short, time-limited continuation while capacity and symptoms are urgently reassessed.",
