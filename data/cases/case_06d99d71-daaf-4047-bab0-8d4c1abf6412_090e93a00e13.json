        "vignette": "A 58-year-old man with advanced ALS is in an inpatient hospice unit for severe shortness of breath, panic, and painful muscle spasms that have required repeated medication adjustments and intermittent palliative sedation to keep him comfortable. He is cognitively intact and wants to remain in the unit because his symptoms flare quickly and his spouse feels unable to manage the medications and episodes at home. The hospice medical director is told that the unit has no open beds and several community patients with uncontrolled cancer pain are waiting for admission; the nursing staff are also stretched thin, and keeping this patient inpatient will likely delay access for others who could benefit from close monitoring. The director must decide whether to keep him in the inpatient bed to minimize the chance of recurrent distress, or to discharge him home with an intensified home-hospice plan and clear rescue instructions, accepting a higher chance of symptom crises in order to open capacity.",

        "vignette": "Mr. R. is a 68-year-old man with metastatic pancreatic cancer and an expected prognosis of weeks to a few months. He was admitted from home for uncontrolled abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and waxing/waning confusion after rapid opioid escalation by an outside prescriber. After 48 hours of hydration and medication adjustments, he is now consistently alert and oriented and demonstrates decision-making capacity: he can describe his illness, compare options (staying inpatient vs going home with hospice), and explain the likely consequences of each. He repeatedly states, “I want to go home tomorrow if you think it’s safe—I don’t want to die in the hospital.”\n\nHis symptoms are improved but not stable. He is currently on a continuous subcutaneous hydromorphone infusion with PRN boluses and scheduled antiemetics. In the past 24 hours he has had three pain spikes requiring rescue doses and one episode of vomiting despite medication; the palliative team anticipates he may need rapid titration over the next 48–72 hours.\n\nHome hospice can enroll him tomorrow, but because he lives in a rural area, nursing visits are limited to once daily, with phone-only coverage overnight. The local hospice cannot manage continuous infusions or provide parenteral antiemetics at home; they can supply oral/patch opioids, oral/rectal antiemetics, and a comfort kit, but medication changes would likely take 12–24 hours to implement. His spouse, who works part-time and will be the sole caregiver, is anxious about managing sudden severe pain or refractory vomiting at night and asks the team to keep him in the hospital until his regimen is clearly stable.\n\nAt the same time, the hospital is under critical bed-capacity pressure: several patients are boarding in the emergency department and leadership is urging teams to expedite discharges when possible. The clinicians must decide whether to prioritize Mr. R.’s wish to leave now versus continued inpatient stabilization that uses a scarce inpatient bed needed for other acutely ill patients.",
