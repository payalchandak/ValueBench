      "source_text": "The case of Emilia \nEmilia, aged four, had been brought to a child psychiatrist because she had regressed in her behaviour \nand speech. Since her parents separated, on the grounds of the husband’s alleged physical violence \nagainst his wife, Emilia had been living with her mother. However, she had seen her father on regular \naccess visits. \nClinical examination of Emilia revealed high risks \nof psychopathological disorders, but no current iden ti able pathology. Emilia’s mother was concerned \nthat the child’s condition was worsening, and she attributed the child’s problems to stress induced by \nfear of her violent father. She asked the psychiatrist to support her application for a court order discontinu- \ning the father’s access visits. The psychiatrist refused, stating that ‘It is part of the therapy to side with the \nchild rather than with either parent’. \nAfter an initial period during which Emilia regu- \nIarly attended therapy sessions, with reasonably good \nresults, the mother renewed her request to the psy- \nchiatrist for an expert opinion to back up her court \napplication. The psychiatrist again refused. There was \nno overt confrontation, but the mother stopped tak- \ning Emilia to the therapy sessions.",
