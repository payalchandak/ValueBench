You will honor their wishes.\nb. You agree with their wishes and you ask them to give you the necessary written\nrequest.\nc. You ask them to involve the ethics committee for the hospital.\nd.

        "vignette": "An 84-year-old woman is hospitalized for progressive weight loss and functional decline. She is alert, oriented, and understands why she is in the hospital. CT imaging shows diffuse metastatic lesions. A biopsy report is due this afternoon. It will determine the cancer type and whether any disease-directed options are realistic. The result will guide today’s care planning and whether to proceed with a sedated procedure scheduled later today. Earlier today, when asked how much she wants to know, she said she does not want the biopsy results discussed with her today unless she asks. She asked that her two children be told first and she signed a written authorization allowing both children to receive her medical information. The children now ask that you give them the result first and not discuss it with their mother unless she asks directly. They report she becomes panicked with serious news and may refuse nutrition, therapy, or symptom medications. After sedation, she may be too somnolent to revisit the conversation until tomorrow. Risk management agrees that, given her documented authorization and statement, either approach is permissible if you do not mislead her if she asks.",
