Work through the\nscenario and associated questions, which will\ntake you about 40 minutes, and then return to\nthe text.\nWe have begun with a case taken from a real-life\ninstance, aimed at illustrating the difficulties patients\nmay encounter when deciding whether to give their\ninformed consent to participate in a research trial.\nThis scenario concerns Jan, whose attention is caught\nby a newspaper advertisement requesting people\nwilling to participate in a drug trial for a syndrome\n‘ ’\ncalled generalized anxiety disorder. It is based on an\nactual case from Finland, which seems particularly\nappropriate as the birthplace of the Helsinki\nDeclaration.\nThis scenario concentrates on ve key issues regar-\nfi\nding the patient’s perspective on medical research:\n* Informed consent and criteria for determining\nresearch subjects’ understanding of the risks and\npurposes of the trial;\n* Placebo use in randomized clinical trials, the gold\nstandard of evidence-based medicine;\n* Risk and adverse consequences of both\nparticipation and non-participation in clinical\ntrials;\n* The medicalization of ordinary life, epitomized\nin this scenario by the dubious syndrome being\nstudied in the trial, ‘generalized anxiety\ndisorder’;\n* The doctor–patient relationship in medical\nresearch and how it may conflict with that\nrelationship in the clinical setting. In clinical\nmedicine the patient’s best interest is the doctor’s\npriority, but the research subject is not actually a\npatient and may derive no therapeutic bene t\nfi\nfrom the trial. Indeed, in Phase I trials, where\nthe objective is to study potential side e ects\nff\nof the treatment, the participant runs the\nfi\nrisk of harm rather than bene t. Those subjects\nfi\nassigned to the placebo arm of a clinical trial\nfi\nwill receive no clinical bene ts except\n–\n’\npossibly psychosomatic ones another issue in\nJan s case.",
