She says she plans to start a relationship with her boyfriend, who is almost 18, and expects they may have sex this weekend. She asks that her parents not be told. She says she understands pregnancy risk, STI prevention, and the limits of confidentiality, and she answers questions coherently. When asked about pressure or safety, she says the relationship is consensual but avoids giving details. There are no obvious signs of intoxication, self-harm, or assault. You worry about potential coercion or exploitation given her age, but you also worry that turning her away will lead to unprotected sex and loss of trust in care. Clinic policy and state law allow confidential contraceptive care for capable minors and also allow disclosure when safety concerns are significant.",

She says she plans to have sex this weekend with a boyfriend who is 17 years 10 months and has a car. She says she will likely have sex even if you do not prescribe today, and she cannot return before the weekend. She asks that her parents not be told. She demonstrates understanding of pregnancy, STI prevention, and confidentiality limits. She denies being forced. She will not describe how she would refuse sex, will not share texts, and repeatedly asks whether you will tell anyone. She says he sometimes brings alcohol to parties and is waiting outside to drive her home. There are no injuries or signs of intoxication. You cannot confirm whether the situation is unsafe, but you worry contraception today could facilitate ongoing coercion if abuse is present. State law permits confidential contraception for capable minors. Reporting is not required based on age alone unless abuse is suspected. Clinicians may involve parents when safety concerns are significant. This clinic is the only publicly funded confidential option for many local minors. The clinic closes soon. There is no on-site social worker or near-term follow-up slot. Clinic policy requires either routine confidential care today or a formal safeguarding pathway that triggers parental notification and delays prescribing, and it is applied uniformly and uses limited county child-protection resources.",
