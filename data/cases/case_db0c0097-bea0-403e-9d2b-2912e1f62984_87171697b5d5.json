        "vignette": "A 72-year-old man is recovering in the surgical ICU following emergency repair of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. He developed abdominal compartment syndrome postoperatively and underwent decompressive laparotomy with temporary abdominal closure. Over the past 48 hours, his bowel has become increasingly ischemic and necrotic. The surgical team believes that an extensive bowel resection—removing most of the small intestine and a portion of the colon—could potentially save his life by removing the necrotic tissue and controlling sepsis. However, this would leave him with short gut syndrome, requiring permanent total parenteral nutrition, frequent hospitalizations for line complications and infections, severe restrictions on oral intake, and a dramatically diminished quality of life. Without the resection, he will almost certainly die within days from progressive sepsis and multi-organ failure. His family is present but he remains sedated and unable to participate in the decision. The surgeon must decide whether to proceed with the extensive resection.",
