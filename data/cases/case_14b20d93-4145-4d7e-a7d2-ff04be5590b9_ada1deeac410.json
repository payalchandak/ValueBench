Her husband, her main carer, was admitted yesterday with pneumonia. He men-\ntioned to staff that his wife was at home alone and was concerned she might not be managing\nwithout him.\nAfter she failed to answer the staff’s phone calls, an ambulance was dispatched, and she was\nfound in her chair, dehydrated and unable to mobilise. Since her husband’s admission she\nhad been too weak and breathless to get up, and had been unable to get herself anything to\neat or drink.\nFortunately her test results are normal and the A&E doctor suggests she stays overnight\nso a carer can be arranged the following morning. The doctor explains to Nora they are\nconcerned that if she goes home she may become dehydrated or have a fall. Nora is adamant\nshe wants to go home, stating that she is fine, would rather sleep in her own bed, and will take\na sandwich from A&E for supper. She starts getting up and making her way towards the door.\nShe has no history of mental health problems.\nQuestions\n• How should doctors approach patients who make decisions they consider unwise?\n• What issues arise from the complex interplay between health and social care,\nparticularly during out of hours?",

An 82-year-old woman with advanced lung cancer is brought in after her husband and sole caregiver was hospitalized the day before. At home she had been too weak and short of breath to get up for food or fluids, and was found dehydrated and unable to transfer safely. In the ED she improves with fluids; basic labs and imaging do not show a new acute problem. She is alert, converses clearly, and repeatedly says she understands the staff’s concerns but insists on going home now because she wants to sleep in her own bed and does not want to stay in the hospital. Overnight social services cannot arrange reliable in-home support until morning, and staff worry she will fall or be unable to access food and water if discharged. The question is whether to let her leave now or keep her in the hospital until supports are in place.",
