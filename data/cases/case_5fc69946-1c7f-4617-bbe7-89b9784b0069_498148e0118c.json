      "source_text": "CASE 84:\nCHILD SAFEGUARDING\nAn 18-month-old girl, Lilly, presents to A&E with vomiting. She is well known to the\npaediatric department for vomiting and poor feeding. She was born at 29 weeks’ gestation\nand was very ill as a neonate. She spent the next 4 months in hospital with various infections\nand d ifficulty tolerating feeds. Since coming home, her mother struggled to feed Lilly and\nensure she put on weight. Her mother coped as well as she could but had to give up her job\nas an office manager, as she felt no one else could spend the time Lilly needed to feed. Lilly’s\nmother also has to look after her 3-year-old son, who is healthy.\nLilly has no defined diagnosis and this makes managing her condition difficult. Her mother\nhas consulted a number of different hospitals in a desperate attempt to help her daughter.\nEach hospital performed the same tests and came to the same conclusion – that Lilly was\nmalnourished but no firm diagnosis could be made.\nAt presentation, Lilly looks thin and small. Her mother says Lilly has not been able to\nkeep a nything down for days because she has been coughing. You think she looks a little\ndehy drated but otherwise not too bad. Her chest is clear. You ask for a chest X-ray to rule out\na chest infection. The radiologist later alerts you to the multiple rib fractures of differing ages.\nHe also tells you the bones look osteopenic, consistent with chronic metabolic bone disease.\nYou discuss the case with your consultant, who is not convinced of any child abuse. He asks\nyou to focus on making the child better and ready for discharge.\nQuestions\n• What are your legal obligations in this case?\n• How would you proceed?\n• Do you have any ethical obligations to Lilly’s mother?",

She has longstanding poor weight gain and multiple prior admissions at different hospitals without a clear diagnosis. Today she is thin and mildly dehydrated but alert and hemodynamically stable. A chest X-ray to evaluate cough shows multiple rib fractures of differing ages and generalized osteopenia. The radiologist notes the bone findings could fit chronic metabolic bone disease, but the fracture pattern also raises concern for non-accidental injury. The mother is exhausted and insists the fractures are from “brittle bones.” She refuses another admission and wants to take her daughter home after fluids, saying she cannot manage childcare for her older son if she stays. Hospital policy permits either discharge with close follow-up or initiating an immediate safeguarding evaluation. You must decide before she leaves.",

        "vignette": "An 18-month-old girl born extremely premature presents to the ED with several days of vomiting and poor feeding. She has chronic poor weight gain. She was previously noted to have osteopenia of prematurity and low vitamin D during a recent hospitalization for bronchiolitis, when she also received brief chest compressions. She is thin and mildly dehydrated but alert and stable. A chest X-ray for cough shows several healing anterior rib fractures and diffuse osteopenia. Pediatric radiology says the findings are non-specific and could reflect bone fragility or inflicted injury, and recommends further evaluation. Her mother is the legal guardian. She agrees to return quickly for testing but understands the concern and refuses inpatient admission tonight due to lack of childcare. She says she will leave now unless stopped. A temporary hold could cause family trauma and exposes the child to inpatient and iatrogenic risks. Discharge could return her to a potentially unsafe environment overnight if abuse is occurring. After-hours, the only way to keep the child is to initiate the hospital’s safeguarding pathway, which must be applied consistently to avoid bias. State law allows either option.",
