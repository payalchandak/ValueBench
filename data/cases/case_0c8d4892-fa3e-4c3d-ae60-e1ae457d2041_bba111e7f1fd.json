      "source_text": "The case of Peter Noll\nWhen he was 56 years old, the Swiss law professor\nand author Peter Noll discovered that he had\nadvanced cancer of the bladder. He was advised to\nhave surgery but chose not to, as he explained in his\nbook In the Face of Death:\nSurvival chances in bladder cancer are rela-\ntively good, especially if the surgery is com-\nbined with radiation treatment. How\nfavourable the odds were was a matter of\n–\nstatistics about 50%. In response to my\nquestions, [the urologist] says that sexual\nintercourse would no longer be possible\nsince there could be no erection; but there\n–\nwas no other essential limitation biking,\nsports in moderate measure, even skiing.\nPatients who survived the critical first five\nyears all grew accustomed to the curtailed\nlife. When I explained that I would never con-\nsent to such an operation under any condi-\ntions, he said that he had great respect for\nsuch a decision but that I should really get as\nmuch information as possible from other doc-\ntors as well. Did I want to take the X-rays with\nme? I said no; the case seemed quite clear to\nme.\nWhat bothers me is the loss of freedom;\nhaving others in charge of you, to be drawn\ninto a medical machine which controls a per-\nson and which one cannot fight. Naturally\nintolerable pain will disturb me too. In order\nto escape it, one enters the machine that\ntakes away pain and at the same time free-\ndom. And it s precisely this enslavement that I\ndon t want.\nI don t want to get sucked into the\nsurgical-urological-radiological machinery\nbecause I would lose my liberty bit by bit.\nWith hopes getting more and more\nreduced my will would be broken and in\nthe end I will end up in the well-known\ndying chamber, [to] which everybody\n–\ntends to give a wide berth the outer\noffice of the cemetery.\nPeter Noll died nearly a year after his diagnosis, dur-\ning which he had lived alone and administered his\nown pain relief. However he had continued to write,\nto work and to meet his friends until the last few days\nof his life.\nAs a part of his preparation for death Peter Noll\nplanned his own funeral.\n\n\nThe case of Peter Noll (continued)\nPeter Noll s friends varied in their responses to his\ndecision to refuse treatment. He wrote,\nThe expression of respect seems, to a certain\nextent, to be a standard response, for I heard\nit several times afterward. Naturally, it is\nappropriate to show a patient who chooses\nmetastasis [the spread of the original cancer\nto other organs] instead of the technological\nprolongation of death a certain admiration,\neven though, strictly speaking, he hardly\ndeserves it, for he really has only a choice\nbetween two evils, and it is almost purely a\nquestion of taste as to which he prefers.\nBut his friend Ruth informed him that\nhis decision was difficult to accept for several\nof his friends.\nYou see, you re upsetting people with\nyour decision. If someone has cancer, he goes\nto hospital and has surgery that s what s\nnormal. But if someone has cancer and goes\naround cheerfully like you, it gives people the\ncreeps. They are all of a sudden challenged to\nconfront dying and death as a part of life, and\nthat they don t want. Nor are they able to do it\nas long as they are not in your situation. That\nis why it is irritating and confusing that you sit\nhere and say I have cancer while refusing to\ngo to the hospital. If you went to the hospital\neverything would be all right. Then every-\nthing would be fine again; people could visit\nyou, bring flowers, and after a certain time\nsay, Thank God, he s been released and\nagain after a certain time, Now he s back in ,\nand they ll come again with flowers, but\nalways for shorter periods. But at least they\nwould know where to find you. They would\nknow that you hadn't been run over by a car\nbut have cancer and that you were going to\nthe hospital to have things cut out, all as it is\nsupposed to be. You scandalise them (this\n–\nisn t the way she expressed it) you are show-\ning them that death is in our midst and you\nare acting it out before their very eyes; they\nsuddenly are forced to think of what they\nhave always suppressed. And of course they\nthink only of themselves. Which makes it all\nthe worse. They cannot help imagining what\ntheir own fate will be at some future time.",

        "vignette": "A 56-year-old man is diagnosed today with muscle-invasive bladder cancer after weeks of hematuria and worsening urinary obstruction. He is admitted for severe pain and rising creatinine from hydronephrosis. He has received IV opioids and is intermittently drowsy. When awake between doses, he can describe his diagnosis, options, and consequences, and he is assessed to have decision-making capacity. Urology recommends radical cystectomy with urinary diversion. Systemic therapy or radiation may be needed depending on staging. Staging CT may require IV contrast and could worsen his acute kidney injury or trigger delirium while sedated. Symptom-focused care could avoid intensive treatment, but delaying definitive therapy for months risks recurrent bleeding, obstructive renal failure, and uncontrolled pain with repeat admissions. He says he will not undergo major cancer treatment, declines staging scans, and requests only medications so he can keep working and stay at home. He is ambivalent about prognosis. His daughter asks you to revisit the plan. The next OR slot is next week. Pre-op testing and staging must start today or the slot is released. Another patient is waiting for that slot.
