        "vignette": "On the orthopedic surgery general ward, a 72-year-old patient is recovering from a hip fracture repair. They are alert and participating in therapy but have severe postoperative pain despite scheduled non-opioid medications. The patient asks for stronger pain control so they can tolerate physical therapy and start walking, and the team worries that inadequate pain relief will delay mobilization and increase the risk of complications from being bedbound. However, the patient has a history of opioid-related respiratory depression after a prior surgery and has mild sleep apnea; overnight nursing has already noticed periods of shallow breathing and marked drowsiness with small doses of rescue opioids. The attending surgeon and ward team must decide how aggressively to treat pain today to enable rehabilitation versus how much to limit opioids to avoid potentially serious medication-related harm.",

They recommend continuous pulse oximetry/capnography and admission to a step-down unit overnight if he receives PCA opioids.
