      "source_text": "This case concerns a woman, Beth Brown, who receives a routine request to attend a breast cancer screening clinic. Believing herself to be at high risk of developing breast cancer because of familial patterns, and additionally concerned also for her own daughters, she asks her GP to refer her also for genetic testing for the mutations implicated in some breast cancers. The case raises practical ethical issues about patients and practitioners understanding of genetic testing, the right to know and genetic determinism, as well as the overall question of how someone like Beth can live with a degree of uncertainty which not even the most sophisticated genetic test can entirely dispel. The situation is further complicated by the fact that in cases where the test is carried out against the background of a family pedigree conferring high risk, a negative (i.e. good news) test result can fail to reduce risk sufficiently to take a woman out of a high-risk group and hence have no implications for screening/treatment.",

Her mother and a maternal aunt had breast cancer, and she believes she is “next.” She asks for hereditary breast cancer genetic testing because she wants “certainty” and says she needs to know what to tell her two teenage daughters. She has read online that a negative result would mean she can stop worrying, and a positive result would mean she should consider preventive surgery. You know that results can be hard to interpret without specialist counseling and may not change her screening plan even if negative, but testing could also reduce uncertainty and help her plan. The next genetics counseling appointment is months away, and she wants a decision before her screening visit next week. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach.",
