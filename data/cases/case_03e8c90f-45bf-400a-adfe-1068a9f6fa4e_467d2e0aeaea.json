He is in a permanent vegetative state and ventilator dependent. His wife and eight children are present in the hospital and request in writing for the ventilator to be stopped. After its removal he continues to breath. They are asking for the intravenous lines to be removed and all blood testing to be stopped. They agree that this was his wish for himself. He did not leave a written advance directive such as a living will but he clearly told his family, “I don’t want to be a vegetable.” He never designated a health-care proxy.\nWhat should you do?\na. Refer the case to the ethics committee.\nb. Obtain a court order.\nc. Refuse; you cannot ethically do this.\nd. Transfer the care of the patient to another physician.\ne.

His wife is the default decision-maker under the state hierarchy and is requesting comfort-only care. She recalls him saying he would not want life-prolonging treatment if he could not regain awareness. His adult children agree he would not want prolonged “machines,” but they disagree whether IV hydration and labs count as that. Unit protocol allows only two order sets. The current IV has failed. Replacing it today is likely to require repeated attempts and may require restraints or sedating medication, with risks of pain, bleeding, or infection. Stopping IV fluids and labs may allow dehydration or recurrent electrolyte-related symptoms. The unit is at capacity, and ongoing IV and scheduled labs use limited nursing and phlebotomy resources.",
