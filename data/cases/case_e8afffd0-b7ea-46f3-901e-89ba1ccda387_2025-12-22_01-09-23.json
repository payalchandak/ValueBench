His wife is his sole caregiver and reports she is terrified he will seize again overnight and aspirate or fall; she cannot safely restrain him and lives 35 minutes from the nearest ED. \n\nWhen asked directly, the patient is intermittently lucid but currently has decision-making capacity. He reiterates a previously documented goal: “I want to stay at home if my symptoms can be controlled; I don’t want to die in the hospital.” He says he would accept short inpatient hospice admission only if seizures cannot be managed at home.\n\nYour hospice inpatient unit has one bed left tonight. Two other referrals are pending: (1) a patient actively dying with uncontrolled pain and dyspnea in a shelter with no caregiver, and (2) a patient with end-stage heart failure whose spouse reports they cannot manage escalating agitation at home. If the last bed is used now, no beds are expected to open for at least 24 hours.\n\nClinically, inpatient admission would allow rapid titration of IV/SC benzodiazepines and antiseizure medications with continuous nursing observation, likely reducing the risk of recurrent prolonged seizures, aspiration, or traumatic injury. Home management could be attempted with an urgent comfort kit (intranasal midazolam/rectal diazepam), around-the-clock phone support, and an on-call nurse visit, but there is uncertainty about whether seizures will recur or cluster overnight and whether the wife can administer rescue medication promptly.",
