      "source_text": "Case 14-4\nTreating Donors to Optimize Organ Quality\nPeter Hendershott was transported to Provincial Hospital in a large Canadian\ncity following a serious auto accident in which he suffered massive head\ninjury. Soon it became clear that he would not recover and, in fact, was\nprogressing toward brain death.\nIn his possession at the time of the accident was an organ donor card\nindicating he would want to be a donor in the event of such an accident.\nHis family had been with him for three days and was now resigned to the\nfact that he would not recover. They initiated a conversation with the per-\nsonnel in the intensive care unit (ICU) that they knew he was an organ\ndonor. They stated clearly that they wanted something good to come from\nthis tragedy.\nThe patient had been tested for brain function. He presently did not meet\nbrain criteria for pronouncing death. The ICU attending physician explained\nthe options. They could maintain maximal life support (but acknowledged\nthat he would never recover consciousness). They could withdraw all life\nsupport and allow him to die. They expected that withdrawal of a ventilator\nwould probably result in death based on stoppage of heart function over the\ncourse of the next day or so.\nWhen the family again raised the question of organ donation, the ICU\nteam indicated that might be possible but were concerned that prolonged\ndeterioration would make donation after circulatory death (DCD) unlikely\nand that waiting for brain death criteria to be met might take so long that\nhis organs would no longer be usable.\nThe attending physician was aware of another possibility. They could\nmedicate him using vasopressor and heparin, not for Mr. Hendershott’s\nbenefit, but in order to preserve the organs for transplant. Their concern,\nhowever, was that these drugs could pose a slight risk of hastening the\ndeath. This might happen, for example, if Mr. Hendershott had a slow in-\nternal bleed that would be made worse by the heparin. They also expressed\nconcern of another kind. Maintaining Mr. Hendershott on a ventilator\ncould pose the possibility that he would stabilize and never progress to\nbrain death. He could remain in a coma and not die even if the ventilator\nwere disconnected. Since the physicians and family were in agreement\nthat it was not serving Mr. Hendershott's interest to preserve his life any\nlonger, the physician believed that stabilizing him in a coma that could\nlast for months or even years would actually be a bad outcome for him.\nSince the attending physician in the ICU believed his sole duty was to\nwork for Mr. Hendershott's interest and not to promote the agenda of the\ntransplant team, he felt that he could, in good conscience, neither admin-\nister vasopressors and heparin, which could count as actively killing the\npatient, nor maintain the ventilator, which could inappropriately preserve\nhis life.\nThe family still insisted that Mr. Hendershott would want everything\ndone to make his organs transplantable, especially since he would not\nsuffer in any way from the drugs or the ventilator.",

Serial exams show no meaningful chance of regaining consciousness, but he does not yet meet criteria for brain death. He carries a signed organ donor registration, and his family says he repeatedly wanted donation if this ever happened. The organ procurement team explains that organ quality may decline if his blood pressure worsens or if he dies slowly after withdrawal of ventilation. You consider starting vasopressors and giving heparin to preserve organ perfusion while continuing ventilatory support until donation is possible. These drugs are not expected to improve his neurologic outcome and could worsen an unrecognized internal bleed. The family asks you to “do whatever helps donation.” A decision is needed today because procurement plans must be finalized within hours, and hospital policy permits either approach.",

        "vignette": "A 42-year-old man is comatose and ventilator-dependent in the ICU after a severe traumatic brain injury. He lacks decision-making capacity. Serial exams and imaging suggest an extremely poor neurologic prognosis and recovery to independent function is not expected, but there remains uncertainty about whether he could progress to minimal consciousness. He does not meet criteria for brain death. He has a signed organ donor registration, and his family reports he repeatedly wanted donation, but he also told them he would not want to be kept on machines “for long” if recovery was unlikely. He is receiving analgesia and sedation. The team is preparing for donation after circulatory determination of death. The organ procurement organization asks whether you will follow the hospital’s donor-management pathway, which requires starting vasopressors and giving heparin before withdrawal, or proceed directly to comfort-focused withdrawal without premortem organ-preserving drugs. Vasopressors have been used intermittently for hypotension. Heparin could increase bleeding and transfusion needs if he has occult injuries, and donor management would likely prolong ICU support and invasive monitoring for hours. Withdrawal now may reduce the chance of successful organ recovery. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach with surrogate authorization, and OR availability requires a decision within hours.",
