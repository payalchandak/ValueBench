        "vignette": "A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute chest pain and ST-segment elevation on ECG consistent with a large anterior myocardial infarction. He arrived within the optimal window for primary percutaneous coronary intervention, which offers the best chance of salvaging myocardium and preventing heart failure. However, the catheterization lab is currently occupied with a scheduled case, and activating the team for an emergency procedure would require canceling three elective cases already scheduled for today—cases that have been postponed twice before due to similar emergencies. These elective patients include individuals with severe stable angina who have been waiting weeks for relief of debilitating symptoms that limit their daily functioning. The cardiology attending must decide whether to activate the emergency catheterization protocol now to optimize this patient's outcome, or to initiate thrombolytic therapy as a bridge and schedule catheterization after the elective cases, accepting a somewhat lower chance of optimal myocardial salvage for the acute patient but preserving access for the waiting patients.",
