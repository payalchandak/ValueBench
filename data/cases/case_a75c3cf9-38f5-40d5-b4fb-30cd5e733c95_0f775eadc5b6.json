        "vignette": "A detainee is brought to your military hospital for a pre-transfer clearance exam. He is alert, understands his situation, and can explain the options. You note contact burns with a distinct pattern and older fractures at different stages of healing that raise concern for inflicted injury, though the exact mechanism is unclear. He asks you not to document suspected abuse or file any safety report. He declines photographs and requests that the record stay limited to medical facts because he fears reprisals if custody staff learn you raised concerns. The clearance form and your note will be viewable by command medical staff before tomorrow morning’s transfer. The receiving facility is run by the same unit. You have no authority to delay the transfer or admit him for observation. There is no independent ombuds or external reporting route available before the deadline. Under installation policy, adding concern for non-accidental injury triggers an internal safety report. This typically prompts an urgent command medical review and may lead to temporary separation from involved custody staff for re-evaluation. Reports may also be shared with the unit on a need-to-know basis and have previously led to retaliation allegations. Clinicians may instead document only objective findings when there is no immediate medical emergency. If you defer reporting until after transfer, access to the record and follow-up is limited and protective action is often delayed. You must choose what to enter today.",
