      "source_text": "CASE 77:\nBRAINSTEM DEATH\nHolly Poulter is 35 years old. She had been trying to conceive over the past 5 years and was\nsuccessful after three cycles of IVF. At 23 weeks gestation, she was discovered unconscious at\nhome by her husband. She was rushed to hospital but deteriorated further in the A&E depart-\nment. She required intubating and was transferred to ITU. Over the next few days multiple\ntests are performed to try and determine the cause of collapse. She is found to have suffered\na catastrophic intracranial haemorrhage. Despite multiple attempts to wean ventilation and\nsee if she could breathe alone, there was no return of spontaneous respiration. Review by two\nindependent consultants confirms that she has suffered brainstem death and that there is\nno chance of recovery. The review and scan by the obstetricians show that she has a healthy\n23 week live foetus.\nHer husband pleads that the life support machine is not switched off in order to nurture the\nbaby to a viable gestation. He feels that this is what Holly would have wanted.\nQuestions\n• What tests are performed to diagnose brainstem death?\n• Does a person who is declared dead have any interests?\n• Is it lawful and ethical for somatic support to be continued until viability of\nthe foetus?",

Despite intensive care, she shows no signs of neurological recovery. Two independent consultants confirm brainstem death, and there is no possibility of her regaining consciousness or spontaneous respiration. Imaging confirms the fetus is healthy and developing normally. Her husband requests that mechanical ventilation and somatic support be continued for several more weeks to allow the fetus to reach viability, stating he believes this is what his wife would have wanted. He has no written documentation of her wishes regarding this specific scenario.
