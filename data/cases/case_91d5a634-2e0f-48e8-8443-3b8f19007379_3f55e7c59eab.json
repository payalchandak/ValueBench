He then says he plans to “make him pay” and that he will kill him “when the time is right.” He will not give a date. He refuses to share the supervisor’s address and will not allow you to contact anyone at work. He denies owning weapons but describes rehearsing how he would do it. He wants to leave the clinic and says he will never return if you “betray” him. You can request an emergency evaluation, but the threshold for holding him is not clear.
