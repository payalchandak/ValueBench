      "source_text": "Case 17-2\nDisclosing the Experience of a Surgeon\nAngus McBride had recently retired from a career working on an assembly\nline in a Michigan auto factory. He had long been bothered by gastroeso-\nphogeal reflux disease (GERD). Reflux of gastric acid produces an unpleas-\nant sensation resulting from an improperly functioning sphincter between\nthe stomach and the esophagus that permits the upward flow of stomach\ncontents, especially gastric acid.\nMr. McBride's internist, William Arnold, had monitored the esophageal\nproblems for several years. Treatment had included antacids, histamine\nblockers (ranitidine or Zantac), and proton pump inhibitors including esome-\nprazole (Nexium). Dr. Arnold had noted increasing irritation of the lining of\nthe esophagus and the emergence of a condition known as Barrett's esopha-\ngus, in which some of its lining is modified with cells resembling intestinal\ncells replacing the normal tissue. This, in itself, is not harmful but is associ-\nated with the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of the\ncancer is at least 30 percent higher in people with Barrett's esophagus and\nperhaps as much as double. The patient's condition had progressed to the\npoint that it now involved severe dysplasia.\nMx. McBride's risk of developing adenocarcinoma remained small, less\nthan | percent, but the consequences would be severe. Dr. Arnold referred\nMr. McBride to Dr. Rachel Herbert, the chair of laparoscopic surgery at the\ncity's most prestigious teaching hospital. Dr. Herbert agreed with Dr. Arnold's\ndiagnosis. When the condition worsened, she recommended removal of the\nportion of the esophagus that manifested the abnormal cells. This would\nreduce the risk of the cells becoming cancerous. This was a major opera-\ntion but should result in an elimination or reduction of the risks associated\nwith Barrett's esophagus. She explained the risks and benefits. The proce-\ndure would be done laparoscopically, that is, using instruments that could\nbe passed through small slits in the skin, thereby making the intervention\nmuch less invasive. Dr. Herbert was one of the country’s most experienced\nlaparoscropic surgeons, having pioneered the techniques for several lapa-\nroscopic procedures. —\nShe had one concern about the consent for the procedure. Although she\nwas a world-class laparoscopic surgeon, most of her experience was in in-\ntestinal procedures and in sterilization of women who wanted their tubes\ntied using the laparoscopic technique. She had only performed two previous\nesophageal procedures laparoscopically. Thus, although she was a leading\nsurgeon, she was relatively new at this particular procedure. She feared that\ntelling Mr. McBride this would alarm him and could even drive him to con-\nsider alternatives, such as getting the operation done at another hospital.\nShe was convinced this was not in Mr. McBride’s interest. Although other\nhospitals had surgeons who might be more experienced at the esophageal\nprocedure, she believed her extensive experience with other laparascopic\nprocedures and the high quality of her hospital made it better for Mr. McBride\nto have her do the operation. In reviewing the elements of an adequately in-\nformed consent, should Dr. Herbert explain her relative inexperience?",

        "vignette": "A man with Barrett’s esophagus has multifocal high-grade dysplasia despite prior endoscopic eradication therapy. After counseling on surveillance, repeat endoscopic therapy, and esophagectomy, he chose a minimally invasive (laparoscopic) esophagectomy. Surgery is scheduled for tomorrow. The workup is complete and an OR slot is available. He traveled far and arranged limited family support and time off. Further delay for referral would require new authorization and repeat staging, and it would likely take months. Delay also increases the risk of progression to esophageal adenocarcinoma. You are credentialed for this operation and routinely perform complex foregut surgery, but you have limited independent experience with this specific laparoscopic approach. An experienced esophageal surgeon will be on standby to assist or take over if needed, but cannot assume the case as primary surgeon on short notice. The patient is highly anxious and tends to cancel or postpone plans when alarmed. If major complications occur and he later learns your limited experience, he may feel misled and lose trust. Hospital policy and state law allow either approach to discussing operator experience.",
