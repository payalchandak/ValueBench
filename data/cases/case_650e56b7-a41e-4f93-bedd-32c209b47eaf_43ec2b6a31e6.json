      "source_text": "Case 8-5 :\nProfiting from Self-Referral for MRIs\nFor many years internist Jonathan Birch had performed x-rays on his pa-\ntients in his private office. He billed them a reasonable charge for the time\nand materials involved, including enough to amortize the costs of the\nequipment. By the late 1980s Dr. Birch was making increased use of more\nsophisticated imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. By comparison, this equip-\nment was extremely expensive and would not be utilized sufficiently to\njustify having the equipment in his office. He began referring patients\nneeding this type of diagnostic test to an imaging center at the local hos-\npital. Patients were billed directly by the hospital. This had the effect of\nreducing Dr. Birch’s income that he used to derive from the simpler in-\noffice procedures.\nIn 1989 Dr. Birch was approached by Imaging Resources, Inc., about a\nnew free-standing imaging facility it was launching. Dr. Birch was invited\nto visit the facility and inspect its state-of-the-art equipment. Dr. Birch was\nimpressed. He considered it better than the hospital's facility and was con-\nsidering shifting his referrals to the new center.\nThe director of the center then presented an offer to Dr. Birch. He was\ninvited to invest in the center. He could buy a 1 percent interest in the facil-\nity with income on the investment projected as 12 percent. Furthermore, the\nfacility would loan Dr. Birch the money he needed to make the investment\nat 6 percent interest with the interest and principal paid off with the earn-\nings on the investment. As soon as the investment was paid off, Dr. Birch\nwould own his share in the company and would receive profits on his\nownership.\nDr. Birch realized that the more patients he referred, the better the im-\naging business would do. In effect, he would be able to recoup some of the\nincome he had lost when he shifted from x-rays in his office to the use of the\noutside imaging facility at the hospital. Dr. Birch was vaguely uncomfort-\nable with the offer he received. It could be interpreted as giving him an\nownership interest in order to influence his decisions about when to order\nimaging and what facility to recommend. He was made more uncomfort-\nable when he learned that only physicians were being offered the favor-\nable investment terms. He learned that only colleagues who did substantial\namounts of referral for imaging were approached. Even so, Dr. Birch accepted\nthe offer and the loan.\nFollow-up\nBy 1991 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was taking action\nagainst some of these joint-venture investment schemes that gave the ap-\npearance of being designed to provide financial incentives to physicians to\nchannel business to certain imaging centers. There were accusations of\nkickbacks. In response, the government issued regulations that provided\n“safe harbors,” provisions which, if met, would give physicians assurance\nthat they would not be guilty of violating anti-kickback laws. The original\nprovisions made clear that investment in large, public corporations (such as\ndrug companies) was acceptable, that physicians could provide services to\njoint ventures for a reasonable fee, and that investment terms (such as the\nloan received by Dr. Birch) had to be available to all investors, not just doc-\ntors who referred patients.* Later amendments clarified these provisions, but\nthey remain in place essentially as originally promulgated. More recently,\nregulations governing self-referral have appeared in 2001, 2004, and 2007,\nand in 2010 a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol was published pur-\nsuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).°\nAs a result of these regulations, Dr. Birch decided to repay the loan and\nmade an effort to assure that the company made a good faith effort to con-\nform to all the provisions of the safe-harbor regulations. He was convinced\nthat the company, of which he was now a minority owner, was the best fa-\ncility in town and that he would never refer a patient in order to increase\nthe profits of the company. Still, he was concerned about whether this ar-\nrangement was ethical.",

        "vignette": "A 54-year-old man has severe low back pain with bilateral sciatica and intermittent leg heaviness. He reports urinary hesitancy but no incontinence. Exam shows intact rectal tone and perineal sensation. There is no objective foot drop. Bedside bladder scan is normal after voiding. He is afebrile and hemodynamically stable. Cauda equina syndrome is not definite, but neurologic deterioration can occur within hours and would require rapid hospital-level treatment. Neurosurgery advises lumbar MRI within 24 hours and says either pathway is acceptable if he can return immediately for new weakness, numbness, or retention. The ED is on divert with prolonged boarding, and MRI there may be delayed beyond 24 hours. He has had severe agitation during prior ED boarding that required sedation or restraints. A freestanding center can do MRI today, and insurance coverage is similar, but it cannot monitor him. You own a small passive stake in the center, and disclosure is documented. He asks what you recommend, and you must place one referral now.",
