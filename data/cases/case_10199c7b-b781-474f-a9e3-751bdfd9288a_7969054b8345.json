CT and exam suggest rising intracranial pressure. Neurosurgery advises decompression tonight. Delaying until morning could leave him with irreversible neurologic injury. His other bleeding has been controlled and his blood pressure is stable. Transfusion might not be needed, but it could become necessary if hemorrhage is difficult to control. His parents are the default surrogates and refuse any donor blood products as Jehovah’s Witnesses. They report he recently began attending services and told them he would refuse blood even if it meant dying, but he never completed paperwork. A friend says he was considering the faith but was not committed. A court order cannot be obtained in time, and hospital counsel says either course is legally permissible under local emergency and surrogate standards.",
