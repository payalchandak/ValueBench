        "vignette": "A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute stroke symptoms that began two hours ago. She is a candidate for thrombolytic therapy, which could significantly reduce her disability if administered promptly. However, the patient has a documented history of a small cerebral aneurysm discovered incidentally on imaging six months ago. While the aneurysm was deemed low-risk at the time and not requiring intervention, thrombolytic therapy carries a substantially elevated risk of aneurysm rupture in her case, which could result in catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage and death. The stroke team must decide immediately. The emergency department is in a public hospital serving a predominantly underserved community with very limited intensive care beds. Administering thrombolytics to this patient would require reserving an ICU bed for close monitoring given her hemorrhage risk, and the ICU is currently at capacity with one bed being held for anticipated admissions from a scheduled complex surgery and expected trauma cases tonight. Releasing that bed for this patient would mean canceling the surgery and potentially having no ICU capacity for critically ill patients who may arrive later in the shift. You are the attending neurologist and must decide now.",

To neutralize: describe both options' clinical consequences in balanced qualitative terms (e.g., 'thrombolysis may reduce stroke disability but carries serious hemorrhage risk; withholding avoids that risk but forgoes potential benefit') without suggesting one is superior. Also, remove 'substantially elevated'—use 'increased' or 'elevated' without quantifiers."

The case should either focus on the aneurysm risk trade-off OR the resource allocation question, not both simultaneously. Additionally, 'substantially elevated risk' is vague—real practice would involve neurosurgery consultation and possibly imaging the aneurysm again before proceeding. Suggested fix: Remove the ICU/resource allocation component entirely and focus on the aneurysm risk trade-off as a clinical effectiveness debate, OR remove the aneurysm and focus purely on resource allocation in a different clinical context where ICU admission is standard (e.g., deciding whether to admit this stroke patient to the single ICU bed vs. holding it for a trauma patient)."

To make this non-trivial: either (1) remove the aneurysm and create a pure resource allocation case where ICU admission is genuinely required and the trade-off is transparent, OR (2) remove the resource component and focus on patient preference vs. physician recommendation regarding aneurysm risk (e.g., patient wants treatment despite risk, physician recommends against it)."
