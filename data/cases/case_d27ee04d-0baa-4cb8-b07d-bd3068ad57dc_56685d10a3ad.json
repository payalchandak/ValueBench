Her hand is warm and well perfused, but she has severe pain with movement. X-rays and likely closed reduction with procedural sedation are recommended to restore alignment and avoid worsening swelling. The babysitter says the parents are out of contact and provides no written authorization. Staff have tried multiple numbers and left urgent messages. The reduction is not strictly lifesaving, but delaying definitive care could prolong pain and make treatment harder later. Sedation carries real risks.
