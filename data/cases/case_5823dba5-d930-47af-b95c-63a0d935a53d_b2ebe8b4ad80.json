        "vignette": "On the general medicine ward, a 58-year-old man with long-standing type 1 diabetes is recovering after admission for a serious hypoglycemic episode at home. He is now alert, stable, and demonstrates clear understanding when the team reviews his condition and the hospital’s insulin orders. He insists on managing his diabetes himself using his personal continuous glucose monitor and insulin pen, explaining that the hospital sliding-scale regimen has repeatedly made him “swing” and that he knows how to adjust doses based on meals and symptoms. Nursing staff are concerned that self-dosing in the hospital could lead to another severe low (especially overnight), missed documentation, or double-dosing if staff also administer insulin, but the patient says he will refuse insulin altogether if he is not allowed to manage it his way. The attending physician must decide how insulin will be administered during the rest of his hospitalization.",

He is alert, oriented, and demonstrates intact decision-making capacity in a structured discussion: he accurately explains his pump settings, correction factors, sick-day rules, how he treats hypoglycemia, and can repeat back the risks and benefits of inpatient insulin options. He strongly prefers to self-manage his insulin, describing prior hospitalizations when staff-administered insulin was delayed or mistimed relative to meals, resulting in marked hyperglycemia and feelings of lost independence.\n\nOver the last 12 hours, his intake has been unpredictable (skipped dinner due to nausea; may be NPO overnight for imaging). He has mild acute kidney injury (creatinine 0.9 → 1.4 mg/dL) and is receiving IV antibiotics and systemic steroids, both of which are expected to change insulin needs. Earlier this evening he developed severe hypoglycemia (fingerstick glucose 38 mg/dL) with confusion that required IV dextrose. He reports he did not feel his usual adrenergic warning symptoms; he takes metoprolol, which can blunt hypoglycemia awareness.\n\nHospital policy prohibits patients from administering their own insulin unless they are enrolled in a formal inpatient diabetes self-management protocol with nursing verification, which is not currently available overnight. The night team must enter insulin orders now for overnight corrections and breakfast coverage. The clinician must decide whether to prioritize the patient’s control over his diabetes care or restrict self-administration due to an immediate safety risk after recent severe hypoglycemia with masked symptoms, while also considering fairness and consistency with hospital policy.",
