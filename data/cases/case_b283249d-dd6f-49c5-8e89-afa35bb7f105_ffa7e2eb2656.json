Having one person from the practice doing this ensures that there\nis good continuity of care for patients with complex needs. The GP can also get to know their\npatients, the relatives and the care home staff well.\nDuring your weekly visit to Rosemary Cottage Care Home you are asked to rewrite and sign a\nletter stating that the staff can continue giving Doris her anti-psychotic medication covertly.\nIn the past Doris had suffered with schizophrenia, and although her hallucinations have not\nbeen evident for many years, she is still prone to periods of increased agitation and paranoia.\nThese seem to have improved since starting a small dose of risperidone every night which was\ninitiated by her previous GP.\nAlthough you had known that Doris was receiving this medication you had not been aware\nthat it was being crushed up and given with her evening cocoa. On the few occasions you\nhad seen Doris for other reasons she had always come across as calm and able to make her\nown decisions.\nQuestions\n• Is covert medication ever justifiable?\n• Should Doris be told that she has been given medication with a view to negotiating\ninformed consent?",

Staff report intermittent evenings of fearfulness and suspicion that can escalate to pacing and shouting. A low nightly dose of risperidone was started by the prior GP and staff feel it has reduced these episodes. Today the nurse asks you to reauthorize the medication and signs of nonadherence have appeared. She then tells you the tablet has been crushed and mixed into Doris’s cocoa because Doris often refuses pills and says staff are “trying to drug” her. When you ask Doris about medicines, she says she takes none and wants to be left alone. The home’s policy and state law allow either covert administration for a patient judged to lack decision-making capacity or a plan to stop and seek informed consent. You must decide before the next refill is dispensed.",

One resident was knocked over during a corridor confrontation. When risperidone doses were missed last week, she again pushed toward the exit and staff had to block the door and call an ambulance for emergency sedation. A prior GP started low‑dose nightly risperidone. Staff think severe episodes are less frequent, but she is often sleepy in the mornings and recently stumbled and fell to her knees. Night staff are thinly staffed, and repeated 1:1 monitoring pulls care from other residents. The tablet has been crushed into cocoa because Doris refuses pills and believes staff are trying to drug her. Today she can repeat the drug name but cannot reliably explain its purpose or weigh side effects when suspicious. She has no reachable guardian. The pharmacy requires your signed reauthorization today. Hospital policy and state law allow either option here, and she is not under an involuntary treatment order.",
