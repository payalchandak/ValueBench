      "source_text": "The case of Mr C\nMr C, a 68-year-old patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, developed gangrene in a foot during his confinement in a secure hospital. He was removed to a general hospital, where the consultant surgeon diagnosed that he was likely to die imminently if the leg was not amputated below the knee. The prognosis was that he had a 15% chance of survival without amputation. Mr C refused to consider amputation. The hospital authorities considered whether the operation could be performed without Mr C’s consent and made arrangements for a solicitor to see him concerning his competence to give a reasoned decision. In the meantime, treatment with antibiotics and conservative surgery averted the immediate threat of imminent death, but the hospital refused to give an understanding to the solicitor that in recognition of his repeated refusals it would not amputate in any future circumstances. There was a possibility that Mr C would develop gangrene again. An application was made on Mr C’s behalf to the court for an injunction restraining the hospital from carrying out an amputation without his express written consent. On behalf of the hospital it was contended that Mr C’s capacity to give a definitive decision had been impaired by his mental illness and that he had failed to appreciate the risk of death if the operation was not performed. (Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) [1994] 1 All ER 819.)\nNow consider the following additional facts. Which, if any, is relevant?\n* Mr C had emigrated from Jamaica in 1956, with his passage paid by the woman with whom he had lived since 1949. He stabbed her after she left him in 1961.\n* Since that time Mr C had been confined either in prison or in a secure hospital.\n* For the past six years he had been accommodated in an open ward and was described as having ‘mellowed’, having become more sociable and even-tempered.\n* Mr C was very adept with finances; he had saved all of his earnings during his 30 years’ time in the secure hospital.\n* However, when his solicitor asked him to whom he intended to leave his savings, he replied ‘I’ll leave it for myself, for when I come back’.\n* Mr C’s delusions included the belief that he was a world-famous vascular surgeon who had never lost a patient.\n* Mr C also believed that his doctors were torturers.\n* Mr C’s refusal of amputation reflected his religious convictions, although it was not part of a formal creed.",

He is febrile and the leg is becoming increasingly tender and discolored despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and debridement.

He says the doctors are torturers and insists he is a famous vascular surgeon who “never loses a patient.” He also describes a personal religious conviction that his body must remain intact.
