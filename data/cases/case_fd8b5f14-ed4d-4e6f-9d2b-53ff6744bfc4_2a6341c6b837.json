You are the full-time employee of an outpatient facility run by a managed-care plan and you have recently received written instructions not to bring up subjects such as bone marrow transplantation in myeloma with patients. The reasoning was that they are outrageously expensive and do not cure the disease, although it may extend survival. The data that they extend survival are not entirely conclusive. In addition, in a private meeting with the medical director, you have been told that the expenditures per patient load of care of each of the physicians would be examined yearly to determine which physician would be promoted.\nWhat do you do?\na. Fully inform the patient about the risks and benefits of bone marrow transplantation.\nb. Refer your patient to an oncologist to have this discussion.\nc. Transfer the patient to another primary-care provider.\nd. Advise the patient to fde suit against the managed care plan.\ne. Inform the patient about bone marrow transplantation if he asks you about it.",

In a separate meeting, you were also told that physicians’ annual promotions will consider per-patient spending patterns. The patient looks to you for a frank discussion and says they want to make the best choice for their life and family.",
