      "source_text": "Case 11-5\nEmbryo Biopsy\nIt was only a few months after an IVF procedure was approved at Midwest\nMedical Center that a proposal was presented to the Ethics Committee for\ndiscussion and approval of a new procedure that would expand on IVF.\nThe procedure, referred to as embryo biopsy, allows for PGD for simple\ngene defects such as Huntington disease and cystic fibrosis (CF) in em-\nbryos. For couples who have had a CF child in the past and are worried\nabout having another, physicians could offer standard IVF protocol with\nthe following additional steps: the sample used to infer genetic composi-\ntion includes polar bodies removed on day one after fertilization and one or\ntwo blastomeres on day three of cleavage-stage embryo development (the\nsix- to eight-cell stage). The embryos that do not have the defect would be\nimplanted in the mother’s womb, ensuring that their child or children would\nnot have the gene nor be able to pass the gene on to their children.\nDr. Thomas Sobeira, a member of the ethics committee, had deep con-\ncerns about this proposal for “embryo biopsy.” He was concerned about how\naccurate the test was and the potential for misdiagnosis. Even though the\nprevention of CF seemed an admirable goal, he was also concerned about\nopening the door to separating fetuses we wish to develop from those we\nwish to discontinue. In addition, a child with CF is not doomed to death in\n- infancy. In 2009, the median predicted age of survival for CF patients was in\nthe mid-30s, and there is no intellectual or behavioral impairment. Gene\ntherapy offers great promise for treatment. In the meantime, however, the\nchild is likely to be chronically ill and require repeated hospitalizations.",

Fertilization has produced several day‑3 embryos, and a transfer is scheduled for tomorrow. They ask you to add embryo biopsy with preimplantation genetic testing so you can choose embryos that appear unaffected. Your center can perform the biopsy in-house, but the lab has limited experience with this specific assay. Results can be indeterminate, and biopsy or freezing can compromise embryo viability. A false result could lead to discarding an embryo that could have become a healthy child or transferring an embryo believed to be unaffected that later proves to have CF.

Biopsy and freezing carry a small but real risk of embryo damage or loss and may delay transfer until treatment is unaffordable. The CLIA‑certified lab has validated PGT‑M for this mutation, but it runs the assay infrequently and sometimes returns indeterminate or discordant calls. A misleading result could lead to selecting an embryo that later has CF or to discarding an embryo labeled affected or indeterminate. The couple would not terminate an affected pregnancy and does not want invasive prenatal diagnosis. Shipping embryos to an outside lab is not feasible for this cycle. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach. You must decide today.",
