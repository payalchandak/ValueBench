      "source_text": "Section 2: Valid consent, mental\ncapacity and best interests\n–\nA case of genetic research\nThe research ethics committee of a major teaching\nhospital receives a proposal from researchers associ-\nated with a major migraine clinic asking for permis-\nsion to do gene tests on their clinic patients and their\nfamilies. The researchers are particularly interested to\ndiscover whether one variant of a gene called ApoE is\nassociated with migraine.\nMost of the patients at the clinic are young. The\nclinic has an excellent reputation and good loyalty\nfrom its patients. Indeed, the research ethics commit-\ntee knows that the researchers concerned are one of the\nteams in the hospital with an international reputation\nfor excellent research.\nA problem arises, however, because the team men-\ntions in its application that, in addition to its suspected\nassociation with migraine, variants of the ApoE gene\nthey wish to study may also be associated with early-\nage onset of Alzheimer s disease. Because of this\n’\npotential link, they suggest that they should keep the\ngenetic information they obtain to themselves and\nnot advise the patients and families.\nThey say, rightly, that the implications of having\nthe ApoE allele are not completely clear, and in any\ncase they have neither the time nor the money to\norganize counselling. They also say that their study is\nvery much related to migraine, and that if there is a\n’\nrisk of Alzheimer s disease, the onset will be many\nyears in the future, and telling people would only\ncreate unnecessary worry.",

Her sample has already been analyzed, and the report shows a variant sometimes linked to earlier-onset Alzheimer disease, though the meaning for any one person is uncertain and there is no clear prevention plan. The study budget does not cover genetic counseling, and your next clinic visit with her is today before she moves out of state.
