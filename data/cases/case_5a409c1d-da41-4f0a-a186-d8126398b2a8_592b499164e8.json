His delusions included the belief that his doctors were torturers, whilst he himself was a world-famous specialist in the treatment of diseased limbs. When his own foot became infected, he therefore hid his condition from medical personnel until it had actually become gangrenous. His doctors believed that unless his foot was amputated, he stood an 80% to 85% chance of dying.\r\nMr C, however, refused to consent to the amputation, saying that he would rather die intact than survive with only one foot. He sought reassurances from the hospital that his foot would not be amputated without his consent if he slipped into a coma. The health authority in charge of the hospital refused to give an undertaking not to amputate his foot without his consent. Mr C then sought a High Court order to prevent amputation if he became unconscious.",

He is afebrile and normotensive, but inflammatory markers are rising and the surgical team expects progression to sepsis or death within days without source control. Vascular and podiatry consultants have ruled out limb-sparing procedures, and transfer is not feasible. Surgeons recommend below-knee amputation as definitive treatment. IV antibiotics and debridement could temporize symptoms, but they are unlikely to prevent worsening necrosis. He refuses amputation and cites a long-standing preference, documented when stable years ago, to avoid losing a limb even if it shortens his life. He can repeat risks and alternatives, but he insists staff are trying to mutilate him and cannot consider that this belief might be mistaken. Surgery deems him capable; psychiatry does not. There is no surrogate and no court review is available before the OR schedule is finalized today. Counsel confirms both honoring his refusal and proceeding with amputation after capacity loss are legally permissible, and that waiting would increase operative risk.",
