      "source_text": "CASE 48:\nAPPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT UNDER THE\nMENTAL HEALTH ACT\nRobson is in his 40s and has paranoid schizophrenia. He has been assessed to lack capacity\nwith respect to decision making about treatment for his condition. Over the past 20 years he\nhas been detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (MHA 1983, as amended 2007)\nmany times but has never gained insight into his illness and has not engaged with treatment.\nHe is currently detained at an inpatient unit. In the past and during his current admission he\nhas been treated with a depot antipsychotic medication which is administered by an injection\nevery 2 weeks, but because he resists, he needs to be restrained to administer the injection.\nThe treating team considers that the current depot medication prevents his mental state\nfrom deteriorating. However, they are now considering whether to try clozapine, which\nis recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to treat\npatients with ‘treatment-resistant’ schizophrenia, i.e., if they have not responded to two\ndifferent a ntipsychotic medications. Clozapine would have to be administered orally, and\nRobson would have to have regular blood tests to monitor him as the treatment has serious\nand potentially fatal side effects. The team hopes that this new medication may result in an\nimprovement in Robson’s mental health and enables him to gain insight into his condition,\nthus promoting engagement with his treatment plan.\nQuestion\n• Should a person be compulsorily detained under the MHA if the treatment provided\ndoes not improve his mental condition?",

For years he has received a depot antipsychotic injection every two weeks. He resists each time and staff use physical restraint to administer it. On this regimen he is usually calmer and less paranoid, but he has never developed insight and repeatedly relapses after discharge because he will not engage with follow-up care. The team is considering clozapine for treatment-resistant illness. It is taken orally and requires frequent blood tests and close monitoring, and it can cause rare but life-threatening complications. He is likely to refuse tablets and venipuncture, which could mean repeated restraint for both. The next injection is due tomorrow and baseline labs would need to be drawn this week.

        "vignette": "A man in his 40s with long-standing paranoid schizophrenia is detained on an inpatient unit under an involuntary treatment order and has been found to lack capacity for antipsychotic decisions. For years he has received the same biweekly depot injection. Staff report fewer acute behavioral escalations on it, but his paranoia and functioning have not meaningfully improved despite an optimized dose and interval. He requires physical restraint for nearly every injection. He has had repeated restraint-related bruising and a prior shoulder subluxation, and he becomes more avoidant of staff afterward. He repeatedly refuses venipuncture and daily oral medication and states he wants to remain on the depot. The team is considering clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. It could reduce psychosis and future hospitalizations and may end repeated forced injections, but it requires frequent blood monitoring and daily dosing. Missed labs could delay detection of agranulocytosis, myocarditis, or seizures. Reliable outpatient monitoring after discharge is doubtful. The unit has limited staff for restraint and phlebotomy, and inpatient beds are scarce. A court review in two days requires a committed plan, and policy and state law allow either course under the existing order.",
