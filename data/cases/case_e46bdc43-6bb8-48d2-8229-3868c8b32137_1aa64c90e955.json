The family left Sierra Leone because of war and\ncontinuing political unrest and are seeking asylum in the UK. Sayida is 10 weeks pregnant\nwhen she attends the antenatal clinic for her first booking appointment, accompanied by\nher husband and a middle-aged female relative of her husband. The latter explains that she\nhas come along to act as chaperone and interpreter because Sayida speaks no English and\nher husband very little. During initial assessment it transpires that a friend already living in\nLondon has told Sayida about the African Well Woman Clinic (AWWC) and Sayida’s hus-\nband has telephoned for an appointment. Through the interpreter Sayida explains that she\nhad problems with her first pregnancy and during the birth, and her friend has told her that\nthe AWWC would be able to help her with this and ‘difficulties’ she has had since the birth\nof her daughter.\nClinical examination by a female genital mutilation (FGM) public health specialist reveals\nthat Sayida has FGM III and is presenting with symptoms consistent with problems associ-\nated with urinary tract infection and the menstrual cycle.\nQuestions\n• What is FGM?\n• What are the laws in the UK regarding the practice of FGM?\n• Should a competent adult be able to consent to the procedure?\n• What is cultural relativism?",

She has limited English and arrives with her husband and an older female relative who is interpreting. Exam at a specialist clinic shows type III female genital cutting with a very small introitus. She reports chronic dysuria, difficulty with menses, and a traumatic prior delivery that required urgent cutting at the time of birth. She says she wants a safer, more controlled pregnancy this time, but also fears permanent genital change during pregnancy and worries about her family’s reaction if she is opened now. You are planning her obstetric care and must decide when, if at all, to perform deinfibulation.

        "vignette": "A 21-year-old asylum seeker is 10 weeks pregnant at her first antenatal visit. She has limited English and arrives with her husband and a female relative. You arrange a professional interpreter and speak with her alone. Exam shows a markedly narrowed introitus consistent with type III female genital cutting. She has long-standing dysuria and difficult menses but no acute retention or infection. In a prior birth, she required intrapartum deinfibulation and found it frightening. Second-trimester deinfibulation would likely relieve her urinary and menstrual symptoms and reduce the chance of emergency cutting, tearing, and severe pain or bleeding in labor. It also carries a small risk of bleeding, infection, and pregnancy loss. She states she does not want a genital procedure during pregnancy and requests deinfibulation only in labor, partly due to concerns if physical changes are noticed before delivery. Specialists consider either timing acceptable with informed consent under hospital policy and law. Elective deinfibulation is only available in a scheduled second-trimester block before 22 weeks; otherwise it must be done intrapartum. A plan is needed by her next visit to book delivery location and anesthesia.",
