      "source_text": "CASE 5:\nCASUISTRY\nYou are the Foundation Year 1 (FY1) doctor on call when you are called to the ward to see an elderly, confused man. He is wandering around and crying out. The nurses have tried persuading him to stay by his bed or at least in his bay, but he is refusing to listen to them. One female patient has become upset because he keeps going to stand at the end of her bed and stares at her. The nurses are worried that as well as upsetting other patients, he is very unsteady on his feet and they fear he may fall over and injure himself. You read his notes to try to find a cause for his confusion. You learn that Micky, 76 years old, was an elective admission yesterday for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two weeks earlier he had been admitted to Accident and Emergency with shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. He was kept in for 3 days and treated with intravenous antibiotics. There are at least two possible causes for his confusion: a recurrence of his pneumonia (or other sepsis) or a reaction to the general anaesthetic. You decide to speak to Micky and try to take some blood. Micky refuses to cooperate and actively pushes you away from him, shouting and swearing. He then tries to leave the ward, claiming he is well enough to go home and it is illegal for you to keep him a prisoner. The nurses suggest he should be physically restrained so that you can take blood and assess him, and that it may be a good idea to give him a sedative so that he does not continue to upset the other patients.\nQuestions\n• What is the ethical principle of casuistry?\n• Should you use restraint in this case?",

He wanders into other patients’ spaces and tries to leave the ward. He is unsteady and has nearly fallen. Nursing staff cannot redirect him for more than a few seconds. You suspect delirium from infection, medication effect, or postoperative complications, and you need blood tests and a focused exam before starting treatment. When approached, he yells, pushes your hands away, and refuses any blood draw or monitoring. He insists he is being held against his will. His wife cannot be reached, and delaying assessment risks missing a reversible cause and increasing his chance of injury on the ward.

        "vignette": "A 76-year-old man is postoperative day 1 after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Overnight he developed waxing-and-waning confusion. At times he answers questions appropriately, but within minutes he becomes suspicious and tries to leave the unit. During brief lucid periods, he cannot explain the risks of bleeding or CO2 retention from sedatives, and his refusal of care remains unchanged. You judge that he lacks decision-making capacity for this refusal. He has pulled at his IV and refuses vital signs, pulse oximetry, and blood draws. He says, “No needles,” and insists he can go home. He is afebrile and not in obvious respiratory distress, but you are concerned about occult bleeding, electrolyte abnormalities, or medication toxicity. His chart notes severe obstructive sleep apnea and COPD with prior CO2 retention after sedatives. Nurses report that physical restraint previously caused him to thrash and bruise. A sitter is available only until morning, when his wife is expected to arrive, and phlebotomy can attempt one more draw tonight. Hospital policy and state law permit either brief emergency sedation/restraint for evaluation or continued noncoercive care with frequent reassessment.",
