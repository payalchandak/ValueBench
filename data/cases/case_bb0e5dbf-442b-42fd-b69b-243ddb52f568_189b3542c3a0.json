The patient is on digoxin, an ACE inhibitor and a diuretic, but not a beta-blocker. You cannot find a contraindication to the use of beta-blockers either in the chart or in discussion with the patient. You ask the private attending why there is no beta-blocker and he looks at you as if you had anoxic encephalopathy. He says, “I have been in practice for 40 years. Don’t you think I know what I am doing? Beta-blockers are dangerous in congestive failure.” The patient looks proudly at the attending and says, “I have the smartest doctor in the world.”\nWhat should you do about this disagreement?\na. Wait for the attending to leave and give the patient a prescription for carvedilol.\nb. Suggest to the patient that he should find another doctor.\nc.

During this admission he has borderline low blood pressure and resting bradycardia while on digoxin. His creatinine has fluctuated with diuresis and infection-related volume shifts. You, the senior resident on service, think he could be considered for a very low-dose evidence-based beta-blocker once he is stable, but the attending prefers to defer this to outpatient cardiology. The patient says he trusts the attending and does not want new heart medications unless the attending recommends them. He wants to go home today to start arranged home IV antibiotics, but he would stay longer if inpatient cardiology review could change his heart care. Discharge medication reconciliation must be signed today. Cardiology can only see him inpatient if discharge is delayed and has one consult slot left today. Delaying discharge would keep him in a bed needed for ED boarders. Home infusion can only hold his slot for 24 hours and may reassign it, forcing him to stay inpatient for antibiotics. Hospital policy permits either approach.",
