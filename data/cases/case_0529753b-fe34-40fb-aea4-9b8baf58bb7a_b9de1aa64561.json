Due to a cancellation, she was seen later that\r\nday for the complaint of a rash on her chest. The male physician\r\ncompleted a thorough but unremarkable physical examination in the\r\npresence of a female nurse practitioner. Two weeks later, the patient\r\ncomes to the same physician's office at closing time and without an\r\nappointment. She complains of \"needing to talk to the doctor\r\nimmediately about a private matter.\" She informs the receptionist\r\nthat it is \"absolutely critical\" for her to be seen and examined for\r\nsimilar skin complaints that seem to \"come and go\" and \"itch\r\nfrequently.\" The patient is calm but insists that an appointment with\r\nthe female nurse practitioner is not acceptable and instead requests\r\nto see the physician privately, without the presence of another staff\r\nmember.\r\nWhich of the following would be the most appropriate initial response by\r\nthe physician?\r\na. Ask the patient to have a seat in the office and proceed with the unscheduled\r\nappointment.\r\nb. Have the receptionist contact security to remove the patient from the premises.\r\nc. Have the receptionist instruct the patient to schedule an appointment during\r\nnormal office hours.\r\nd.
