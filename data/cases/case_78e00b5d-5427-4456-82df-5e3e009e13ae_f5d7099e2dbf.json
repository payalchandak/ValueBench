She says she depends on him for meals, medications, and getting to appointments. She fears that if anyone intervenes he will leave, and she will be forced into a facility. She is alert, communicates clearly, and shows no signs of delirium. She is medically ready for discharge this afternoon, and her husband is due to pick her up.
