Although\nthey have both always wanted a family, Adele initially wanted to focus on her career and\nthen struggled to conceive. When she finally fell pregnant, both Adele and her husband were\nthrilled. Unfortunately, following her first trimester scan, a nuchal screening test indicated\nthat the foetus had a high risk of suffering from Down’s syndrome. She decided to undergo\nfurther diagnostic testing, and amniocentesis confirmed Down’s syndrome. The couple is\ndistraught. They had waited a long time to conceive and wanted the ‘perfect’ baby to fit into\ntheir busy lifestyles. Adele does not feel she would ever be able to return to work if she had\nto care for a disabled child and thinks having to give up her career would be detrimental to\nher mental health. After much deliberation she visits her doctor to discuss termination of\npregnancy.",

She requests a termination and says she cannot imagine raising a child with significant disability while keeping her career. She demonstrates clear understanding of the diagnosis, the range of possible developmental outcomes, and the steps of the procedure. She also understands that ending the pregnancy will permanently prevent this fetus from being born and may carry physical and emotional risks. If the pregnancy continues, she fears worsening anxiety and depression and anticipates major strain on her marriage and work. State law and hospital policy allow either termination at this gestational age or continued prenatal care. The hospital can schedule the procedure only this week before the next referral pathway adds delay.",

The pregnancy is otherwise uncomplicated. She requests termination and does not feel able to parent a child with Down syndrome given her support system, finances, and mental health. She demonstrates decisional capacity and understands prognostic uncertainty and procedural risks, including that termination ends the pregnancy and results in fetal demise. You are the only clinician in your hospital credentialed to perform a second-trimester termination this week. You have a longstanding conscientious objection to termination for fetal anomaly. The nearest alternative center can schedule only after this week. It would require travel and a later procedure. The delay could exceed that center’s gestational-age limit or change available methods. Later gestation increases risks such as hemorrhage or infection. Hospital counsel confirms either option is legally permissible here. Hospital policy allows conscientious refusal with referral.",
