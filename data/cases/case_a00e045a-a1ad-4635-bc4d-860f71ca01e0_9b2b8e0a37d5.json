      "source_text": "Case 12-3\nAin't Nobody Gonna Cut on My Head\nA 56-year-old farmer, Wilber Williams, accompanied by his wife, Nellie,\nconsulted the Neurology Service of the Veterans Hospital because of memory\ndifficulty. For two years the patient had experienced increasing trouble\nwith the technical aspects of his work. More recently he had been talking\nabout his brother, George, as if he were alive although he had died six\nyears earlier. He identified his own age as 48 and the year as \"1994... er,\nno, 2000.” Examination revealed that the patient walked with a wide-based\ngait, a standard sign of brain pathology, and had a decreased cerebral\nfunction but was otherwise normal. The patient had no difficulty with\nsimple coin problems and could repeat six digits.\nPleading pressing business, the patient declined hospitalization to deter-\nmine the cause of his decreasing cerebral function. His wife tried to persuade\nhim to enter the hospital, but when the physician suggested that she might\nassume guardianship of her husband through court action, she declined.\nSix months later, the patient’s condition had worsened. Through the\nurging of the county agent, the patient had leased most of his farmland to\nhis neighbors and now did no farm work. His gait had become so wide-\nbased that acquaintances mistakenly thought him inebriated. He urinated\nin his pants about once a week but seemed not to care. He sat watching\ntelevision all day but paid no attention to the program content.\nA medical examination showed an apparently alert man without\nspeech difficulty but with considerable mental deterioration. This time the\npatient gave his age as 38, the year as 1973, the president as Clinton, and\nthe location as a drugstore in his home town. He failed to recognize the\nname George W. Bush, but upon hearing the name Dick Cheney, he sponta-\nneously volunteered an opinion on the war in Iraq. The patient could not\nsubtract 20 cents from a dollar but could name the number of nickels in a\nquarter. He could recite the months of the year and could, upon request\nfrom his wife, give fairly long quotations from the Bible.\nThe resident and the attending physician urged hospitalization. They\ntold the patient that they could evaluate him for treatable causes of\nmental deterioration and memory deficit. In view of his wide-based gait\nand urinary incontinence in association with dementia, it was likely he\nhad occult hydrocephalus. It was explained to the couple that this disorder\ncauses decreased mental abilities by interference with the absorption of\ncerebrospinal fluid. The mental deterioration in such patients is partially\nreversible, as in his case at the present time, or completely reversible, as\nwas his case six months ago when first seen. The treatment was to place a\nplastic tube through the skull to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the\nbrain to the vascular system, which was explained to the patient with dia-\ngrams. The patient immediately rejected the operation, summarizing his\nthoughts with the words, “Ain't nobody gonna cut on my head.”\nThe patient's wife again attempted to persuade the patient to accept\nhospitalization and, if tests confirmed the clinical impression, an opera-\ntion. The attending physician argued to the wife that the patient did not\nhave the mental competence to decide his own fate and that the wife should\nbecome the patient's legal guardian through court action and force his\nhospitalization. The wife politely but vigorously rejected this course of\naction, pointing out that, in her family, the husband made all important\ndecisions. In addition, she expressed horror at forcing this kind of invasive\nprocedure on her husband.\nThe resident and the attending physician differed in opinions at this\npoint. The resident thought the patient should be followed in the outpatient\nclinic until he perhaps changed his mind. The resident pointed out that\nthough the patient had decreased mental abilities, he still retained enough\nintelligence to decide his own fate. The attending physician wished for\ncourt action to make the patient the ward of one of his relatives or, if neces-\nsary, the temporary ward of the hospital and forcing hospitalization and\ntherapy.",

        "vignette": "A 56-year-old man is seen in neurology for two years of worsening memory, wide-based gait, and new urinary urgency with incontinence. MRI shows ventriculomegaly with significant chronic white-matter disease. Improvement from testing and shunting is possible but uncertain, though neurology believes confirmed NPH could yield meaningful gait and continence improvement. He can explain the purpose and risks of a shunt in his own words. He gives a stable reason for refusal, citing a longstanding aversion to implanted devices, but he is intermittently disoriented and cannot describe how refusal affects his fall and driving risks. He refuses any lumbar puncture or admission in any setting. The only local diagnostic option is an inpatient lumbar drain trial with one waitlist-allocated slot this week; using it would displace another patient. His spouse is the usual surrogate but declines to consent against his stated wishes. Involuntary admission could require restraints or sedation and may trigger delirium and lasting loss of trust. Honoring refusal is expected to forgo potential NPH benefit and leaves foreseeable near-term safety risks despite supports. Hospital counsel confirms that either course is legally permissible.",
