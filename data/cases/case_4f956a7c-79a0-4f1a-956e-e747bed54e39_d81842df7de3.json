      "source_text": "CASE 30:\nREFUSAL OF TREATMENT\nYou are a GP doing an evening shift for the local out-of-hours provider. A call comes through\nfrom a paramedic requesting an urgent home visit for a 76-year-old man whose wife has\ncalled 999 as he was complaining of chest pain. The paramedic is concerned that the patient\nis having a heart attack but is refusing to be taken to hospital.\nOn arrival at the patient’s house you find that Harry Barker, the patient, is looking very\nunwell. He is pale and slightly clammy. However, his chest pain has eased a little bit with the\naspirin and GTN spray that the paramedics have administered. An electrocardiogram (ECG)\ntaken by the paramedics demonstrates T wave inversion in leads II, III and aVF, suggesting\nan element of inferior ischaemia. You agree with the paramedics that Harry’s chest pain is\nmost likely cardiac in origin and feel he needs an urgent admission to hospital. Although\nHarry had been completely concordant with investigations and treatment up until this time,\nhe now completely refuses to be transferred to hospital.\nYou ask him more questions about his past medical history and discover that other than\nbeing on medication for hypertension and high cholesterol he has been very well. His father\ndied of a heart attack in his 60s but all his siblings are alive and well. There is no history of\ndementia or mental health problems.\nQuestions\n• Can a competent patient refuse life-sustaining treatment?\n• Can Harry refuse to be taken to hospital?\n• What else should be done in the above scenario?",

His pain has eased and his blood pressure and oxygen saturation are stable. The prehospital ECG shows nonspecific ST–T changes with borderline inferior changes that do not meet STEMI criteria. Acute coronary syndrome remains possible. At home there is no troponin testing, telemetry, or access to reperfusion. Delay in transfer could allow recurrent ischemia, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, or death within hours. He refuses hospital transfer. He recalls a prior ICU delirium episode with physical restraint and says he will not be taken against his will. When calm, he can explain the risks and the proposed hospital evaluation. When anxious, he becomes tangential and cannot reliably restate the plan. His wife pleads for transfer. You have tried reassurance and negotiation without success. The ambulance crew must leave now to remain available, and hospital policy permits either honoring a borderline refusal or authorizing conveyance when capacity is uncertain. Forced conveyance may require restraint or sedation given his agitation and prior trauma.",
