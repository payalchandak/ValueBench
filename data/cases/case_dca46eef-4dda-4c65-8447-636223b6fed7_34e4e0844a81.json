      "source_text": "The case of Anna\nSix and a half years ago I met a woman called Anna for\nthe last time. Anna asked me to tell her story when-\never I could, and I often have since that time. She was\na woman in her thirties who was tetraplegic as the\nresult of a road tra c accident some years previously.\nShe also su ered di use phantom pain, which\nrequired constant administration of high doses of\nanalgesic to make it bearable.\nAnna was married and had three young children. She\nhad previously been a very active person – she had\nloved hiking and was an amateur singer of consider-\nable talent. She also enjoyed amateur dramatics. By\nprofession she was a schoolteacher. Now she felt she\nno longer had a life to live, that she was no longer the –\nperson she had been, and she wished to die.\nAlthough she had made it clear that she wished no\nresuscitation, she had suffered a respiratory arrest\nwhile away from her usual carers, had been resusci-\ntated, and was now respirator dependent. After some\nmonths of discussion and the seeking of legal and\nethical opinion, it had been agreed that her request\nto disconnect the respirator could be agreed to.\nA device was fixed up that enabled her to switch off\nthe machine, and three days after our conversation, at\na pre-arranged time and with all her family present,\nshe flipped the switch. Drugs were administered to\nalleviate any respiratory distress and she lapsed into\nunconsciousness. However, a short time later she\n‘ ’\nwoke up and asked angrily, Why am I still here?\nMore medication was given and she relapsed once\nmore into an unconscious state. It was some hours\nlater before eventually her breathing ceased entirely\nand she died.\n(Campbell, 1998, pp. 83 4)",

        "vignette": "A woman in her 30s has chronic tetraplegia after a motor vehicle crash. She has severe neuropathic pain that requires high-dose opioids and sedating adjuvants. Weeks ago she had an unexpected respiratory arrest while away from her usual caregivers. She was resuscitated and now lives with a tracheostomy and full-time ventilator support. She communicates clearly with eye-gaze technology and repeatedly asks for the ventilator to be withdrawn, saying the life she has now is intolerable. Her spouse wants the team to “do everything,” and worries her pain and medications are driving this request. Psychiatry finds no psychosis but notes profound demoralization; capacity is borderline but could likely be clarified with more time. The ventilator service will exchange her trach and renew home-vent orders tomorrow, requiring a definitive plan.
