      "source_text": "Case 6-3\nReaddicting a Heroin User: Are Prisoners Free\nto Consent to Research?\nForty-eight-year-old Harry Henning was in the fifth year of a twenty-year\nsentence in the state prison for a third offense of possession of heroin and\nattempting to sell.\nHe had been convicted within a few years of completing college. Since\nentering the prison he had been drug free, but often recalled the “rush” of\nhis drug of choice. The state prison was notoriously overcrowded, with\nthree prisoners per cell and limited time for exercise or recreation.\nMarc Turner, MD, was a research pharmacologist who had devoted his\ncareer to problems of addiction. For the past five years he had been doing\nresearch on a new agent that was a specific heroin receptor cell blocker.\nThe drug, which could be administered by an implant, was designed to\nprovide long-term blocking of the effects of heroin. It had been tested in\nmice and in three other species of animals and was now ready for initial\ntrials in humans.\nDr. Turner turned to the state prison to find research subjects for a\nphase-one trial of his new compound. On the basis of animal studies, he\nhad good reason to believe it would be safe in humans and effective in\nblocking the addiction response by interfering with the site at which heroin\nbinds in the brain. He proposed to recruit former heroin addicts, administer\nthe implant, and then administer heroin to study the response.\nState laws permitted the use of certain. pin cee for-research i titeill ditttyent thin whet pHeonees aul Saar anys Gua ployment. Dr. Turner realized that if his study went as planned, the subjects would experience none of the traditional pleasures of heroin. Nevertheless, in case the drug did not work as hoped, he wanted to make the initial trial of the drug on persons whose environment would be tightly controlled for several years. Furthermore, he needed to control the environment of the subjects during the research period.\nIn order to provide this control, he proposed to do the research on pris-\noners with long enough sentences that they would have time to recover\nshould something go wrong with the experiment. To provide adequate con-\ntrol of the environment during the research, he proposed to move the pris-\noner subjects to the hospital ward of the prison where the prisoner would\nbe placed in a private room with bath. Each prison hospital room had a TV\nand easy chair as well as a t hospital bed.\nWhen Harry Henning saw the notice recruiting subjects, he figured he\nwas an ideal candidate. He had had his life destroyed by his uncontrolla-\nble addiction and would like to make a contribution to society to prevent\nsimilar problems with others in the future. The private room was also ap-\npealing. Should the institutional review board responsible for approving research in the prison permit prisoners such as Mr. Henning to volunteer for this research? If so, can a prisoner in this environment give an adequately free and informed consent?",

He has declined buprenorphine and methadone because of prior intolerable side effects. An academic center is recruiting prisoners for an IRB-approved, first-in-human implant intended to block opioid effects and possibly reduce post-release relapse and overdose risk. The protocol requires a single controlled opioid challenge with short-acting hydromorphone in a monitored research unit with resuscitation staff, but respiratory depression and renewed cravings remain possible. He would return to his usual housing afterward, and you worry that re-exposure could intensify cravings in a setting with limited supports. Unknown implant harms include serious adverse events that may not yet be predictable. He can withdraw at any time without changes in parole, privileges, or medical access. An independent prisoner advocate will conduct the consent process, and he demonstrates decision-making capacity. If you refuse, he says he will stop seeking care and has mentioned feeling hopeless, though he denies current suicidal intent. Regardless of enrollment, prison policy allows mental health follow-up and non-opioid craving supports. Prison policy requires your medical eligibility sign-off, and only a small number of implant slots remain. Enrollment closes tomorrow.",
