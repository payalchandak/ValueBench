He was diagnosed\nwith type 1 diabetes at the age of 24, which led to chronic kidney disease. Abdul’s kidney\nfunction has deteriorated rapidly over the past several years, leaving him with end-stage\nrenal disease. Six months ago he started dialysis treatment three times a week. Each session\nwould last more than 4 hours, leaving Abdul feeling exhausted and drained.\nAbdul’s condition and medical treatment has impacted his work life; he can now only work\npart-time due to his regular hospital dialysis appointments and fatigue. This has implications\non the family’s financial situation, as his income is greatly reduced. Furthermore, he is spend-\ning less time with his children due to the hospital appointments and constant exhaustion.\nAt his last renal appointment, the topic of kidney transplantation was discussed, however,\nthe waiting list of around 3 years worried Abdul. When discussing this appointment with\nhis family, his brother, Farhan, became concerned as to how his brother would cope with\n3 more years of dialysis and part-time work. A week later, Farhan told Abdul that he wanted\nto donate a kidney to him.\nQuestions\n• What is the Human Tissue Act 2004?\n• How can consent be obtained for organ transplantation?\n• How is organ transplantation governed?\n• What are the different types of organ donation?",

At a clinic visit, he is told the usual wait for a deceased-donor kidney is years. His older brother offers to donate a kidney and has started asking for testing.

        "vignette": "A 41-year-old man with type 1 diabetes has ESKD and has received in-center hemodialysis three times weekly for six months. Dialysis provides adequate clearance and volume control, but he reports marked post-dialysis fatigue and reduced ability to work and participate in usual activities. His arteriovenous access has had recurrent dysfunction requiring interventions; it is currently usable but at ongoing risk of thrombosis or infection. He is listed for a deceased-donor kidney, but the wait is often long and unpredictable. His older brother offered to donate and has no clear medical contraindications. In separate visits, the brother reports anxiety, describes subtle family pressure, and asks to slow the evaluation so he can decide freely. The donor advocate finds him acceptable but remains uneasy about coercion. The center has one accelerated evaluation slot before the brother’s work leave ends; using it would compress psychosocial counseling and decision time. A timely living-donor transplant would markedly improve the patient’s survival and quality of life compared with another year on dialysis, which increases hospitalization and access-complication risk. The accelerated slot is scarce, and using it would displace other pairs waiting under policy-defined urgency criteria. Hospital policy permits either approach after standard consent.",
