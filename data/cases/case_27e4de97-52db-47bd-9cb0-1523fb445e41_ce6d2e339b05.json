      "source_text": "CASE 76:\nDO NOT ATTEMPT CARDIOPULMONARY\nRESUSCITATION ORDERS\nYou are a GP with care of a nursing home. Since your last visit Tim has arrived. He is 87 and\nvery frail. He has a history of ischaemic heart disease but this is well controlled following\ncardiac stenting. He also has early signs of vascular dementia but can still interact with his\nenvironment. Following local clinical commissioning group (CCG) guidance the nursing\nhome has a policy that end-of-life decisions are discussed with patients and their relatives\nonce they have been given a chance to settle in. Part of this involves asking the resident about\nhis wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nGiven the medical situation, you believe Tim should not be for resuscitation because the\nharms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are significant for a person in his physical\ncondition (it is likely that his ribs may break with compressions) and, even if successful at\nrestarting his heart, it is likely that this will only prolong his life by a few months given his\npast history. The nursing home manager informs you that Tim has an extensive family and at\nleast one member visits him daily.\nDuring one of your weekly visits you decide to chat with Tim about his end-of-life wishes.\nHis grandson is also present. Tim does not recognise you from your previous visits, but Dave,\nTim’s grandson, tells you that he seems very settled in the nursing home. His grandfather\nloves to have visits from his family, ‘even though he doesn’t really know who we are’ and\nhe takes great pleasure from the small things in his life, like sitting in the sun in a comfy\narmchair with a cup of tea.\nQuestions\n• Who makes a decision whether to make a Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary\nResuscitation (DNACPR) order?\n• Does this need to be discussed with the patient/the patient’s family/carers?\n• What if the family objects to the DNACPR?",

Tim says, clearly and repeatedly, that he wants “everything done” if his heart stops.

        "vignette": "You are the GP for a nursing facility. An 87-year-old new resident has advanced frailty with limited physiologic reserve. He has stable ischaemic heart disease with prior coronary stents and early vascular dementia with fluctuating orientation. He still enjoys family visits and states consistent general preferences, but he cannot reliably recall or compare information for several minutes at a time. After a plain-language discussion of CPR and hospital escalation, you judge that he lacks decision-making capacity for code status today. He has no advance directive, so his family is acting as surrogate. Facility policy requires either “Full Code” or “DNACPR” to be entered in the chart by the end of the week, and the next formal capacity or ethics review is weeks away. CPR in someone this frail is unlikely to restore meaningful function and often causes chest injuries and prolonged ventilation. Arrests here are often witnessed and an AED is immediately available, so short-term survival is possible. A Full Code order triggers ambulance transfer and ICU triage, and local critical care capacity is strained. Hospital counsel confirms both approaches are legally permissible here.",
