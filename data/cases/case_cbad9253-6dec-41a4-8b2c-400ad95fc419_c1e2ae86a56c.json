      "source_text": "The case of Olle\nOlle is 84 years old and suffers from Parkinson’s disease. In addition to this he has poor vision and hearing. Olle has lived in a residential home for several years but he is not happy there. One particular source of discontent is his love of good food and consequent dissatisfaction with the meals provided at the home.\nThe problem for the staff and for other residents, however, is that Olle has an electric wheelchair which he drives around in, occasionally going too fast to be safe. The other residents have complained about this, saying that they find it frightening, and the atmosphere in the home has become tense and irritable as a consequence. Some of the staff and some of the other residents feel that Olle should have his electric wheelchair replaced with an ordinary one because he is a danger to the safety of others.\nBut this would mean that Olle would become dependent upon the staff for mobility as he is not able to propel himself in a manual wheelchair. The electric chair provides him with freedom.",

Staff report he often accelerates unexpectedly and does not reliably respond to shouted warnings. He understands that someone could be seriously injured, but he insists the chair is “the only thing that still feels like my life.” The facility asks you, his treating physician, to document a plan today because they will implement changes before the next shift.
