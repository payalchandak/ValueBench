      "source_text": "Case 8-6\nIncompetent Colleagues and Basic Patient Assessment\nMary Jo Orlando, RN, believed that careful inspection of the skin was one of\nthe most important parts of patient assessment. She was well aware that\nmost of the patients on the post-critical care unit where she worked were at\nhigh risk for skin impairment because they were elderly and often dehy-\ndrated and malnourished in addition to other chronic health problems. As\npart of each admission, the nursés on all of the units in the hospital were\nrequired to inspect newly admitted patients from head to toe to determine\nthe general condition of the skin. This inspection included assessment of the\nskin over bony prominences such as the sacrum, trochanters, and even\nthe elbows and heels. Needless to say, this part of the overall patient assess-\nment took time and often the involvement of more than one nurse since many\nof the patients were unable to stand or roll over in the bed without assis-\ntance. For the past month, Ms. Orlando suspected that a new nurse on the\nfloor, Nancy Hess, RN, didn't share her view about the importance of good\nskin assessment. One reason for her suspicion was that Ms. Hess never\nasked for help during her assessments of new patients. Another reason that\nMs. Orlando thinks Ms. Hess is just filling in the computer form and not really\nchecking her patients’ skin condition is that, when she works on the evening\nshift and takes care of Ms. Hess's patients, she found skin problems with\npatients that Ms. Hess hadn't documented on the admission assessment.\nSkin problems can develop relatively quickly, but it is highly unlikely that\nthey developed within a single shift. Ms. Orlando tried to be subtle and help-\nful to Ms. Hess by pointing out high-risk patients and offering to help with the\nskin assessment, yet Ms. Hess never asked for Ms. Orlando's or anyone else's\nhelp. Ms. Orlando spoke to the head nurse on the unit to share her concerns,\nand that seemed to result in some improvement for a short time, but then\nMs. Hess returned to her previous behavior. Ms. Orlando believes that\nMs. Hess's treatment of patients in this regard is substandard and poten-\ntially dangerous for this vulnerable population of patients.",

On rounds this morning you find a new, nonblanching erythematous area over his sacrum that could be an early pressure injury or moisture-associated dermatitis, and its timing is uncertain. A unit standard calls for a two-person skin check on transfer when feasible, but staffing has been strained. A nursing facility transfer is scheduled for tomorrow, so today’s documentation and prevention plan will guide his next team. Submitting an internal safety report today typically takes enough time that bedside measures may be delayed during a busy shift. If the area worsens before discharge, he could leave with a higher-stage injury. If you handle it only through bedside coaching, the finding may be underemphasized in handoff and remain uncounted in unit pressure-injury tracking that drives quality improvement and staffing decisions. Risk management confirms either pathway is permitted and nonpunitive here. Because the manager-review queue closes this afternoon, you can initiate only one pathway today.",
