      "source_text": "Case\n11-6\nUsing\nGenes\nto Treat Brain Cancer\nA California woman, whose name has been kept confidential, was suffering\nfrom a glioblastoma, a fatal, rapidly growing form of brain cancer. She had\nhad two previous brain operations, the most recent of which involved the\nremoval of her entire right temporal lobe. She had also undergone three\nrounds of chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and an experimental mono-\nclonal antibody treatment. All failed to improve her situation. Her doctors\ngave her just weeks to live.\nDr. Ivor Royston of the San Diego Regional Cancer Center asked the NIH\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee for a “compassionate waiver” that\nwould allow him to treat this woman with an unapproved, experimental gene\ntherapy. A compassionate use waiver would permit the use of an experimen-\ntal agent outside the normal research protocol and approval process.\nDr. Royston's plan was to inject the woman with her own cells altered\ngenetically to contain interleukin 2 in an attempt to stimulate the woman's\nimmune response to the cancer. This would require that the woman be in-\njected with the cells in progressively larger doses every two weeks.\nAt the time of the proposal to treat this woman, the United States gov-\nernment had a Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which had to\nreview and approve all therapeutic use of gene therapy involving recombi-\nnation of genetic DNA. It had not reviewed this procedure.\nRoyston and the woman's husband had obtained a review from the Food\nand Drug Administration. It concluded that the therapy was, in all likeli-\nhood, not harmful. There was, however, no evidence that the therapy would\nbe effective. It had not been proven effective on animals and had never\nbefore been attempted in humans. :\nIn an ideal world in which a patient had time to wait for the orderly de-\nvelopment of a new drug or biological product, a patient would wait for test-\ning in nonhuman animals as well as humans. This woman did not have that\ntime to wait.\nDr. Bernadine Healy, then the Director of the National Institutes of\nHealth, had the authority to make the final decision. She originally rejected\nthe request.\nThen Senator Tom Harkin of lowa requested that the NIH create a\nsystem whereby the RAC could expedite compassionate use hearings for\npatients dying of terminal diseases. Senator Harkin wrote to Healy request-\ning that she create guidelines for expedited hearings in special cases.\nDr. Healy denied Senator Harkin’s request, stating that there was simply\nnot enough information available on this therapy to justify its use, even as\na compassionate exemption. She also stated that since many patients would\nqualify for this consideration, it would be impossible to decide which should\nbe granted waivers. Healy later reversed her decision citing the woman’s\nshort life expectancy.\nThis reversal prompted much speculation and anger among members\nof the RAC who were not consulted before Healy ultimately granted the\nexemption. Members of the RAC expressed concern that such a precedent,\ninvolving the premature use of experimental therapies, was potentially\ndangerous. The Committee members speculated about Senator Harkin’'s\nrole in the decision, noting that he heads the Senate subcommittee on ap-\npropriations, which allocates funds for the NIH. Harkin was initially made\naware of the woman's plight by her husband, whose sister had worked on\nHarkin's successful senatorial campaign.",

Her mental status fluctuates, but today she demonstrates decision-making capacity and requests a gene-modified autologous immune-cell therapy available only through single-patient expanded access. A closely related cell platform has limited early safety experience in other cancers, but there are no efficacy data in glioblastoma. Treatment would require leukapheresis, complex manufacturing, frequent visits, and inpatient monitoring after dosing. The program has only one manufacturing slot and limited ICU capacity this month, and the hospital would absorb major unreimbursed costs under expanded access. The therapy could trigger severe neuroinflammation, neurologic worsening, and prolonged hospitalization, potentially limiting time at home. She is not eligible for clinical trials or additional standard tumor-directed options locally. If you decline, care would shift to symptom-focused management with steroids, antiseizure medications, and home hospice. The expanded-access committee needs your decision today while she can still consent.",
