She is also increasingly exhausted because\nshe is no longer getting the respite she needs.\nMissing the company of the day-care centre\nhas made Mr D morose and irritable, increasing the\ntensions at home. He has also become increasingly\n‘\nobsessive, muttering that he never has any time any\n’\nmore and complaining that his work burdens seem to\ngrow and grow. He desperately needs more time at the\noffice, he says angrily, and blames his wife for being\nunable to drive, so that she cannot take him to work.\nThe ambulance staff have suggested to Mrs D that\nshe could tell her husband that the van is a taxi,\ncalling to take him to work. They are sure that the\nstaff at the centre will go along with the fiction that\n’\nthis is Mr D s new office. These little deceptions hap-\npen all the time with patients like Mr D, they reassure\nher: sometimes patients are given medications in\nsecret at the day-care centre, for example. Somehow\n’\nMrs D doesn t actually find this terribly reassuring.\n(Based on a case in Hope and Oppenheimer, 1996)\nThe Case of Mr D\nSixty-eight-year-old Mr D, who has moderate deme-\nntia of the Alzheimer’s type, lives at home with his\nwife. He is active and fit, which makes him quite\ndemanding for Mrs D to nurse, given that he is also\nprone to wander and to forget where he lives. She\nwelcomes the respite given by his attendance at a\nday-care centre, which he enjoys: he is very sociable.\nLately, however, Mr D has become worried about\ngoing to the day-care centre because he thinks he is\nlosing time off work. He has never really stopped\nbelieving that he is still employed, although his\nincreasing dementia forced him to retire six years\nago. Now he insists that he cannot afford time to\n‘ ’\nrelax because his deadlines at work are too pressing.",
