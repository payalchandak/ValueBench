      "source_text": "CASE 32:\nASSESSMENT OF BEST INTERESTS\nThe family and friends of Alice are very unhappy with her care in a NHS neuro-disability\nunit. Alice is 45 years old, and following viral encephalitis she has been left with severe neu-\nrological impairment with no prospect of improvement. She cannot move or speak and is\nentirely dependent on others for care. She is receiving clinically assisted nutrition and hydra-\ntion. Alice was close to her father and sister and long-term partner. She does not have chil-\ndren. Her family considers that she would not wish to carry on living in this condition and\nthat feeding should be withheld so she can die peacefully and with dignity.\nPaul is 42. He has a severe learning disability and end-stage renal failure secondary to dia-\nbetes. Unless he receives an organ transplant, his life expectancy is significantly reduced. He\nrequires dialysis three times a week. He has a needle phobia and due to his learning disabili-\nties becomes physically aggressive and resists attempts by doctors to examine or treat him.\nIn order to carry out dialysis, he would require sedation by general anesthetic, which carries\ninherent risks. His understanding of the situation is very limited.\nFelicity is 55 years old and has a severe learning disability. She has localised cancer of the\nuterus and her gynaecologist considers that without a hysterectomy the tumour will likely\nmetastasise and lead ultimately to her death.\nQuestions\n• What factors should be considered in assessing the ‘best interests’ of an incompetent\nadult patient?\n• Who makes the decision about the patient’s best interests?\n• What if the clinical team and the patient’s relatives disagree about what treatment is\nin the patient’s best interests?\n• Is it always in the patient’s best interests to do what the patient would most probably\nhave wanted if he had capacity?",

        "vignette": "A 42-year-old man with severe intellectual disability has end-stage kidney failure from diabetes and receives outpatient hemodialysis. He has intense procedure-related fear and repeatedly resists cannulation. This creates risk of inadvertent injury to him and staff. After supported communication and repeated capacity assessments, he lacks decision-making capacity for dialysis. There are no documented prior wishes about dialysis. His repeated physical refusal is treated as meaningful dissent. Nonpharmacologic approaches and mild anxiolysis have not allowed safe access. Peritoneal dialysis is not feasible because he cannot keep a catheter safe at home. A tunneled hemodialysis catheter is judged likely to be dislodged. Dialysis can continue only if anesthesia provides deep sedation or brief general anesthesia each session. This carries cumulative risks of delirium, aspiration, and reduced quality of life from repeated recovery. Stopping dialysis would likely lead to death in the near term, though symptoms can usually be managed with palliative care. His mother, not formally appointed as guardian, asks that life-prolonging treatment continue. Anesthesia staffing is scarce, and booking these sessions would displace other urgent cases this week. A decision is needed today, and the ethics team cannot meet beforehand.",
