Sophie regularly takes him to meet with other mums from\nher antenatal group. A few of those mothers have said that they are not going to take their children to the GP to have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine because they are\nworried about the side effects. Sophie is concerned to hear this. She and her husband had\nintended to take Alfie for all the routine immunisations because they want to do what is best\nfor him. The mothers’ talk is making Sophie doubt if this is the case.\nQuestions\n• Are childhood immunisations compulsory?\n• Can parents legally refuse to have their child immunised? What if they disagree?\n• Are there any ethical justifications for non-immunisation?",

After his 2‑month routine shots, he developed a high fever and a brief episode of unresponsiveness that led to an overnight hospital stay. He recovered fully and testing found no infection or neurologic disorder. Today he is due for his next set of routine infant immunisations. His parents planned to follow the usual schedule but are now frightened that another reaction could be worse. They are also worried about leaving him unprotected because he will soon start daycare. The vaccines are available in the clinic today, and the next appointment slot is weeks away. Hospital policy and state law allow either giving vaccines now or deferring with documented follow-up.
