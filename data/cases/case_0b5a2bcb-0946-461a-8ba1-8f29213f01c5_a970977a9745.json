The ER physician, Dr. Christopher LeMarke, recognized him im-\nmediately, as did the ER nurses. He had been a regular in the facility,\nhaving visited for his primary medical care and for two previous suicide\nattempts within the past eighteen months. During the previous visits his\nhistory had been explored completely. He was divorced, alienated from his\nadult children, and chronically depressed but was not considered suffi-\nciently impaired that he could be declared incompetent.\nOn the basis of state law, such patients could be held for up to seventy-\ntwo hours on the signature of two physicians if they were deemed danger-\nous to themselves or others. Mr. Perrin had never before engaged in any\nbehavior that would suggest he was dangerous to others, but he surely was\na danger to himself. He had on past admissions received short-term psy-\nchotherapy and prescriptions for antidepressant drugs, but he had stopped\ntaking them because he said they made him feel sleepy.\nHe was now in the ER, incoherent and semiconscious. Should Dr. LeMarke\nsign the involuntary commitment, enlist another physician to sign as well,\nand initiate another round of therapy?",

After initial stabilization he becomes awake and oriented. He says he regrets coming, refuses inpatient psychiatry, and asks to leave as soon as his labs allow. He acknowledges the ingestion was intentional but insists he can “handle it” and will not return for follow-up. He has previously stopped antidepressants because of sedation and distrusts psychiatric care. The team is divided about whether his hopelessness and recent attempt make his decision unreliable despite his apparent understanding. Medical clearance is expected within hours, and the disposition decision must be made before discharge. State law and hospital policy permit either discharge or a short emergency psychiatric hold in this situation.",

        "vignette": "A 55-year-old man is evaluated in the ED after intentional self-poisoning with an anticoagulant rodenticide. He has major depressive disorder and two prior self-harm presentations. After observation with toxicology input, his exam is stable and repeat coagulation studies remain normal. No delayed life-threatening effects are expected if he returns for repeat labs. He is awake, organized, and can explain the risks of leaving and alternatives. He requests discharge and refuses voluntary psychiatric admission. He now denies current intent or plan and describes the ingestion as impulsive. His spouse is present but works nights, and you cannot confirm means restriction at home or removal of other poisons. Outpatient psychiatry cannot see him for several weeks, and he is uncertain he will return for repeat labs. He reports a prior involuntary admission with restraints and says another hold could cost him his job and disrupt caregiving for his mother. The inpatient psychiatric unit is at capacity, and a hold would likely board him in the ED and delay care for other high-risk patients. Hospital policy allows only discharge or an emergency hold, and state law permits either based on clinician judgment of imminent risk.",

I think worth seeing how it plays out ... there will be disagreement i suspect."
