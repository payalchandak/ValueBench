      "source_text": "The Terri Schiavo case\nTerri Schiavo was only 26 when she collapsed at home\nand experienced severe oxygen deprivation (anoxia)\nfor several minutes. She was hospitalized and under-\nwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastro-\nstomy tube (PEG) because she could not swallow. Four\nmonths later, with no amelioration of her condition,\nshe was judged to be in a persistent vegetative state.\nUnder the laws of Flordia, where the Schiavos\nlived, Terri’s husband Michael was appointed her\nlegal guardian, since she was judged incompetent to\ndecide on her own care and had not executed an\nadvance directive. Alongside Terri’s parents, Robert\nand Mary Schindler, Michael worked with the clini-\ncians to try to overcome Terri’s condition by means of\nall available therapies, but after several years there was\nstill no improvement.\nAt this point Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers\nbegan to disagree over what should be done. Michael\nbelieved that Terri’s condition was irreversible\nand that she would not have wanted to be kept alive\nin a persistent vegetative state. Her parents, in con-\ntrast, wanted to maintain her artificial hydration and\nnutrition. The matter was taken to the courts when\nMichael Schindler petitioned for an independent\ndetermination of Mrs Schiavo’s terminal condition’,\nincluding the decision to continue or discontinue life-\nprolonging procedures (cited in Perry et al., 2005,\np. 745).\nBut how firm was the diagnosis of persistent veg-\netative state? Since the case of Tony Bland, a series of\nmuch-publicized examples had appeared to indicate\nthat some minimal degree of function might still be\nretained by certain patients diagnosed as being in PVS\n(Andrews et al., 1996; Bauby, 1997). In reply to a\nsubsequent critic who claimed that Terri Schiavo was\nactually in a ‘locked in state’ rather than true PVS,\nhowever, the bioethicist Art Caplan thundered:\n\nI would like to have him find three neurologists\nwho agree with that claim. Terri Schiavo suffered\nanoxia to her brain twice! Her brain damage was\nconfirmed while she was alive by CAT scan and\nthen at autopsy. She was blind despite the alleged\ntapes that were made showing her tracking\nobjects. Her cortex had shriveled to half its normal\nmass.\n(Caplan, 2009)\n\nIn January 2000 a trial was held to settle the issue of Mrs\nSchiavo’s future, with both sides presenting witnesses.\nThe question, presiding Judge Greer said, was whether\nshe would choose to have her artificial feeding and\nhydration continued if she were competent. Clear evi-\ndence of Mrs Schiavo’s previously expressed wishes was\nadmissible under Florida law, even if only made orally.\nIt was held that the diagnosis of PVS in Mrs\nSchiavo was indeed valid: the court found that she\nmet the statutory definition of the persistent vegetative\nstate and that there was no hope of her regaining\nconsciousness or the ability to communicate (Perry\net al., 2005, p. 746). Given that finding, the next issue\nwas how Mrs Schiavo’s autonomy rights could be\nexercised and what her true wishes would have been\nif she were competent. The trial judge ruled in favour\nof Mr Schiavo, who had produced three witnesses to\naffirm that his wife had previously declared she would\n‘not want to live like that’. The feeding tube was\nordered to be removed.\nRefusing to accept this outcome, the Schindlers\ntook the case to appeal. By this point their daughter\nhad been diagnosed as being in PVS for 10 years. The\nappellate court upheld the ruling of the lower court on\nboth clinical and legal grounds, likewise ordering that\nthe feeding tube should be removed.\nBefore the order could be put into effect, however,\nthe Schindlers presented evidence before a second trial\njudge from other expert witnesses (none of whom had\nactually examined Terri) and succeeded in obtaining a\nfurther evidentiary hearing. They also claimed that\nnew and better medical treatments for brain damage\nhad become available since the initial trial. The case\nwas referred back to Judge Greer, but he again ruled\nthat Mr Schiavo’s experts were more likely to be cor-\nrect and that the supposed new remedies were not\naccepted by the mainstream neurological community\nas having a firm evidence base. On a second appeal in\n2002, Judge Greer’s decision was scrutinized and\nupheld as a cautious legal standard designed to pro-\nmote the value of life (cited in Perry et al., 2005,\np. 746). This was the sequel:\n‘\n– With Terri Schiavo’s personalized decision deter-\nmined at the 2000 trial and her medical condition\nconclusively confirmed at the 2002 hearing, arti-\nficial hydration and nutrition were stopped for\nthe second time, on 15 October 2003, pursuant to\ncourt order. This order was superseded 6 days later\nwhen the Florida legislature passed and Governor\nJeb Bush signed Terri’s Law, which provided the\ngovernor unfettered discretion to order resump-\ntion of Mrs. Schiavo’s medical treatment.\nEleven months later, the Florida Supreme Court\nheld Terri’s Law unconstitutional as a violation of\nseparation of powers, and a third date was set for\nremoval of the PEG tube. On 18 March 2005, the\ntube was removed for the final time, and despite\nthe intervention of Congress and President George\nW. Bush, Terri Schiavo’s saga ended with her death\non 31 March 2005.\n(Perry et al., 2005, p. 748)",
