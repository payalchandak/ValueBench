He did not lose consciousness and now feels “back to normal.” He has glaucoma and significant hearing loss. He renewed his license by mail and has not had a road test in years. Today he drove himself to clinic and says he will keep driving because rides are unreliable and he refuses to “become dependent.” His daughter, who brings him to appointments sometimes, calls you after the visit and asks whether he is safe to drive. You have no formal driving assessment results, but his sensory limitations and recent crash make you uneasy about public safety. A decision is needed now because he plans to drive alone on a long highway trip this weekend. State law and clinic policy allow either reporting concerns to licensing authorities or managing the issue through counseling and referral.",
