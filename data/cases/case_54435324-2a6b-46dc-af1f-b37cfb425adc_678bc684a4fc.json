He is reviewed by your seniors, who tell him he needs an operation to investigate the\ncause of his symptoms. They ask you to obtain consent for laparoscopy and a laparotomy and\nproceed. When you see the patient he is still in pain and he tells you that he is aware he needs\nan operation but just wants them to get on with it. He says he does not want to know what\nrisks there might be, ‘You do whatever is best, doctor’.\nQuestions\n• Why is consent legally necessary?\n• What are the essentials of valid consent?\n• Is consent valid if the patient is not informed of risks because he does not want\nto know?",

He wants to go to theatre immediately. You are the junior doctor asked to obtain consent, and the operating team is ready now.
