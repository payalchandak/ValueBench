      "source_text": "Case 2-]\nExercise, Diet, or Drugs to Control Cholesterol\nJake Mendiola knew he had a problem. He was 37 years old. At 5/10” and\n230 pounds, he was heavier than his doctor liked. His sedentary lifestyle, as\nan information technology specialist at a major accounting firm, meant he\ndid not get the exercise that his wife and his physician thought he should.\nHis physical exams over the past several years showed a nagging increase\nin total cholesterol levels (237 mg/dl); the low-density lipoprotein (LDL; “bad”)\nwas too high, and the good high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was too low. His\nphysician had twice recommended exercise at least three days a week and\nsome dietary modification to get the cholesterol lower. Mr. Mendiola went\npart way. He cut down on eggs for breakfast. He intentionally signed up for\nthe cheaper parking lot at work so he would be forced to walk about three\nblocks to his office. He knew, however, that this was not exactly what his\nphysician had in mind.\nNow at a routine trip to his HMO (health maintenance organization), his\ndoctor nagged him again about diet and exercise. The physician continued\nto worry about the cholesterol, pointing out that the treatment protocol at the\nHMO indicated that diet and exercise should bring the cholesterol into line.\nIf not, Mr. Mendiola was going to have to go on one of the new cholesterol-\nlowering medications called “statins.”\nThe effect on Mr. Mendiola was not what ibe physician had oepeced.\nA question occurred to Mr. Mendiola. He said to himself, “Do you mean I could\nget the same cholesterol reduction by simply taking the pill and still eat\nwhat I have been eating and not sign up for the plan at the local gym?”\nMr. Mendiola considered his options: (1) ask the doctor to put him on a statin\ndrug right now, (2) intentionally avoid the diet and exercise regimen until his\nnext physical exam when the physician would discover that his cholesterol\nwas still too high and, on his own, write the prescription for the statin drug, or\n(3) attempt to follow more faithfully the physician's recommendation about\ndiet and exercise to see if the cholesterol problem will be taken care of. Of\ncourse, there was a fourth option—take his chances and continue with a high-\ncholesterol level, unmedicated and uncontrolled by either diet or exercise.",
