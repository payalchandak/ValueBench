He is dehydrated, breathing rapidly, and labs are consistent with diabetic ketoacidosis. After fluids and an initial insulin infusion, his mental status clears; he is able to describe his condition back to you and says he understands that without ongoing IV insulin, monitoring, and potassium replacement he could deteriorate quickly. He insists on leaving now because he has to pick up his child and fears losing his job if he stays; he refuses admission and asks for “something I can take at home.” As the ED attending, you must decide whether to accept his refusal or to initiate an involuntary hold/override his refusal to keep him for continued treatment and monitoring.",

        "vignette": "A 29-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes presents to the ED with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) after running out of insulin when her insurance lapsed. Initial labs show glucose 520 mg/dL, anion gap 28, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, venous pH 7.12, beta-hydroxybutyrate 6.5 mmol/L, potassium 5.6 mEq/L, and creatinine 1.4 mg/dL. She is started on IV fluids, an insulin infusion, and electrolyte monitoring/repletion. \n\nAfter 5 hours, she says she feels “much better” and repeatedly asks to leave to pick up her child from daycare, stating she will “take insulin at home.” Repeat labs show glucose 260 mg/dL, anion gap 22, bicarbonate 12 mEq/L, potassium 4.1 mEq/L after repletion; she remains on the insulin drip because the acidosis has not resolved. The clinician explains that leaving now with a persistent anion-gap metabolic acidosis carries near-term risks over the next several hours: recurrent vomiting and dehydration, worsening acidosis with confusion, dangerous electrolyte shifts and arrhythmias, and progression to coma or death if insulin is stopped.\n\nA brief bedside capacity assessment is performed. She can sometimes state her diagnosis (“my blood is too acidic from no insulin”) and can list one risk (“I could start throwing up again”), but her understanding and appreciation fluctuate: minutes later she says, “It’s basically fixed because my sugar is down,” and cannot consistently explain why the anion gap matters or paraphrase the clinician’s warning that serious harm could occur tonight. When asked to compare options, she has difficulty reasoning through alternatives and repeatedly returns to, “I have to go—there’s no other way,” despite being told that social work can help contact a family member, arrange a taxi/ride voucher, provide a daycare/employer note, and coordinate same-day access to basal/bolus insulin and supplies through an emergency fill program.\n\nThe ED is currently boarding multiple critically ill patients; ICU beds and nursing resources are strained. Hospital policy allows a time-limited medical incapacity hold if a patient lacks decision-making capacity and faces imminent, serious harm, but emphasizes using the least restrictive alternative and recognizing that coercive holds can be applied inconsistently and may worsen mistrust.",
