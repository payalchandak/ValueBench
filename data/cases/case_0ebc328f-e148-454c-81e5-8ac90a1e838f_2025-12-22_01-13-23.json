Clarify the clinical risk factors and why discharge is still high-risk despite capacity. Quantify/describe ED resource constraints (only monitored bed, impact on other patients) to sharpen justice/triage conflict. Tighten the binary choice language so one option prioritizes autonomy/least restrictive care, and the other prioritizes safety/nonmaleficence and duty to protect."

        "vignette": "A 29-year-old woman with major depressive disorder and PTSD presents to a crowded emergency department (ED) after texting a friend “I can’t do this anymore” and making a superficial cut to her forearm. She was brought in voluntarily by EMS and is now calm, cooperative, and future-oriented at times, but tearful and endorses intermittent suicidal thoughts. She reports a specific plan that “crossed my mind” earlier today (overdose with her roommate’s benzodiazepines) and admits she has access to them at home. She denies current intent, denies hallucinations, and has no intoxication; vitals and labs are unremarkable. She has had two prior suicide attempts (one overdose 3 years ago, one hanging attempt as a teen) and was discharged from an inpatient unit 2 months ago. On evaluation, she demonstrates intact decision-making capacity: she can describe her condition, understands the risks and benefits of options, appreciates how they apply to her, and reasons consistently.\n\nShe explicitly refuses involuntary psychiatric hospitalization, saying inpatient units “make me worse,” she fears losing her job, and she does not want to be “locked up.” She requests instead a crisis-respite placement and intensive outpatient follow-up, and asks for help arranging a safety plan and removal of medications from the home. The on-call psychiatrist estimates her near-term suicide risk as “moderate to high” given recent self-harm, access to means, prior attempts, and recent hospitalization; the team debates whether she meets criteria for an involuntary hold despite intact capacity because of the combination of recent self-harm and access to lethal means.\n\nThe ED is at capacity. There is only one monitored room available that can support continuous 1:1 observation (required for any patient on an involuntary hold), and staffing is limited: assigning a sitter would divert the only available technician from triage. EMS notifies the charge nurse that a patient with unstable chest pain and hypotension is en route and will likely need that monitored room within the next 20–30 minutes. If the suicidal patient remains on a hold in the monitored room, the incoming patient may be boarded in the hallway or experience delayed monitoring and treatment. The team must decide within minutes how to proceed.",
