Her son had the triple measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination just over a year ago after Pippa had been reassured that it was extremely safe and would protect her son against dangerous childhood illnesses. Unfortunately, he had a bad reaction to the injection, with a high temperature, a rash around the injection site and a seizure. Although he seems fine now, Pippa is worried that having a seizure is an indication that he will develop autism or bowel problems. She has read the contradictory evidence about the risks of the triple MMR vaccine in newspapers and recognises that the evidence suggesting a link between MMR and autism has now been disproved. However, she is still concerned about having her daughter immunised against MMR in case the same thing happens to her.\nQuestions\n• What is consequentialism?\n• How can this ethical theory be applied to the case scenario to determine whether or not Pippa should have her daughter immunised?",

Her older brother had MMR last year and developed a high fever, a large local rash, and a brief seizure that led to an emergency visit. He recovered fully. The mother is now frightened the same reaction could happen again and asks if her daughter can avoid the vaccine. The girl has no history of seizures, immunodeficiency, or severe allergies, and her exam is normal today. Measles has been reported in the community, and the child’s daycare will require documentation of MMR or a physician-supported deferral before enrollment next week. The pediatrician must decide how strongly to proceed now versus postponing for further evaluation, knowing that either path carries foreseeable harm. Hospital policy and state regulations allow vaccination today or a documented medical deferral with follow-up.",
