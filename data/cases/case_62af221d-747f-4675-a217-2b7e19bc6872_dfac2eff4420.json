He is awake but pale and confused, with ongoing internal bleeding from abdominal trauma. The trauma surgeon says he will likely die within hours without an operation and blood products. The patient repeatedly refuses surgery, transfusion, and intubation. He says he was recently diagnosed with cancer, declined tumor surgery, and wants to die “on his own terms.” He can state the facts but becomes tearful and intermittently drifts off, and a formal psychiatric evaluation is not immediately available. His daughter arrives and begs the team to treat him, but he tells her to stop interfering. Hospital policy and state law permit either emergency treatment when decisional capacity is lacking or honoring a refusal when capacity is intact. You must decide before he loses consciousness.",
