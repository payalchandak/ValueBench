One of his patients is septic and needs a prescription for intravenous anti-\nbiotics. The consultant tells Joe to put him on ciprofloxacin. However, Joe is aware that the\nhospital protocol has changed and that ciprofloxacin is no longer the first-line antibiotic due\nto the increasing incidence of Clostridium difficile infection after its use. He suggests giv-\ning intravenous co-amoxiclav instead. The consultant agrees and appears impressed that Joe\nis up-to-date with the antibiotic guidelines. Joe prescribes the antibiotic. A few hours later\nhe is called to the ward urgently as the septic patient is having difficulty breathing and has\ndeveloped urticaria. He has had an anaphylactic reaction to co-amoxiclav. Joe realises that\nthe allergies box on the drug chart states that the patient is allergic to penicillin. He puts out\na medical emergency call and after further assessment the patient is transferred to ITU. After\n24 hours on ITU the patient returns to the ward. No permanent damage has occurred.\nQuestions\n• What is clinical negligence?\n• Has Joe been negligent?\n• What can he do to protect himself against a claim in negligence?",

His daughter recalls a remote episode of “hives” after an antibiotic, but is unsure which one. An older protocol used IV ciprofloxacin for severe infections, but it is now discouraged because it is linked to serious antibiotic-associated diarrhea and drives resistance.
