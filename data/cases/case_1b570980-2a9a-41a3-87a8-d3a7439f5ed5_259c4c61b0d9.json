The locum doctor taking over your shift is running late, and you\nare getting a bit stressed as you have a train to catch back to London so that you can make it\nhome in time for your cousin’s birthday party. Just as you are about to leave your bleep goes\noff. A nurse informs you that one of your patients, Eric, is having some chest pain. He was\nadmitted 2 days ago with pneumonia and you suspect that the pain is related to the infection.\nYou ask the nurse to do a set of observations and an electrocardiogram (ECG) and say you\nwill ask the doctor taking over to assess him. You then receive an incoming call. It is your\ncousin, who is very drunk and urging you to hurry up as you are missing out on all the fun.\nYou tell her you are on your way. The locum arrives 20 minutes later and you rush off straight\naway. Later that night you remember that you completely forgot to hand over the patient who\nwas having chest pain. You decide to ring the hospital and find that he is now a patient on the\ncoronary care unit, having had a massive heart attack.\nQuestions\n• Who has a duty of care to this patient?\n• Did you, as the FY1 who received the call, have a duty of care to a patient you have\nnot seen since the onset of new symptoms?\n• Should hospitals have systems in place to ensure that ill patients are handed over to\nnight staff?",

        "vignette": "A 58-year-old man is admitted with improving community-acquired pneumonia. At shift change, the nurse reports brief central chest tightness with nausea that has now eased. His vital signs are stable and oxygenation is unchanged. The ECG is already ordered but will not print for about 10 minutes, and the nurse cannot start the chest-pain protocol without a physician order. He does not meet criteria for a rapid response call. No other doctor is on the ward, and the on-call registrar is reliably expected within 5–10 minutes. You are the outgoing junior doctor. You are markedly fatigued and past duty hours, and you will be hard to reach once you leave. If this is acute coronary syndrome, even a short delay in antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and monitoring could increase the risk of infarct extension, malignant arrhythmia, or death. Activating the protocol would also trigger continuous monitoring and possible transfer. Telemetry beds and transfer capacity are near capacity, so activation would likely consume a scarce resource. The treatment could expose him to harm if symptoms are non-cardiac and assessment is mistaken. Hospital policy and counsel confirm that either immediate initiation or documented deferral with prompt handover is acceptable for a stable patient.",
