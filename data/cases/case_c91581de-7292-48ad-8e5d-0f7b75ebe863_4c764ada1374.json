He repeatedly gets up and enters other residents’ rooms, waking them and sometimes grabbing at bedding. Staff have tried later bedtimes, one-to-one reassurance, music, snacks, and increased evening supervision. A low-dose sedative given with his knowledge has not reliably helped and leaves him groggy in the morning. Tonight, the unit is short-staffed and the pattern is already starting. The nurse asks you, his treating physician for the facility, to give an order now. Hospital counsel has confirmed that either approach is legally permissible with appropriate documentation. You must decide whether to prioritize his expressed refusal of “sleeping pills” and physical restraints, or to authorize a measure likely to keep him in bed and protect the nighttime environment.",

        "vignette": "An 82-year-old man with moderate dementia lives in a nursing home. Most evenings he becomes restless when redirected to bed. He wanders into other residents’ rooms and pulls at bedding. He had an overnight fall and bruising. Redirection, snacks, music, and increased checks have not been enough. Earlier in his dementia, he told staff and his daughter he would accept a low-dose sleep aid if needed but did not want restraints. A prior low-dose evening sedative sometimes calmed him. It left him unsteady the next morning and once worsened confusion. An enclosure bed would reliably stop nighttime wandering and reduce fall risk. It can also provoke panic, worsen agitation, or cause entrapment injury. He cannot explain risks or retain plans, but he repeatedly refuses “sleeping pills” and being “kept in.” His daughter is his health care proxy and is unreachable tonight. The unit is short-staffed and there is no 1:1 sitter or safe wandering area. Policy permits either option with documentation, monitoring, and reassessment. You must enter an order now.",
