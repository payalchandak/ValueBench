      "source_text": "The case of Mr P\nMr P, who is 64 years old, has pre-senile dementia of the Alzheimer s type. His condition is deteriorating rapidly, and for the past four months he has lived in a nursing home. Now he is con ned to a wheelchair and cannot feed himself. His wife Susan comes to visit him every day, bringing a home-cooked evening meal. The nursing home s guidelines for good practice encourage relatives involvement, and Mr P does seem pleased to see Susan when she rst arrives. But although Mr P has a hot meal at lunch time in the nursing home, Susan thinks he also needs a proper meal in the evening, rather than the sandwiches and cakes provided at the home. Mr P appears to resist Susan s attempts to feed him, tossing and turning in his wheelchair. She in turn has taken to playing a little game : holding his nose, so that when he opens his mouth for air, she can spoon-feed him. This seems to make Mr P very agitated, and he is often hard to calm after Susan s visits. The nursing home sta have asked Susan not to feed Mr P, but this has led to worsening relations. They feel that Mr P is clearly indicating that he does not want to be forcibly fed. Susan, very hurt by this comment, insists that she is handling Mr P in a playful but caring fashion, and that she has to do something about Mr P s weight loss, which she blames on inadequate nutrition in the home. 'If you can t even feed him properly, what else are you doing wrong? He s not getting any better, you know.' The nursing sta themselves are divided, some feeling that Susan is trying to help, and others that she is in denial about her husband s impending death. The doctors at the nursing home, however, are unanimous. They see no reason to allow Susan to continue feeding Mr P, as it is contrary to his medical best interests and indeed risks asphyxiation. The manager of the home agrees with the doctors: this unnecessary trouble is upsetting the smooth running of the home, and should be stopped.",

A recent bedside swallow screen suggests dysphagia, and he coughs with thin liquids. His wife visits daily and brings a hot evening meal. He smiles when she arrives, but during feeding he turns his head away, pushes at the spoon, and becomes visibly agitated. She sometimes pinches his nose to make him open his mouth, and staff then struggle to calm him after the visit. Several nurses think her involvement helps him take more food. Others worry the feeding method is causing distress and could lead to choking or aspiration. The physician must set a plan today because the wife has said she will continue feeding at tonight’s visit, and facility policy allows either supervised family feeding or restricting it when safety is at stake.",

        "vignette": "A 64-year-old man with rapidly progressive Alzheimer-type dementia lives in a nursing facility. He is dependent for all feeding and has continued weight loss. A bedside swallow screen suggests dysphagia. A formal speech-language pathology evaluation and instrumental study are unavailable for several weeks. He lacks decision-making capacity. He has no written directive about hand-feeding, but his wife, the legal surrogate, reports he previously wanted family to feed him for comfort and to stop if he showed refusal. His chart emphasizes comfort and no feeding tube. During his wife’s visits, he sometimes accepts slow spoon-feeding and appears calmer and more engaged. Staff report he eats only a few bites with staff and sometimes misses meals on understaffed shifts. At other times he turns his head away or becomes tense, and staff have seen his wife continue repeated prompting before stopping. He has had intermittent coughing and a wet voice during her feeding. Trained staff use positioning and pacing that may reduce aspiration risk. The physician must decide today because she plans to feed him tonight.",
