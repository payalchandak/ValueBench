      "source_text": "Case 9-2\nKaren Quinlan: The Case of Withdrawing a Ventilator\nOn the night of April 15, 1975, friends of 21-year-old Karen Quinlan sum-\nmoned the local police and emergency rescue squad, and she was taken to\nNewton Memorial Hospital. The precise events leading up to her admission\nto Newton Memorial Hospital are unclear. She apparently ceased breath-\ning for at least two fifteen-minute periods. Mouth-to -mouth resuscitation\nwas applied by her friends the first time and by a police respirator the\nsecond time. The exact amount of time she was without spontaneous respi-\nration is unknown.\nUpon her admission to Newton Memorial, urine and blood tests indi-\ncated the presence of quinine, aspirin, and barbiturates in normal range as\nwell as traces of valium and Librium. Dr. Robert Morse, the neurologist in\ncharge of her care, found the drugs to be in the therapeutic range and the\nquinine consistent with mixing in drinks like soda water. The interruption\nin respiration apparently caused anoxia—insufficient supply of oxygen in\nthe blood—resulting in her present condition.\nAt 10 p.m. on April 16, 1975, Dr. Morse again examined Karen. He found\nher in a coma with evidence of what he called decortication indicating an\naltered level of consciousness. She required the respirator for assistance.\nShe did not breathe spontaneously.\nKaren was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of St. Clare’s\nHospital, under the care of Dr. Morse. At the time of her transfer she was\nstill unconscious, still on a respirator, a catheter was inserted into her blad-\nder, and a tracheostomy had been performed.\nDr. Morse testified Karen changed from a sleeping comatose condition\nto a sleep-awake type comatose condition but described this as normal in\ncomatose patients and not any indication of improvement. He indicated that\nduring the awake cycle, she was still unconscious. He claimed that Karen\nwas not brain dead but would not return to a level of cognitive function.\nKaren was examined by several experts for the various parties. All\nagreed she was in a persistent vegetative state. She had irreversible brain\ndamage and no cognitive or cerebral functioning; chances for useful sapi-\nent life or return of discriminative functioning were considered remote.\nKaren's parents, Joseph and Julia Quinlan, assumed responsibility for the\ncare of their daughter. The decision to request that she be removed from the\nrespirator, understandably, came tortuously, arduously to the Quinlans. At\nthe outset, they authorized Dr. Morse to do everything he could to keep her\nalive, believing she would recover. They participated in a constant vigil\nover her with other family members. They were in constant contact with the\ndoctors, particularly Dr. Morse, receiving day-by-day reports concerning\nher prognosis, which, as time passed, became more and more pessimistic\nand more and more discouraging to them.\nMrs. Quinlan and the children were the first to conclude Karen should\nbe removed from the respirator. Mrs. Quinlan, working at the local parish\nchurch, had ongoing talks with Father Trapasso, who supported her conclu-\nsion and indicated that it was a permissible practice within the tenets of\nRoman Catholic teachings.\nMr. Quinlan was slower in making his decision. His hope for recovery\ncontinued despite the disheartening medical reports. Neither his wife nor\nFather Trapasso made any attempt to influence him. A conflict existed be-\ntween letting her natural body functioning control her life and the hope for\nrecovery. Once having made the decision, he sought Father Trapasso’s en-\ncouragement, which he received.\nFather Trapasso based his support of the position taken by the Quin-\nlans on the traditional, moral precepts of the Roman Catholic faith and\nupon a declaration by Pope Pius XII made on November 24, 1957. Father\nTrapasso acknowledges it is not a sinful act under the church teachings or\nthe Papal statement to either continue extraordinary treatment or discon-\ntinue it. It is acknowledged to be a matter left optional to a Roman Catholic\nbeliever. Mr. Quinlan indicates that had Roman Catholic traditions and\nmorals considered it a sin, he would not be seeking termination of the re-\nspiratory support. Mr. Quinlan held that Karen’s natural bodily functions\nshould be allowed to operate free of the respirator. He stated then, if it is\nGod's will to take her, she can go on to life after death.\nThe Quinlans, on July 31, 1975, signed the following statement:\nWe authorize and direct Doctor Morse to discontinue all extraordinary mea-\nsures, including the use of a respirator for our daughter Karen Quinlan.\nWe acknowledge that the above-named physician has thoroughly dis-\ncussed the above with us and that the consequences have been fully ex-\nplained to us. Therefore, we hereby RELEASE from any and all liability the\nabove-named physician, associates and assistants of his choice, Saint\nClare's Hospital and its agents and employees.\nThe Quinlans, upon signing the release, considered the matter de-\ncided. Dr. Morse, however, felt he could not and would not agree to the ces-\nsation of the respirator assistance. He advised the Quinlans prior to the\ntime of their signing the release that he wanted to check into the matter\nfurther before giving his approval. After checking on other medical case\nhistories, he concluded that terminating the respirator would be a substan-\ntial deviation from medical tradition, that it involved ascertaining “quality\nof life,” and that he would not do so.\nKaren Quinlan was quoted as saying she never wanted to be kept\nalive by extraordinary means. The statements attributed to her by her\nmother, sister, and a friend are indicated to have been made essentially in\nrelation to instances where close friends or relatives were terminally ill.\n[Karen's father] urges the Court to act in Karen Quinlan’s best interest\nby authorizing the cessation of the respirator. He asserts Karen Quinlan\nand her family have a constitutional right of privacy that lead to a right of\nself-determination which extends to the decision to terminate “futile use\nof extraordinary medical measures.” He also asserts a constitutional right\nof free exercise of religious belief and freedom from cruel and unusual\npunishment as grounds for granting the sought relief.\nThe doctors and hospital essentially contend, since Karen Quinlan is\nmedically and legally alive, the Court should not authorize termination of\nthe respirator, that to do so would be homicide and an act of euthanasia.\nThe doctors suggest the decision is one more appropriately made by\ndoctors than by a court of law and that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, a decision in favor of the parents would require ascertainment of\nquality-of-life standards to serve as future guidelines.",

She has a tracheostomy and remains fully ventilator-dependent, though she is hemodynamically stable. She opens her eyes and has intermittent nonpurposeful-appearing movements. Serial exams and EEG are documented as persistent vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome, but one consultant notes the bedside exam is imperfect and rare late improvement can occur. She does not meet brain death criteria. She has no written advance directive. Her parents are her legal surrogates. They recall a single conversation after a relative’s death in which she said she would not want “machines” if she were “gone,” but a close friend says she once talked about “fighting” after an injury. The ICU is preparing for PEG placement and long-term facility transfer, and the parents request a decision today before further procedures. An ethics consult has already occurred and left the final decision to you; transfer is not feasible. Hospital policy and state law permit either continuing ventilation or withdrawing it with surrogate consent in this setting.",
