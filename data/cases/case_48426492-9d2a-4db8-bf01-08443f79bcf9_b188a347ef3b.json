It has\n’\nbecome necessary to change Emmi s diet and to\nfeed her only pureed food. Despite this the food still\noften gets caught in her throat. Emmi feels ashamed\nabout this and about the way she appears when\neating in company with the others who live in the\nhome.\nff\nAt a recent sta meeting, one of the workers\nthought it might help if Emmi could be fed in her\nroom. Other workers felt, however, that she should\ncome out and eat with the others, as not to do so\nwould mean isolating herself. It was decided that the\nhead nurse would speak to the other residents. They\n‘ ’\nsaid that they thought it was disgusting when Emmi\nffi\ncoughed at the dinner table and that she had di -\nculties with swallowing. The result of this discussion\nff\nwas that Emmi started to sit o to the side and some-\n’\ntimes even to eat in the nursing home s kitchen. For\npractical reasons, it was not possible for Emmi to eat\nff\nat a di erent time to the other residents. The nurses\nfl\ncannot a ord to spend any more time over meals\nff\nthan they already do as there are not enough sta .\nThe other residents continue to say that they are\ndisgusted by Emmi.\n’ ff\nEmmi s doctor and the nursing home sta are\nfi\nconsidering using a new arti cial and medically assis-\nted type of food provision for Emmi.

        "vignette": "An 85-year-old woman with severe disability after two prior strokes is hospitalized after a new ischemic stroke. She has severe oropharyngeal dysphagia on speech-language evaluation. Even with purees and thickened liquids she coughs, chokes, and takes only small amounts. Oral medications are being missed. Her weight and basic labs suggest worsening hydration and nutrition. Neurology and speech-language pathology expect a low chance of meaningful swallowing recovery in the next few weeks. A gastrostomy tube can be placed during a limited endoscopy block this afternoon; the next slot is weeks away, and she is expected to return to her nursing facility tomorrow. During distressed coughing spells she says “no tubes.” When calmer she asks staff to “help me get stronger,” but she cannot explain what a feeding tube does or what refusing it means, and she forgets discussions within minutes. There is no written directive and no reachable health-care proxy today. Without tube feeding or IV fluids, she is likely to develop worsening dehydration and malnutrition and die within days to weeks. Tube feeding may require restraints or sedation, and aspiration and procedure complications can still occur. Adding her case today would delay another urgent endoscopy. Hospital policy and state law allow either honoring a capable refusal or providing temporary life-sustaining treatment when capacity is lacking and no surrogate is available.",
