Over two weeks, uremic symptoms worsen: severe nausea, confusion, and pruritus develop. His adult daughter asks the hospice physician to restart dialysis to relieve his suffering, stating \"he wouldn't want to feel like this.\" The patient, when lucid, reaffirms he does not want dialysis and accepts that death is near. Restarting dialysis would likely alleviate uremic symptoms but contradicts his expressed wishes to forgo life-prolonging treatment.",
