Neighbours raised concerns\nas she had not taken her milk in for a few days. There is no sign of foul play and she appears\nto have died peacefully in her sleep.\nScenario 2\nDerek is a 54-year-old driving instructor who presents to the surgery with central c rushing\nchest pain. An ECG demonstrates that he is having a heart attack. Whilst waiting for the\nambulance he continues to deteriorate and goes into ventricular tachycardia. Staff begin\nCPR and shock him back into a normal rhythm, but he does not regain consciousness. He is\nintubated at the scene and taken to the nearest intensive care unit. Unfortunately, less than\n24 hours later he suffers another cardiac arrest and doctors are unable to resuscitate him.\nScenario 3\nEvangeline is a 22-year-old ballet dancer who has been involved in a road traffic accident.\nShe is confirmed dead at the scene by the paramedics.\nScenario 4\nMabel has end-stage lung fibrosis. She is seen by her GP due to an exacerbation in her condi-\ntion. He feels she needs hospital admission but Mabel declines. She fully understands that\nrefusing admission is likely to result in her death but she has made a conscious decision to\ndie at home surrounded by her extensive family. They are all in support of her decision. Some\ndays later her daughter rings to inform the GP that Mabel has died.\nQuestions\n• What is the role of the coroner?\n• When should deaths be referred to the coroner?\n• How do you refer to the coroner?",

        "vignette": "A woman in her 70s with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis is seen on an urgent home visit for acute worsening dyspnea. She can only speak in short phrases. Her SpO2 stays low despite her usual home oxygen regimen and nebulizers. She is febrile with a new cough, raising concern for a potentially reversible infection or mucus plugging on top of her chronic disease. Earlier today, while still clearly alert, she said she would accept a short ICU “trial,” including possible intubation, if there were a reversible problem, but she did not want prolonged life support. There is no POLST or written directive. Over the next hour she becomes drowsy and intermittently confused, and you cannot reliably confirm her wishes. Her family requests full life-prolonging treatment if she worsens, and no one is clearly designated as surrogate. Prior pulmonology notes state that if she is intubated, liberation from the ventilator would be unlikely given her baseline disease. The ICU is near capacity and a ventilator would be a scarce resource. If she stays home, she could die within hours to days, and you have limited medications to control severe air hunger.",
