        "vignette": "A 34-year-old patient with newly diagnosed multidrug-resistant tuberculosis attends your outpatient infectious diseases clinic. The patient has been homeless for several years and has inconsistent access to shelter. Standard treatment requires a 9-month regimen of directly observed therapy with second-line agents that have significant toxicities, including ototoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric effects. The patient has previously struggled with adherence to medications and has missed multiple appointments. You could admit the patient to an inpatient facility for the full duration of treatment, which would ensure medication adherence and protect public health by preventing transmission in crowded shelters. However, this extended hospitalization would consume substantial resources equivalent to treating dozens of other patients with serious infections, and the bed would be unavailable for acutely ill patients. Alternatively, you could manage the patient in the outpatient setting with attempted directly observed therapy through community health workers, accepting that adherence will likely be incomplete and that ongoing community transmission is probable. You are the treating infectious diseases physician and must decide on the treatment setting.",
