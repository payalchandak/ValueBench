      "source_text": "Case 7-3\nConfessing an Error in Judgment: Is It Necessary?\nEmilia Hedges is a 68-year-old woman who saw her primary care physician,\nLawrence Aleman, soon after experiencing sudden slurring of speech and\nbrief weakness in the right upper arm. She reported that the episode lasted\nabout thirty minutes, with clearing of all symptoms. Dr. Aleman prescribed\naspirin and asked her to report back if any similar symptoms returned.\nThree days later she was hospitalized with a major left-sided cerebral\nvascular accident (CVA), or stroke. An ultrasound examination of the left\ncarotid artery revealed a 98 percent narrowing (called a “pinpointO”n) t.h e\nneurology service, Ms. Hedges was treated with anticoagulants (blood\nthinners). A month later, an operation was performed to remove the clot\n(a procedure called an endarterectomy). She subsequently was left with\nmarked weakness of the right upper arm and some impairment o¢ fh er\nspeech.\nDr. Aleman was terribly distressed by this outcome. He felt guilta bou!\nmissing the signs of a transient ischemic attack that indicated a ‘severe\nobstruction of blood flow to the left side of the brain, affecting the rightarm\nand the speech center. He realized there were more things he could have\ndone during Ms. Hedges'’s initial visit, such as listening to the carotid arter-\nies with a stethoscope. Hearing a murmur suggesting blockage is clinically\nhelpful, even if it is not definitive. Also, he could have ordered sso me nonin-\nvasive diagnostic tests to narrow the possibilities.\nNow he faces the dilemma of whether he should say something to\nMs. Hedges about the fact that he realizes he could have, probably should\nhave, done more for her. Primary care physicians are frequently placed in\na position in which they are not sure whether they ought to refer a patient\nto a specialist. That comes with the territory of being a general internist or\nprimary care doctor. Dr. Aleman’s question is whether, when he realizes he\nmade the wrong judgment, he should say something to his patient about it\nAt this point there is really nothing that can be done to reverse his error\nin judgment. Telling Ms. Hedges could seriously damage the trust and con-\nfidence that she has in him. It will be an embarrassing and unpleasant\nexperience for him and arguably will not do anything to help Ms. Hedges\ncorrect the effects of Dr. Aleman’s error.",

        "vignette": "A 68-year-old woman presented to her primary care physician with sudden slurring of speech and brief weakness in her right arm that resolved completely within thirty minutes. The physician prescribed aspirin and advised her to return if symptoms recurred. Three days later, she suffered a major stroke with severe residual deficits, including marked arm weakness and speech impairment. Imaging revealed critical narrowing of her carotid artery. The physician now recognizes that during the initial visit, he did not perform a carotid examination or order noninvasive studies that might have identified the high-grade stenosis and prompted urgent intervention. The patient has recovered to her current baseline and continues to see him for ongoing care. Nothing can reverse the outcome at this point, and the patient has not asked whether anything could have been done differently. Disclosing the missed opportunity could significantly harm the therapeutic relationship and cause the patient distress, guilt, or loss of trust, with no prospect of medical benefit. Withholding the information avoids these harms but prevents the patient from making a fully informed decision about her ongoing care and whether to seek accountability.
