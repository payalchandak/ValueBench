      "source_text": "Case 11-1\nStatistical Morality: Prenatal Diagnosis of Colon Cancer\nHarrison Merrik was a 38-year-old man who had been diagnosed with he-\nreditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC). It had taken his father's life\nwhen he was an adolescent. Mr. Merrik had been diagnosed in time to have\nhis colon removed. Now he and his wife, Barbara, age 32, were planning on\nhaving their first child. They had been told by their internist and by a ge-\nnetic counselor that HNPCC results from a genetic mutation that is inher-\nited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This meant that, for anyone who\nhad the mutation, each of his offspring had a 50 percent chance that each\nof his children would also have it. For that reason and because Mr. Merrik\nhad been under medical treatment, he and his wife had hesitated to have\nchildren. They had decided that, if they could not be assured that their chil-\ndren would be free of the mutation causing the cancer, they would remain\nchildless.\nThey were now told that tests with great accuracy could be performed\nthat would tell them if any conception carried the gene. They had two op-\ntions for testing. They could undergo IVF and have the resulting embryos\ntested using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). At about three days\nafter fertilization a single cell would be removed and tested for the pres-\nence of the mutation. At that point, they could choose, from among the em-\nbryos free of the mutation, a number to be implanted. Since not all implanted\nembryos would develop, typically two or three would be implanted hoping\nthat at least one would survive to birth.\nThe Merriks were aware that it was a challenging and expensive\noption. Mrs. Merrik would have to be treated to make egg cells available\nthat could be procured and fertilized with her husband's sperm. The cost\ncould be upward of $25,000 that their insurance would not cover, depend-\ning on the number of cycles involved. They would face the daunting task of\nselecting from the embryos that would be chosen to survive, a task Mrs.\nMerrik thought would be like “playing God.” Remaining healthy embryos\nas well as any with the HNPCC genetic mutation would be discarded\nunless they chose to freeze them for future implantation or to donate them\nto another couple who was infertile or for research. They had moral doubts\nabout all these options.\nTheir second option for having a child that was genetically their own\nwould be to conceive naturally and then have the fetus tested prenatally\nfor the presence of the mutation. They would have to wait for eleven to\ntwelve weeks for testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or at least four-\nteen weeks to have amniocentisis in which amniotic fluid would be with-\ndrawn to have fetal cells recovered and tested. The risk of either CVS or\namniocentesis was a small risk of interrupting the pregnancy (about 1 per-\ncent). They had a 50-50 chance that any offspring would not have the gene.\nIf it did, they could choose abortion if they remained committed to avoiding\nchildren with the gene. This approach would require a more substantial\nmedical procedure—a midterm abortion if amniocentisis were used. It\nwould also raise the moral issues of abortion for a serious but not uniformly\nfatal medical condition. Although discarding embryos after IVF could also\nbe thought of as abortion, some would think of a mid-term abortion\ndifferently.\nAdding to the complexity of their choice was the fact that not all people\nwith the HNPCC mutation would get clinically significant colon cancer.\nAbout 80 percent of persons with the gene eventually develop it. For those\ndeveloping the cancer, death will result without treatment, but removal of\nthe colon and perhaps the rectum could provide a good chance of survival.\nThis could result in the need for a colostomy, but the gene did not mean a\ncertain death from this kind of cancer. The risk for other cancers would\nremain, just as in any other person.\nThey had the additional options of waiting io test the offspring postno-\ntally, perhaps waiting until the child had matured to the point that he or\nshe could decide about when to test, or having a child that was not carry-\ning Mr. Merrik’s genes—either through adoption or artificial insemination.\nWas prenatal testing through PGD or amniocentesis acceptable, and, if so,\nwas one of them morally preferable?",

His 32-year-old spouse is healthy and they want their first child, but they feel unable to parent a child who inherits the mutation. They ask you, their fertility specialist, to help them choose a path that minimizes future suffering. One option is IVF with embryo testing and transfer of embryos without the mutation. This requires ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, and embryo biopsy, and it would likely mean freezing or discarding embryos they will not use. The other option is to conceive naturally and use invasive prenatal testing, with the possibility of a later pregnancy termination if the fetus carries the mutation.

They want a genetically related child and strongly prefer not to have a child who carries the variant. You explain that carriers have a higher lifetime risk of several cancers, but risk and timing are variable and screening and prophylactic surgery can reduce harm.\n\nThey ask about options to reduce transmission. IVF with preimplantation genetic testing could identify an embryo without the variant, but it requires ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, embryo biopsy, may take more than one cycle, and brings financial and emotional strain and small procedural risks. They decline any IVF plan that could involve embryo freezing or discarding, and the lab cannot guarantee a “no-discard” approach during its limited pre-renovation schedule. Natural conception with CVS or amniocentesis is routinely covered and would not use the lab’s last remaining PGT slot, but it only provides fetal information after conception and could create pressure to consider termination if the fetus carries the variant, which they are morally uncertain about. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach. The lab can start IVF only this month.",
