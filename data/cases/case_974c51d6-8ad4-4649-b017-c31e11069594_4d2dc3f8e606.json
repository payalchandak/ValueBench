Over the past day he has developed relentless air hunger with panic and agitation despite maximized standard hospice measures (opioids, non-drug calming strategies, and careful oxygen use). He is now intermittently delirious and cannot participate reliably in complex decisions; there is no advance directive, and his family says they want the team to “do whatever is most appropriate” rather than choosing specific interventions. The hospice physician must decide whether to start continuous palliative sedation with a sedating infusion to keep him deeply asleep so his distress stops, knowing this will likely remove his remaining ability to interact and could worsen breathing, or to avoid continuous sedation and continue only intermittent, lighter medications and supportive care, accepting that he may remain conscious and visibly distressed at times.",

        "vignette": "Mr. Alvarez is a 68-year-old man with end-stage COPD and metastatic lung cancer enrolled in home hospice. Over the past 24 hours he has had worsening dyspnea with panic and agitation. The hospice nurse has already implemented nonpharmacologic measures (upright positioning, fan, pursed-lip breathing coaching, minimizing noise/light stimulation) and optimized intermittent medications per the hospice plan (scheduled low-dose morphine with additional PRN doses; low-dose lorazepam PRN for panic; secretion management). Despite these steps, he continues to have recurrent episodes of severe air hunger and agitation. Full evaluation for reversible causes is limited at home overnight (no immediate labs or imaging; limited ability to assess for new infection, pulmonary embolus, or hypercapnia), and overnight continuous nursing is not available.\n\nTwo days ago, during a clearly lucid hospice visit, Mr. Alvarez told the hospice physician and his daughter (and it is documented in his hospice plan): “If you can, keep me awake enough to talk with everyone tonight and tomorrow morning. I’m okay with medicine for air hunger, but please don’t keep me knocked out unless there’s truly no other way to stop the suffering.”\n\nTonight he is intermittently lucid but currently delirious, gasping, and unable to participate in a meaningful conversation or demonstrate consistent decision-making capacity. His wife, his health care proxy, is distraught and asks the on-call clinician to “put him to sleep continuously tonight so he won’t suffer,” requesting deep continuous sedation at home. The nurse notes that continuous deep sedation would likely eliminate any meaningful interaction if he becomes lucid, and carries risks at home (oversedation with respiratory depression, aspiration, inability to monitor closely). Transfer to an inpatient hospice unit for closer monitoring is possible but would require ambulance transport and leaving home.",
