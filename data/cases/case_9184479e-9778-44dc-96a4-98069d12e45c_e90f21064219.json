The consent form and pre-op discussion were specific to the left ear and did not address operating on the right. After induction of general anesthesia and sterile prep, the surgeon examines both ears under the microscope. The left ear changes appear stable. The right ear has findings concerning for more advanced disease that could be addressed with the same type of procedure today. If untreated, it may progress and could later require a larger operation, but it is not an immediate emergency in the next hours. Changing the operative site now would avoid a second anesthetic and another recovery period. It would also mean performing an unconsented procedure on an unconscious patient.
