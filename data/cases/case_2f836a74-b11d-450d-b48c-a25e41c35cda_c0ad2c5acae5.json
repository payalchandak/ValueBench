        "vignette": "A 78-year-old man with end-stage COPD is admitted to the ICU with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. After three weeks, he remains ventilator-dependent with minimal improvement. He is awake and able to communicate by nodding and writing brief notes. Over several conversations, he consistently expresses that he wants the ventilator withdrawn, stating he is \"tired of fighting\" and does not want to live dependent on machines. His written notes are clear and coherent. The intensivist believes that with a tracheostomy and transfer to a long-term ventilator facility, he has a reasonable chance of eventually weaning from mechanical support over the next several months, potentially regaining enough function to return home with oxygen therapy. The patient refuses the tracheostomy and continues to request extubation, fully understanding this will likely result in his death within hours to days. His adult children are pleading with him to \"keep trying\" and asking the medical team to convince him to accept the tracheostomy. As the attending intensivist, you must decide whether to proceed with extubation as the patient requests or to attempt further persuasion and delay withdrawal in hopes he will accept the potentially beneficial intervention.",
