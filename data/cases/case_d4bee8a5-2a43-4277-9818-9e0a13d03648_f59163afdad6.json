No one else wants to see her. Naomi\nis very subdued and has a deep cut along the top of her thigh. Her legs and arms are criss-\ncrossed with scars. She asks you to just hurry up and ‘practise your suturing’ so that she\ncan get home in time for a family roast. You are concerned about her blasé attitude to her\ninjuries. Looking through the notes you discover this is her 18th attendance to A&E in the\npast 6 months for similar treatment. You try to talk to Naomi about why she self-harms.\nNaomi is surprised, as no one has asked her this before.\nQuestions\n• How should patients who self-harm be managed?\n• What can be done to prevent a ‘revolving door’ system of hospital admissions?",

Her arms and legs show many older scars. The chart shows many similar visits in recent months, with increasing injury severity. She is calm, not intoxicated, and says she is not trying to die. She asks you to “just stitch it” and leave quickly for a family meal. She refuses to speak with the on-call mental health clinician and insists you not call her parent, saying it will “make everything worse.” You worry that sending her home repeats a pattern and misses a chance to address serious distress, but holding her or involving family against her wishes could feel coercive and damage trust. Hospital policy and state law permit either confidential discharge or an emergency psychiatric evaluation for a minor in this situation.

You note healed linear scars, and her chart shows several similar visits over recent months with increasingly deep cuts. She is calm, coherent, and not intoxicated. She denies suicidal thoughts, plan, or intent and denies hallucinations. She says cutting helps when she feels overwhelmed. She wants wound repair only and explicitly refuses a psychiatric evaluation or hospital hold today. She reports strong urges to cut again tonight and cannot commit to staying safe. She fears that notifying her parent will make home life unsafe. She agrees to a safety plan, crisis numbers, and that you may call her aunt to pick her up. She has a therapist visit scheduled in two days. Psychiatry will only evaluate her now if you initiate an emergency hold. This would require security precautions, trigger guardian notification, and may tie up a bed and 1:1 staff for hours. She says she will leave after suturing, so you must decide before starting.",
