The reasoning was that they are outrageously expensive and do not cure the disease, although it may extend survival. The data that they extend survival are not entirely conclusive. In addition, in a private meeting with the medical director, you have been told that the expenditures per patient load of care of each of the physicians would be examined yearly to determine which physician would be promoted.\nWhat do you do?\na. Fully inform the patient about the risks and benefits of bone marrow transplantation.\nb. Refer your patient to an oncologist to have this discussion.\nc.
