He has life-threatening internal bleeding that surgeons believe can be controlled with urgent surgery, but he repeatedly refuses any operation and says he wants to die. He is awake and able to describe the procedure and likely consequences of refusing, and he adds that he recently learned he has cancer and has been declining disease-directed treatment. He is not delirious, but he is acutely distressed and remains actively suicidal. There is no advance directive available, and family cannot be reached in time. The physician must decide how to proceed.",
