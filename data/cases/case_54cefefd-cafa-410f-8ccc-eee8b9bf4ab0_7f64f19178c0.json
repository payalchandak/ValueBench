After two days of maximal antibiotics and fluids, she remains profoundly hypotensive and now has signs of significant hypoxic brain injury. She is disoriented and cannot understand information or participate in decisions. No written advance directive or appointed proxy is available. Her adult children are all present and in full agreement that she repeatedly said she would not want to be kept alive on machines if she could not wake up and interact. The ICU team believes survival would likely require ongoing life support with invasive monitoring and repeated blood draws, with an uncertain neurologic outcome and the possibility of prolonged dying. Hospital policy and state law allow either continued life-sustaining treatment or withdrawal based on consistent family testimony.

After two days of broad-spectrum antibiotics and resuscitation, her lactate is improving but she still needs pressor support and has worsening kidney failure. She opens her eyes to pain but does not follow commands. CT shows a contained perforation that might be operable. The surgeon thinks surgery could control the source, but the risks include perioperative death and prolonged ventilator and dialysis dependence, with an uncertain chance of returning to interactive function. She lacks decision-making capacity. There is no written advance directive or appointed proxy. Her adult children report she opposed long-term dependence on machines, but they cannot relate those statements to a time-limited trial for a potentially reversible illness. If support is withdrawn, she is expected to die in the near term with medications to prevent distress. The ICU and dialysis services are at capacity. Ethics review confirms either course is legally permissible. The team must choose between emergent surgery with full ICU support or comfort-focused withdrawal.",
