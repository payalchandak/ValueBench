Over the past week, Jessica\nhas noticed that her registrar frequently turns up late and has often not shaved. He has a\nreputation for enjoying a good night out and has occasionally turned up with a hangover.\nHowever, Jessica is concerned that there are incidents where he appears drunk and that this\nis beginning to affect his concentration and the level of care he is providing to his patients.\nHe often rushes or neglects his bedside care of patients.\nJessica asks the registrar if he is feeling OK, but he irritably brushes her aside and says that it\nis none of her business. Jessica is unsure what to do next.\nQuestions\n• What is whistleblowing?\n• What are the legal protections for a whistleblower?\n• Does Jessica have a professional duty to report?",

Fixation is scheduled for this afternoon because delaying surgery would prolong immobility and may worsen delirium. In the pre-op area, the orthopaedic attending notices the senior resident assigned to the case is late, unsteady, and has alcohol on his breath. His speech is slightly slurred. He insists he is just exhausted and wants to operate. There is no immediate backup with comparable experience, and removing him will likely delay the case until tomorrow due to operating room scheduling.
