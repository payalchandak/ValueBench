Her temperature is 38.1° C (100.6° F),\nblood pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination shows diffuse discomfort in her abdomen\nthat is increased in the right lower quadrant without guarding or\nrebound tenderness. Pregnancy test, workup for sexually\ntransmitted diseases, and pelvic examination are negative.\nAbdominal and pelvic computed tomography scans show nonspecific\ninflammation in the area of the appendix but are not definitive for\nappendicitis. The patient's condition remains stable with improved\npain control. However, it is recommended that she be admitted to the\nhospital for further observation, with consideration for possible\nexploratory laparotomy in the next 24 hours if she. worsens. This is\ndiscussed with the patient and her boyfriend. The physician inquires\nabout obtaining consent for further medical care. The patient says\nthat she lives with her parents but does not want them called as\n\"they would find out I've been spending time with my boyfriend, and\nthey don't approve of him.\"\nWho is the appropriate person to sign the consent form for admission and\nfurther medical care?\na.

        "vignette": "A 16-year-old girl presents with 12 hours of nausea, vomiting, fever, and right lower quadrant pain. She is stable and her pain improves after fluids and analgesia. Gynecologic causes have been assessed and seem unlikely. CT shows equivocal periappendiceal inflammation. The surgical team says two plans are reasonable: discharge with strict return precautions or admit for serial exams, NPO status, and IV antibiotics, with appendectomy if she worsens. She demonstrates understanding and can describe the risks of both plans. She asks that her parents not be contacted. She says it would cause serious conflict at home, she fears being hit or forced to leave home, and she may leave rather than stay if they are called. She is accompanied by her boyfriend, and there is no concern for coercion. Hospital counsel confirms she can consent under the mature minor standard, but the hospital’s usual policy still requires a guardian for overnight admission and operative anesthesia. The ED cannot board minors overnight, and the surgical service will not accept admission unless consent authority is clarified within the hour. If parents are not contacted, she will likely be discharged despite ongoing appendicitis risk and limited ability to proceed quickly to surgery. If a parent is contacted, she is likely to leave before observation and antibiotics can start.",
