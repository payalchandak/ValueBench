He has a severe learn-\ning disability, and the nursing home provides one-to-one nursing and care support for him.\nAlthough he does wander around the home on occasion, he has never tried to leave the nurs-\ning home, and the nursing home staff report that he seems happy and free of pain and other\ndistress. If he ever did try to leave, staff would prevent him from doing so, to avoid him com-\ning to harm. He seems to enjoy some activities, such as watching television and being read to.\nHe requires assistance with feeding and toileting and is given regular medication by staff at\nthe home. Although he does vocalise, no coherent conversation is possible. He has no family\nand does not receive any visitors.\nQuestions\n• How do the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards relate to both the Mental Health Act\n(1983) and Mental Capacity Act (2005)?\n• What is the difference between a restriction of liberty and deprivation of liberty?\n• Should the nursing home staff apply for an authorisation under the Deprivation of\nLiberty Safeguards?",

He is nonverbal, ambulatory, and lacks capacity for this decision. His care plan notes pacing is his main way to self-soothe, and he eats better after long walks. Over the past week he has tried to leave the unit and twice reached the parking lot; on one occasion he stepped toward the busy road and was pulled back. When staff block the doorway, he becomes distressed, strikes at caregivers, and then refuses food and fluids. He sometimes requires PRN sedatives and has fall risk during struggles. During a prior trial of delayed-egress locks, he settled with fewer PRN sedatives and better intake. The team has tried escorted walks and visual cues, but no additional staffing or technology can be arranged before tomorrow’s safety review. Facility policy and state regulations permit either activating delayed-egress locks with time-limited physician orders and review or keeping doors unlocked with a written supervision plan.",
