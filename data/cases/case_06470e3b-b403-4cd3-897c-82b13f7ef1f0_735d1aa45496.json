Before Mr. Gonzalez's daughter could get to the hospital,\nthe consultant pulmonologist, Melanie Caldarone, administered cardio-\npulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and admitted him to the intensive care unit\n(ICU). Upon Ms. Gonzalez’s arrival at the hospital, she explained that she\ndid not want CPR or other life-sustaining measures based on past commu-\nnication with her father. She showed them a letter from Mr. Gonzalez stat-\ning his concern about a friend who ended up “helpless on machines.” There\nwas no formal advance directive, however, just this one example of\nMr. Gonzalez's worry about his friend. The family physician and consultant\nneurologist had authorized extubation and removal of the respirator in the\nmedical record but did not insist on that course because of the pulmonolo-\ngist's insistence that Mr. Gonzalez was “not brain dead.” He was main-\ntained on support for three days and then expired.\nThe insurance department of the health maintenance organization\n(HMO) funding Mr. Gonzalez‘s hospitalization refused to pay for the ICU\nexpenses because of the family's decision for DNR, charging that the hos-\npital and staff had overused the facilities and nursing staff and for which\nthe HMO accepted no financial responsibility.",

She says she is his closest available surrogate and asks for DNR status and removal of the ventilator today. The neurologist feels meaningful recovery is unlikely but cannot be certain this early. The ICU team notes he is stable on the ventilator and could be observed for a short period before any withdrawal decision.
