      "source_text": "Case 4-3\nPhysician Assistance in an ALS Patient's Suicide\nDr. Jim Witcher was a 57-year-old retired veterinarian who owned a horse\nfarm in Louisiana. He had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, sometimes\ncalled Lou Gehrig’s disease), which was gradually causing him to lose\nmuscle control. He had been active on his farm and enjoyed caring for his\nhorses but was now wheelchair-bound in a power-assisted chair. He could,\nwith assistance, get out on his farm but was losing the ability to feed him-\nself. He worried about his gradual decline and loss of control. He also wor-\nried about the enormous costs that were depleting the resources set aside\nto support him and his wife during their retirement.\nHis wife provided around-the-clock care. She resisted suggestions that\nshe place her husband in a nursing home or even hire help for his care.\nTheir children were grown and occupied, raising their own families.\nDr. Witcher knew the burdens on his wife were enormous.\nDr. Witcher realized that he would soon lose all ability to consume\nfood and medicine unaided and anticipated the day when he would not be\nable to hold his grandchild or even breathe on his own. He knew what he\ndid when one of the horses under his care developed incurable disability.\nOne day during a routine visit with his internist, he raised the question of\nwhy humans could not get similar assistance to quickly end their misery\nwhen their suffering and disability became unbearable.\nHis physician told Dr. Witcher what he already knew. Physician assis-\ntance in suicide was illegal and violated the traditional norms of the physi-\ncian’s medical ethics. His physician pointed out that highly skilled and\ncompassionate hospice care was available that would make his inevitable\ndeterioration as comfortable as possible but that he could not legally or\nethically assist by prescribing or administering a lethal drug.\nDr. Witcher acknowledged that what he desired was illegal but asked\nwhy the law could not be changed.",
