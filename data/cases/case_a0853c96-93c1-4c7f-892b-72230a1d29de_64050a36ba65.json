      "source_text": "Case 6-2\nA Mature 12-Year-Old Who Refuses a Heart Transplant\nTwelve-year-old Emma Ogden had suffered all her life from a congenital\nheart defect that had led to over forty operations during her short life. Still,\nshe was not doing well. She suffered cardiac episodes periodically while\nin school or at play leading to repeated calls to the emergency medical\nservices (EMS) personnel. Up to this point, they had always been able to\nresuscitate her and transport her to the emergency room (ER) where eventu-\nally her condition was stabilized.\nNow Dr. Abdul Hamid, the transplant surgeon at the hospital, had in-\nformed Emma and her parents that her only long-term hope was a heart\ntransplant. The child's condition was so severe that she would not survive\nmuch longer without the operation. Even with a transplant, her prognosis\nwas not good: no more than 10-20 percent chance of five-year survival with\nlikely repeated crises related to her damaged lungs and circulatory\nsystem.\nEmma was a remarkable child. She had recently been conducting\nclass sessions in school trying to help her classmates understand what\nwas happening when she would lose consciousness in school, leading to\nrescue personnel rushing in and her fellow students being evacuated from\nthe classroom until she could be removed. She had written an essay pub-\nlished in their local community newspaper describing her situation. The\nteachers had told her parents that, in spite of her many missed school days\nover the years, she tested three years above her grade level.\nShe had read everything she could find about her condition. She knew\nher chances of survival were not good. She had had about all she could\ntake of hospitals, operations, and medical crises. After considerable\nthought she came to the conclusion that the transplant was not worth it. She\nknew the alternative was certain death in the near future. She had also\ncome to understand that an adult in this position would have the legal right\nto refuse consent for the procedure. She told Dr. Hamid that she did not\nwant the transplant.\nShe had discussed the matter at length with her parents, who had re-\nluctantly come to understand her position. They would support her if that is\nwhat she wanted to do.\nDr. Hamid was taken aback. In all his years of cardiac transplant sur-\ngery, he had never had a case like this one. Occasionally, an elderly patient\nwho was rapidly declining and had been advised that he or she was un-\nlikely to survive heart transplant had accepted his advice and declined the\nextreme procedure, but never before had he been confronted with a refusal\nby a 12-year-old who could potentially survive many years if everything\nworked just right.\nDr. Hamid considered the possibility of getting consent from her par-\nents but realized that they might also refuse. He turned to an ethics com-\nmittee, who explained to him that some adolescent minors were considered\nsufficiently mature that they had the authority to make medical decisions\non their own behalf. (Some pregnant adolescents have consented to abor-\ntion on this basis, for instance.) On the other hand, the committee members\nhad never invoked the mature minor rule on someone as young as 12 and\nfor a decision as momentous as a life-ending transplant refusal. Their al-\nternative was to treat her as other 12-year-olds, some of whom might ex-\npress resistance to needed medical procedures. Parental consent is\nnormally acceptable in such cases. However, since the parents might\nthemselves refuse, his only option would be to seek a court order to oper-\n_ ate against the wishes of both the girl and her parents. Should he accept\nthe girl's refusal, rely on the parents’ judgment, or attempt to get the court\norder?",

The transplant service has deemed her medically eligible, but surgery would be technically difficult. It could require a prolonged ICU course, mechanical support, and lifelong immunosuppression. The team thinks transplant could allow discharge home and years of meaningful survival, but it could also lead to complications and prolonged hospitalization. Without transplant, cardiology expects death within days to weeks despite inotropes and symptom-directed care. She has repeatedly said she does not want a transplant. Child psychiatry finds she cannot consistently demonstrate understanding because her cognition fluctuates with low perfusion and sedating medications. Her parents now agree to follow her refusal but fear she may be traumatized if forced. A donor offer is expected within days, and this center requires a decision today: remain active and accept offers or be delisted entirely. Remaining listed would use a scarce donor heart that could otherwise go to another urgently listed child. Hospital counsel confirms either path is legally permissible here.",
