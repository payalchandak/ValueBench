She says she does not want the test and asks you to “just note that I’m not doing it.” Her adult daughter, who accompanies her, urges you to persuade her. You know that screening at her age can sometimes find an early cancer that is still treatable, but it can also lead to callbacks, biopsies, and treatment for findings that may never have caused problems in her lifetime. The patient says she values avoiding medical interventions and worries she will be “pulled into” procedures once a scan is abnormal. The screening window closes in two weeks, so if she declines now it will be difficult to reschedule soon. Hospital policy and current law allow either an informed refusal or proceeding with screening after counseling.",
