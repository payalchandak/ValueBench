      "source_text": "Case 8-1\nKeeping a Patient Waiting\nFifty-eight-year-old Judy Anderson had accepted the only appointment\navailable with her internist, Anthony Fantaw, a member of one of the adult\ncare teams at a major East Coast HMO. She had been diagnosed a month\nearlier with hypertension (175/95). Dr. Fantaw had prescribed the generic\nfor Microzide (hydrochlorothiazide) and Prinivil (lisinopril) and told her to\nschedule an appointment for follow-up.\nMs. Anderson had been bothered by jitteriness and loss of appetite\nsince taking the medication, so she was eager to discuss these problems\nwith Dr. Fantaw to see if they might be related to her medication. She had\naccepted a 1:30 p.m. appointment, which was the only one available even\nthough she was responsible for picking up her grandson after school at\n3 p.m. Since the HMO placed its physicians on a regimen of ten minutes per\npatient for such routine follow-up appointments, Ms. Anderson figured she\nwould be done in plenty of time.\nMs. Anderson arrived at 1:15 p.mm. She registered, ae her co-payment,\nand took a seat in the waiting room with about ten others. By 1:40 p.m. she had\nnot been called by the nurse and was beginning to get nervous. By 1:50 p.m.\nshe was more uncomfortable since her grandson's school was about a half\nhour away from the HMO offices. No one had said anything to her about the\ndelay so she asked the receptionist what was happening.\nThe receptionist said that Dr. Fantaw had been running behind all\nday, a rather common pattern for him. He had spent twenty-five minutes\nwith a patient that morning who had an unusually complicated set of prob-\nlems. As a clinician deeply committed to high-quality medical care for his\npatients, he often found himself pressured to go a bit over the ten-minute\ntime period. By this point in the afternoon he was running about forty-five\nminutes behind.\nMs. Anderson wondered why the receptionist had not told her all of this\nwhen she registered. She also wondered why, if this was a common pattern\nfor Dr. Fantaw, some action was not taken to address the issue of his regu-\nlar inability to stay on time.",

Her blood pressure in triage is still elevated. She also needs to leave by 3 p.m. to pick up her grandson, and missing pickup would disrupt her caregiving arrangement. The clinic schedules routine follow-ups in 10-minute slots, and you are already running far behind after spending extra time with a medically complex patient earlier.

She reports intermittent jitteriness, reduced appetite, and brief lightheadedness when standing. This morning she had a near-syncope episode without chest pain, dyspnea, or focal neurologic symptoms. Her home blood pressures remain markedly elevated despite treatment. A baseline BMP last week showed low-normal potassium, and a repeat BMP drawn this morning will not result until tomorrow. In clinic she is alert and well appearing. Her exam is normal, and orthostatic vitals do not show a significant drop. She says she may stop the medications unless she gets clear guidance today. She also says she cannot stay past 3 p.m. because of a fixed caregiving pickup. The clinic is overbooked, with patients waiting. Visits are limited to 10 minutes, and extending visits requires supervisor approval and can delay other patients’ care. You must decide whether to use this visit for a full workup and counseling or to send her with an interim plan and rapid follow-up.",
