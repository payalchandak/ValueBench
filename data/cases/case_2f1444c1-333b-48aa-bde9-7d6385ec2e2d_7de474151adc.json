      "source_text": "Case 7-7\nA Psychiatric Patient’s Right to See Her Medical Record\nClaire Mowry was a 38-year-old, single woman who had worked intermit-\ntently over the past ten years as a secretary. She had had difficulty keeping\njobs because she would regularly engage in disputes with fellow employ-\nees, accusing them of not carrying their load of the office work, criticizing\ntheir work, and in one case reporting a fellow worker to the supervisor for\nconsistently showing up late for work.\nCurrently out of work, she was seeing Martin Gaskell, a psychiatrist\nworking with the mental health clinic of the health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO) of her previous employer. Ms. Mowry was currently paying out-\nof-pocket so her HMO coverage could continue.\nDr. Gaskell had now had four appointments with Ms. Mowry. He had\nidentified patterns of what appeared to be paranoid thinking and had\ngenerally come to find her an unpleasant, difficult patient. She clearly did\nnot have a major psychiatric disorder. She was not psychotic—a paranoid\nschizophrenic—but she had personality traits that were causing her\nproblems.\nBy the end of her fourth visit with Dr. Gaskell, Ms. Mowry had become\nconvinced that Dr. Gaskell did not like her. She thought he seemed to be\nimplying that her employment problems were her own fault and that she\nneeded further therapy to address these issues. Ms. Mowry suspected that\nDr. Gaskell was keeping notes on her that would reflect his poor opinion of\nher. She asked to see her medical record.\nWhen Dr. Gaskell hesitated, Ms. Mowry indicated that she would\nreport him to the management of the HMO. Patients in the United States\nhave the right to review their medical records. However, some moral uncer-\ntainty still exists. In particular, many physicians, especially psychiatrists,\nare concerned that granting patients the right to see their records may\nharm patients as well as violate the privacy rights of the provider. Regard-\nless of the law, what is an ethically appropriate decision by Dr. Gaskell?",

Over four sessions, the psychiatrist has documented observations suggesting paranoid personality traits—not a major psychiatric disorder, but patterns of thinking that appear to contribute to her employment difficulties. The patient has now become suspicious that the psychiatrist dislikes her and is writing unflattering notes about her character. She requests to review her medical record immediately. The psychiatrist is concerned that reading his clinical notes—which include candid assessments of her personality patterns and their role in her conflicts—may worsen her paranoia, damage the therapeutic relationship, and provoke anger or distress that could destabilize her further. However, the patient has clearly stated her wish to see the record and believes she is entitled to know what is being written about her. You are the treating psychiatrist.",
