        "vignette": "A 7-year-old child with severe developmental delays and recurrent aspiration pneumonia is brought to your outpatient pediatrics clinic by her mother. The child has required three hospitalizations in the past year. A gastrostomy tube and ongoing intensive home nursing support would substantially reduce her risk of life-threatening aspiration events and improve her quality of life. However, your clinic operates within a publicly funded health system with a fixed annual budget for home nursing services. Approving this child for the intensive home nursing package she needs would consume resources equivalent to basic developmental support services for approximately fifteen other children with less acute but still significant needs on the waiting list. The clinic director has asked you, as the treating physician, whether to approve the intensive home nursing package for this patient or to provide her with standard follow-up care while preserving resources for the broader patient population.",
