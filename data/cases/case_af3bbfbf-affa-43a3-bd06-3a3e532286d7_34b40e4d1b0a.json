      "source_text": "Case 12-8\nThe Interrogation of Guantanamo Prisoner Mohammed al-Qahtani\nIn August 2001, Mohammed al-Qahtani arrived in the Orlando Florida\nAirport, allegedly to join the group of men who would go on to hijack the\nplanes on September 11. However, an observant interviewer was suspicious\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s story and deported him back to Saudi Arabia. During\nthe American invasion of Afghanistan in 2002, American soldiers captured\nMr. al-Qahtani and transferred him to the detention center at Guantanamo\nBay. Once authorities realized that he may have been directly involved\nwith the 9/11 hijackers, he was labeled a “high-value detainee.”\nIn 2002, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized\nextraordinary interrogation techniques for high-value detainees. He also\nmandated that these interrogations be subject to oversight by health\nprofessionals. To implement these policies, special teams were created to\nwork on interrogations—they were called Behavioral Science Consultation\nTeams (BSCTs). These teams were headed by a psychologist or psychiatrist.\nTheir job was not simply to monitor interrogations but to employ their\nknowledge of human psychology to better exploit a prisoner's psychological\nand cultural vulnerabilities for the purposes of extracting information.\nUnder the new interrogation guidelines, Mr. al-Qahtani was interro-\ngated using very aggressive and controversial techniques. These included\nbeing deprived of sleep for more than a week at a time, having hypothermia\ninduced by air conditioning, being exposed to barking, growling dogs to\nwhich the prisoner had a phobia, being forced to take many bags of intra-\nvenous fluid and then to urinate on himself, and being forced to violate\nvarious Islamic religious obligations and prohibitions.\nThroughout Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation, he was monitored daily\nby physicians. Although the physicians were officially not involved in the\ninterrogation itself but only in ensuring the prisoners continued health,\nthey were in frequent contact with the prisoner during the ongoing interro-\ngation. They helped to facilitate these tactics by approving the continua-\ntion of interrogation immediately after Mr. al-Qahtani had been treated\nfor severe hypothermia. On at least one occasion a medical professional\nwas involved in the administration of large amounts of intravenous fluid\nto the prisoner against his will for the purpose of causing discomfort and\nhumiliation.\nThe involvement of the BSCT psychologist in the interrogation tactics\nwas even more extensive. An army investigation revealed that the BSCT\npsychologist witnessed and possibly encouraged the use of growling and\nbarking dogs to terrify the prisoner. A log that details a two-month period\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation revealed that a BSCT psychologist later\nidentified as Major John Leso was present during the interrogation ses-\nsions. The log notes two instances in which Major Leso directly encour-\naged controversial psychological tactics. In the first instance, Major Leso\nsuggested that the prisoner be placed in a swivel chair so that he could be\nprevented from focusing his eyes on one spot. In the second instance, after\ndays of allowing the prisoner no sleep other than brief naps while shackled\nto the interrogation chair, Mr. al-Qahtani requested that he be allowed to\nsleep in a room other than the interrogation room. When interrogators\nconsulted Major Leso, he said that \"the detainee was only trying to run\nan approach on the control and gain sympathy.”\nIn addition to these two instances of the psychologist’s encouragement\nof controversial tactics, there is evidence of numerous other ways in which\nthe BSCT may have advised interrogators on how to harmfully manipulate\nthe prisoner's emotions and beliefs. Interrogators systematically violated\nvarious Islamic prohibitions. For example, a female interrogator would se-\nductively touch the prisoner. The interrogators disrespectfully handled the\nQuran. They shaved the prisoner's head and beard and repeatedly refused\nto allow him to pray. Further, they employed dehumanizing techniques\nsuch as leashing the prisoner like a dog and making him bark and remark-\ning that the prisoner's life was worse than that of the rats inhabiting the\ncompound.",
