More important, he correctly predicts that his level of function will deteriorate over the next several months and that he may become ventilator dependent.

You have discussed appropriate palliative care issues.\nWhat should you tell him?\na. You tell him that you will honor his wish because he is competent and not depressed.\nb. You tell him that you will honor his wish because his condition will worsen over time.\nc. You agree to his wish because he has a right to a better quality of life.\nd.
