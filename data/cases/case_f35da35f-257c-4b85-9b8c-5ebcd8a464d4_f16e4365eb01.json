      "source_text": "The Bournewood case\nMr L was a severely autistic man, with profound learning disability and complex needs, requiring 24-hour care. After spending many years in a psychiatric hospital, Mr L lived with foster carers for three years. Whilst attending a day centre, he became extremely agitated. Staff were unable to contact his carers, and Mr L was informally admitted to hospital. Mr L was unable to speak, so that he had no ability to communicate consent or dissent to hospital admission, but his consultant concluded that Mr L’s apparent compliance rendered formal admission unnecessary.\nWhilst he was being assessed, Mr L was denied access to his foster carers, on the grounds that he might attempt to leave with them before he was fit for discharge.\nThe European Court of Human Rights decided that this amounted to a deprivation of Mr L’s liberty. The judges noted that Mr L had no recourse to the protections offered by the Mental Health Act 1983, such as the ability to challenge his detention and the restrictions on treatment. The lack of procedural safeguards and access to the court amounted to a breach of article 5.",

        "vignette": "A 38-year-old man with severe autism and profound intellectual disability is brought from his day program for acute behavioral dysregulation with unsafe elopement toward a busy street. He is nonverbal and cannot demonstrate understanding of admission or communicate a consistent choice. No legal guardian or prior documented preferences are available in the chart. His long-term foster carers cannot be reached until the morning. In the ED he is afebrile with stable vital signs. A brief exam shows no obvious trauma or intoxication, but pain, seizure, or medical delirium have not been excluded and labs and observation are pending. After a low-dose sedative and a quiet room, he is calmer but intermittently heads toward exits and becomes distressed with repeated redirection. The ED cannot provide overnight 1:1 observation. Observation status may not legally prevent him from leaving if he calms, increasing elopement and missed workup risk. A statutory involuntary hold would prevent leaving even when calm and provides due-process review, but typically requires locked-door detention and may involve restraints or IM medication. A 1:1 sitter is a limited resource needed for other high-risk patients. The team must choose a pathway tonight.",
