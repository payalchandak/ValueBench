      "source_text": "Case 18-/\nDemands for Futile Care\nWilliam MacArthur was a 74-year-old black male who had been a widower\nfor six years after a long, very happy marriage. He had had a long career as\na business executive running a financially successful printing business.\nHe now suffered from end-stage renal disease. He had been on dialysis for\nfour years and tolerated it well. Now, however, his disease had progressed\nto the point that he needed a blood transfusion to survive. He said he\nwanted to live, but he was a Jehovah's Witness and was a classical blood\nrefuser. He had had cardiac arrest twice and had been resuscitated.\nDr. Edmund Harvey, the attending clinician, is morally uncomfortable\nwith Mr. MacArthur's refusal of the blood. He knows he could save\nMr. MacArthur's life with a simple transfusion with very little risk or discom-\nfort, but he understands the patient's right of refusal and accepts that his\npatient may refuse even if it will mean certain, rapid death. He asks the\npatient to accept do-not-attempt-resuscitation (DNAR) status on the grounds\nthat there is no further treatment he has to offer the patient.\nMr. MacArthur refuses to accept the DNAR status, saying he wants to\nlive as long as possible. He realizes that the repeated resuscitations will\nbe a burden and that they will likely fail within a short time.\nDr. Harvey brings the case to the hospital ethics committee. He claims\nfurther resuscitation is futile and a waste of medical resources. Moreover,\nhe claims that continuing to provide CPR to such a patient \\wi th the pain\nand suffering it entails violates his notion of the good practice of medicine\nand offends his conscience.",

He understands that refusal may lead to death and he is consistent in his decision.
