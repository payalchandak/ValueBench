      "source_text": "Case 7-2\nPlacebos for Addiction Withdrawal\nSeventy-four-year-old Mrs. Abraham had been getting the prescription\nfilled for years. She had a malignancy of the colon four years previously.\nAn operation had corrected the problem, but in the emotional and physical\ndistress that followed, Mrs. Abraham had a terrible time sleeping. She\nhad received a prescription from her internist, Dr. Raymond Siemens, for\nSeconal® to help her sleep and continued taking them to the point at which\nshe could not sleep without them. Her physician, after several months, real-\nized that he had caused her to become addicted and felt that it was his duty\nto help her break her habit. He had arranged with the pharmacist to take\nSeconal® capsules and gradually replace more and more of the active in-\ngredient, until some months later she was on pure lactose packaged in the\ndistinctive Seconal® capsules. She still claimed, however, that she could\nnot sleep without her sleeping pills.\nDr. Siemens firmly believed that it was in his patient's best interest, but\nhe felt uncomfortable about the placebo prescription he was writing. He\nwas concerned about potential legal implications of lack of informed con-\nsent. (He surely had not informed his patient of the treatment strategy and\nthe risks and benefits of the “drug” he was now prescribing.) Furthermore,\nhe was asking the pharmacist to mislabel the prescription, placing the\ndrug name on the prescription label when, in fact, it contained nothing but\ninert lactose. Mislabeling was against the law. He was concerned about\nthe fact that Mrs. Abraham was paying monthly for the prescription that\ncontained no active ingredients. The charge was modest, barely covering\nthe cost of the capsules’ ingredients that were being discarded, surely not\ncompensating the pharmacist for the extra time involved in emptying the\ncapsules and refilling them. But most of all he was concerned about\nwhether he was being dishonest.",
