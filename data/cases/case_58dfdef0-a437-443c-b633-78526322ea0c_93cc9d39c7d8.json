      "source_text": "Case 6-1\nBorderline Competency: Deciding about Major Heart Operations\nWilliam Maxwell was admitted to the hospital with chest pain, intermit-\ntently severe, poorly relieved by nitroglycerin. He was 69 years old, moder-\nately obese, hypertensive, and diabetic. Initial evaluations indicated\nsevere ischemic heart disease, believed to be life threatening. A recent di-\nagnosis of dementia had been made, but his competency to make autono-\nmous decisions was variable. Dr. Nina Sandstedt considered cardiac\ncatheterization necessary before any cardiac operative procedure could be\nplanned. :\nOn evaluation by Dr. Sandstedt and consultants, Mr. Maxwell was\nnoted to be awake, showing capacity for pleasure and pain, but disori-\nented. He could state his name but did not know what city he was in. Family\nmembers were available, and his wife, Esther, was available to act as a\nsurrogate. He could identify her by name.\nEvaluation of surgical mortality of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\nfor him suggested he had approximately a 10 percent chance of not surviv-\ning the procedure. Postoperative pain following placement of coronary\nbypass grafts would be considerable but could be controlled with medica-\ntion. Pneumonia and other complications could occur.\nThe professional dilemmas included satisfactory assessment of\nMr. Maxwell's mental capacity for decision-making,and successive discus-\nsions with him or surrogates as options for surgical treatment were clari-\nfied. Dr. Sandstedt believed that the procedure would be a major trauma\nfor a patient in Mr. Maxwell's condition, but she believed that, if it were she,\nshe would opt for the operation if the catheterization showed evidence that\nan operation would be beneficial. There was general agreement that the\nprobable benefits of surgical intervention outweighed his risks and pos-\nsible complications. On the other hand, she knew some patients with\nMr. Maxwell's degree of chronic heart impairment who had refused such\nprocedures. When Mr. Maxwell was asked, he seemed to resist the pro-\nposal of an operation, but his capacity to refuse consent was questionable.\nDr. Sandstedt knew she could not operate without a valid consent. Mr. Maxwell\nhad not discussed questions of life-prolonging treatment prior to the devel-\nopment of his dementia.",

        "vignette": "A 69-year-old man is admitted for episodic chest pressure over several days. He is now pain-free on intensive antianginal therapy. His ECG has no new ischemic changes and serial troponins remain negative. Stress imaging suggests significant coronary disease, and cardiology expects a high likelihood of a treatable lesion with meaningful angina relief and lower near-term infarction risk. He has progressive dementia with frequent delirium in the hospital and stage 4 chronic kidney disease. Cardiology notes high risk of prolonged delirium, bleeding, and contrast-induced kidney failure that could require dialysis. Without catheterization, he could have recurrent angina and a potentially preventable myocardial infarction despite maximal therapy. A bedside evaluation finds he cannot explain the procedure or consequences. He has no written advance directive, but his wife reports he previously said he would not want invasive procedures if they could lead to dialysis or prolonged confusion. His wife is his durable power of attorney. The only cath slot before discharge is tomorrow morning, and cath-lab capacity is limited.",
