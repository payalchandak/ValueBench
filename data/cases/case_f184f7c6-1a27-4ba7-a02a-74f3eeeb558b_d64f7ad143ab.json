One winter evening when he\nis travelling back from a conference down the M1, his bike skids on a patch of black ice.\nHe was driving at 90 mph. He hits the windscreen of an oncoming car and his helmet\nsplits in half. An ambulance arrives at the scene within minutes and Mike is intubated and\nrushed to hospital. He has sustained severe injuries – he has fractured his pelvis and several\nvertebrae. At h ospital he is assessed on the intensive care unit. Attempts to resuscitate him\nare u nsuccessful, and when he is weaned off the ventilator he does not make any respiratory\neffort. Tests performed by two different consultants confirm that he has had massive brain-\nstem injuries, and he is declared brainstem dead despite the ventilator continuing to keep his\nheart and lungs working and consequently the rest of his organs perfused. Mike is registered\non the national organ donation database and was carrying an organ donor card on him. It is\ndecided to keep him ventilated until his next of kin are traced and contacted, so that Mike’s\nwish to donate his organs can be discussed with them.\nQuestions\n• How can someone donate his or her organs after death?\n• Can the next of kin prevent organ donation?",
