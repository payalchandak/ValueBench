      "source_text": "CASE 7:\nRIGHTS AND DUTIES\nXavier is a 72-year-old man who is admitted to the intensive care unit where you are an FY1. He was clearing out a gutter when he fell off the ladder and hit his head on the pavement. Passers-by immediately called an ambulance, and he was taken straight to theatre, where a large subdural haematoma was drained. Subsequent tests indicate that he fell from his ladder because he suffered a massive myocardial infarction. He has yet to recover consciousness, and it is thought that he has had irreparable brain damage due to anoxia. He is married and has three sons. His eldest son works as a radiographer in the hospital. His second son is an evangelist with the Pentecostal church, is married and has three young children. His youngest son is travelling around Australia. The intensive care unit has a family room, which has been taken over by Xavier’s family. It is also constantly filled with well-wishers from the church who hold prayer and song meetings around the clock. Relatives of other patients are complaining about the lack of access to the family room and the noise levels. However, when the senior staff nurse asks them to keep the noise down, Xavier’s son threatens the hospital with legal action for religious discrimination. He also says that the hospital is impeding the chances of his father’s recovery because if they cannot hold a prayer meeting, the hospital is preventing the possibility of a miracle from God. Despite full active medical treatment and round-the-clock prayers, Xavier makes no improvement over the next 6 weeks. The medical team decides to discuss the possibility of allowing him to die in peace by withdrawing supportive medical intervention. He has multi-organ failure and has not regained consciousness. Xavier’s wife and one son refuse point blank to allow this to happen and insist that everything be done for him, including resuscitation. The staff on the unit are becoming upset that Xavier is not being allowed to die with peace and dignity. \nXavier’s eldest son supports the advice of the medical team and attempts to discuss it with his brother and mother. However, they threaten him with becoming a family outcast and divine retribution. They also continue to threaten the hospital with lawsuits as they do not believe that Xavier is being cared for properly. No joint decision is ever made, and after 11 weeks Xavier has a cardiac arrest and dies following a 60-minute cycle of resuscitation.\nQuestions\n• What are ‘rights’ and ‘duties’?\n• What is the difference between positive and negative rights?\n• Who has ‘rights’ in the above scenario?",

        "vignette": "A 72-year-old man collapsed from an acute myocardial infarction, fell, and developed an acute subdural hematoma that was evacuated emergently. He has been mechanically ventilated for 10 days. He remains unresponsive. His exam is limited by sedatives needed for ventilator synchrony. Brain MRI shows diffuse injury concerning for hypoxic-ischemic damage. He is not brain-dead, and reliable prognostication is usually deferred for another 48–72 hours. He now requires vasopressors for shock. His kidney failure is worsening, and dialysis is being considered. ENT and GI can place a tracheostomy and feeding tube today. The next opportunity is weeks away, and the ICU will not continue prolonged translaryngeal intubation. His wife is the legal surrogate. There is no advance directive, and past comments include both “don’t keep me on machines” and “do everything if there’s a chance.” Neurocritical care estimates a very low likelihood of meaningful neurologic recovery. A tracheostomy and feeding tube would add procedural risks and likely require weeks of ICU care with high risk of complications. Forgoing them would likely lead to death within days after extubation with comfort-focused care. The ICU is at capacity and procedural slots are scarce. An interdisciplinary review has occurred without consensus, and hospital policy and state law allow either course in this situation.",
