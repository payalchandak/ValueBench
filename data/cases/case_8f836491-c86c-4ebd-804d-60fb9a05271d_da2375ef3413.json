The results of a routine preg-\nnancy test revealed that, in spite of her great efforts to avoid it, she had con-\nceived and was then seven-and-a-half weeks pregnant. The pulmonologist\ncounseled her that her safest course of action was to end the pregnancy,\nsince in the best case, pregnancy with pulmonary hypertension carries a\n10-15 percent risk of mortality for a pregnant woman trying to carry to term,\nand because of the severity of her disease her own prospects were closer to\n90-50. The woman, a Catholic with four children, decided not to terminate.\nOn November 3, 2009, the woman was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospi-\ntal and Medical Center in Phoenix with worsening symptoms. A cardiac\ncatheterization revealed that the woman now had “very severe pulmo-\nnary arterial hypertension with profoundly reduced cardiac output.” In\nanother part of the record a different physician confirmed “severe, life-\nthreatening pulmonary hypertension,” “right heart failure,” and “cardio-\ngenic shock.” The chart noted that she had been informed that her risk of\nmortality “approaches 100%,” is “near 100%,\" and is “close to 100%” if she\ncontinued the pregnancy.” The chart also noted that “surgery is abso-\nlutely contraindicated.”\nSister Margaret Mary McBride, the Mission Leader and liaison to the\nhospital's Ethics Committee, brought this case to the Ethics Committee for\nconsultation; the consultation team consulted several physicians and\nnurses as well as the patient's record. Sister then brought the results of the\nCommittee's deliberation—that a termination of pregnancy, if the mother\nwanted it, was appropriate since the goal was not to end the pregnancy but\nto save the mother’s life—back to the physician. The termination was per-\nformed on November 5.°\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nArgue for and against the findings of the ethics consultation team at St. Joseph\nHospital. Which arguments are most compelling and why?\n- Does the principle of double effect justify the recommendation of the ethics\nconsultation team?\n» How might a rule-utilitarian reason to a resolution in this case?",
