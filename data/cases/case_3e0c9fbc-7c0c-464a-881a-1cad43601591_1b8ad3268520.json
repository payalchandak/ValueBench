Her partner carries the same variant but is unaffected, so there is a substantial chance their child would be deaf. She and her partner communicate primarily through sign language and are clear that they want to avoid passing on the variant if possible. They request pre-implantation genetic testing so only embryos without the variant are transferred. The fertility clinic can offer standard IVF without testing, or IVF with embryo testing and selection, which would mean discarding or indefinitely storing embryos that carry the variant. The patient says she feels responsible to “do everything she can” to prevent deafness in her child, but she also worries this choice rejects a community that has been central to her life. Clinic policy and state law permit either approach. Their insurance authorization expires this week, so a plan must be set now.",
