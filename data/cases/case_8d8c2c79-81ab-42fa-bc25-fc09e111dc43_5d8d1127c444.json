        "vignette": "An adult patient with a history of major depression and prior suicide attempt comes to the Emergency Department after a partner found a handwritten “goodbye” note and reported the patient had been giving away valuables. In the ED the patient is calm, sober, and oriented, denies a current plan or intent, and articulates reasons for living, but also says they feel “done” and refuses psychiatric admission, medications, and permission to contact family. The ED psychiatrist judges the patient can describe options and consequences, yet worries that the recent behaviors and limited supports make the risk of serious self-harm unacceptably high if the patient leaves tonight. The psychiatrist must decide whether to use emergency detention to keep the patient for involuntary evaluation and possible hospitalization, or to honor the patient’s refusal and arrange the least restrictive discharge plan available.",

        "vignette": "A 28-year-old man with major depressive disorder presents to the emergency department after his coworker called 911. The coworker reports receiving a text message from the patient late last night saying, “I can’t do this anymore—tell my mom I’m sorry,” after which the patient did not respond for several hours.\n\nIn the ED, he is calm, cooperative, and fully oriented. His speech is coherent and thought process is linear. He reports worsening depression over the last month after a recent SSRI dose increase. He denies current suicidal intent or a specific plan and says he regrets sending the text. He reports a prior episode of cutting his forearm 2 years ago “to relieve pressure,” without prior psychiatric hospitalization.\n\nOn formal assessment, he demonstrates decision-making capacity: he accurately describes his condition and options, understands the potential risks (including self-harm), can compare consequences, and communicates a stable choice. He clearly refuses psychiatric admission, stating, “I’m not staying here. I have to go to work tomorrow.”\n\nThe clinician is concerned about near-term safety because the message could reflect imminent suicidal intent, he has a history of self-injury, his medication was recently changed, and key collateral is unavailable (the coworker is now unreachable, and the patient refuses permission to contact family). The patient lives alone. When asked about lethal means, he initially says he has “a gun somewhere” at home but is vague about where it is and whether it is locked.\n\nThe clinician explains that an involuntary hold would allow extended observation during a high-risk window, time to obtain collateral information, clarify and mitigate access to lethal means, and arrange a safer disposition. The alternative is discharge, but only if concrete safeguards can be confirmed in real time (reliable supervision, verified means restriction, and rapid follow-up).",
