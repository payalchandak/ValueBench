      "source_text": "Case 4-l\nStimulants as Performance Enhancer\nMichael Chadwell was a 22-year-old medical student studying for his final\nexams in the first semester of his first year. He had been struggling all\nsemester to keep up with the amount of reading and studying that was\nrequired. He had particular problems with pathophysiology and knew he\nwas “on the bubble.” He needed the best grade he could possibly get on the\nfinal to avoid a failing grade.\nHe simply had to cram for the exam day and night. About a month ago,\nMichael noticed that one of his classmates, Sheila Tan, always seemed to\nbe alert and full of energy when the other members of their study group\nwere flagging. When he asked how she had so much energy, she told him,\n“I take those diet pills that you can get over the counter at any drugstore.\nSometimes I add phentermine_Iw chain cgeht on the Internet.” He asked\nher about the Sead of detection-of the drugs bb ecause the university\nwas.a— : vironment and they had agreed to this when entering\nmedical school. Sheila responded, \"I was worarboiut ethadt, b ut you would\nhave to take a bucket of this stuff to have it show up in your urine.” At the\nend of their conversation, Sheila had given him some of the phentermine to\ntry. Michael also bought some diet pills at his local pharmacy. He had not\nused either of them yet, but if there was ever a time he might need help in\nmaking it through the week, he reasoned, this was it.\nHe had never taken either of these drugs, so _he-was_not sure of the\neffect. He was a little concerned that they mightb e more potent than Sheila\nlet on because he noticed lately that she had gotten quite thin.a nd haggard\nlooking. She told him, “I am only sleeping about 3 hoursa night. I cannot\nwake up without these pills.” He> is not sure how much she is taking, though,\nand did not plan on taking more than a few pills a day to get him through\nthis week of studying. Without it he felt sure he would not do well on the\nexam; with the drugs he might do well. He thought he had little to lose and\nan entire career to gain.\nShould he take the pills even though he knows there could be some se-\nrious side effects? What if it is discovered that he has broken the \"drug-free\"\npolicy of the School of Medicine?",
