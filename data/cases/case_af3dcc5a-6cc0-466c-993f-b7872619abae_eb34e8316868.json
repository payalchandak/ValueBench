The pediatric emergency department is operating at full capacity with limited nursing staff. Providing the level of one-on-one attention this child needs would require pulling a nurse from the general pediatric area, where she currently monitors six other children with various acute conditions including a febrile infant awaiting lumbar puncture results, two children with moderate dehydration receiving IV fluids, and others requiring frequent reassessment. The attending physician must decide whether to dedicate a nurse exclusively to the asthmatic child to optimize their care and enable more aggressive treatment, or to maintain current staffing distribution to ensure adequate monitoring and timely care for all children in the department.",
