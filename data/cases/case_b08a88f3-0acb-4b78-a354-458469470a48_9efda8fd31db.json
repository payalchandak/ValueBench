His vital signs are stable; the initial ECG shows no clear ischemic changes, and the first cardiac blood test is not elevated, but the story is concerning enough that an evolving heart attack cannot be ruled out without repeat testing and monitoring. The hospital is running at capacity: all monitored/telemetry beds are full, several higher-acuity patients are boarding in the ED, and keeping this patient for overnight observation would likely require using a scarce monitored bed or prolonged ED boarding that delays care for others. The physician must decide whether to keep him in the hospital for serial testing and monitoring or to discharge him with rapid outpatient follow-up and clear return precautions.",

The attending explains that for low-risk chest pain, guidelines support either (1) a short observation pathway with serial troponins/telemetry to increase diagnostic certainty or (2) discharge with expedited outpatient follow-up and strict return precautions, with an estimated <1% 30-day risk of major adverse cardiac events after discharge when criteria are met.
