The parents are at the bedside, are calm and coherent, and demonstrate decision-making capacity. They refuse intubation because they fear prolonged suffering and say they previously watched a close family member die after weeks on a ventilator and do not want their child to “go through that.”\n\nThis is an emergent, time-sensitive decision; an ethics consult and court order are not feasible before the airway may close.",
