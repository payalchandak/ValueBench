      "source_text": "The case of Baby Ryan\nRyan Nguyen was born 6 weeks prematurely, asphyxi-\nated, and with only a weak heartbeat. His clinicians\nalso diagnosed brain damage following seizures, an\nintestinal blockage, and renal failure which meant\nthat his kidneys failed to clear toxins, although they\nproduced urine. Initially, Ryan was sustained through\nintravenous feeding and dialysis, but his clinicians\ndoubted that he could be kept alive in this fashion\nuntil he was old enough for a kidney transplant, at\nabout 2 years. They wanted to end treatment on the\ngrounds of futility: it was argued that long-term dial-\nysis would not only be inappropriate but would be\n’\nimmoral , since it would prolong Ryan s su ering with\nno chance of improvement.\n’\nRyan s parents refused to accept withdrawal of\n’\ntreatment, despite the hospital s view that imposing\n‘ ’\nvirtually futile treatment would be inhumane. The\nNguyens sought a second opinion from a neonatolo-\ngist at another hospital, but that, too, was unfavour-\nable. Finally, they obtained an emergency court order,\npermitted under the legislation of their home state,\ndirecting the hospital to take whatever steps were\n’\nnecessary to maintain Ryan s life, including dialysis.\nThe publicity surrounding the case attracted another\n’\nhospital s attention, and this third hospital accepted\nRyan for transfer. Three days later, surgeons there\noperated to clear Ryan s blocked intestines. He was\nshortly able to take nutrition by mouth, and at 3\nmonths he was sent home, not having needed any\nfurther dialysis. At 1 year he appeared to be develop-\nfi\ning normally for his age, free of any permanent neuro-\nlogical de cit; his most recent CAT scan shows no\nstructural problems.",

He also has an intestinal obstruction and acute renal failure. He makes urine, but his kidneys are not clearing toxins. In the NICU he is on IV nutrition and has needed dialysis through a central line. The obstruction might be surgically correctable, but he is medically fragile and would likely need ongoing dialysis afterward while his neurologic prognosis remains unclear. The team worries that repeated procedures, lines, and dialysis sessions will prolong discomfort with little chance of meaningful recovery. His parents ask you to “do everything” and want surgery and continued dialysis. A decision is needed today because his labs are worsening and the operating room can only hold a slot for this evening.
