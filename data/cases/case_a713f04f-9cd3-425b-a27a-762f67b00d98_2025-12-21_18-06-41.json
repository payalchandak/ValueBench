      "source_text": "93. A 43-year-old patient asks the physician to examine his 75-year-old\nmother, who has been complaining of headaches. When the woman\npresents for her first appointment, she admits to having a severe,\npersistent headache for the past 4 weeks. She says the headache is\nworse in the morning and always lingers throughout the day. She\nusually feels nauseated but has no vomiting. Her medical history is\nsignificant for severe depression and anxiety, and her current\nmedications include an antidepressant. A complete workup shows\nthat she has a brain tumor, likely a glioblastoma. Both she and her\nson (also the physician's patient) are present at today's appointment\nto learn of the diagnosis. Before the physician has a chance to discuss\nthe findings, the son steps outside the patient's room and requests\nthat the physician not reveal the diagnosis to his mother.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate response?\na. \"As a physician, I always tell a patient about a serious diagnosis, as it is my\nmoral responsibility.\"\nb. \"If you feel this strongly about it, how about I delay giving her information\nnow, but tell her at a later date?\"\nc. \"Is there a specific reason why you do not want your mother to know the\ndiagnosis?\"\nd. \"Leave the matter to me as I will determine whether she should know her\ndiagnosis.\"\ne. \"This news would only be upsetting to her and therefore I will not discuss the\ndiagnosis at all.\"",
