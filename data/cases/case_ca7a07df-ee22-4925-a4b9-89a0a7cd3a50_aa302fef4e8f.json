A hospital employee arrives with ID and says he is the patient’s closest friend and emergency contact. He asks what happened and whether the patient is going to die. He offers to bring the patient’s medication list and a document the patient kept at home about treatment wishes. In the ED note, the patient had said he “doesn’t want people at work to know about the cancer.” Hospital privacy policy permits limited disclosure to a person involved in care when the patient cannot consent, but it also supports waiting for the patient’s permission when feasible.",

        "vignette": "A 58-year-old man with metastatic lung cancer is admitted overnight with a large pulmonary embolus. He is in the ICU on high-flow oxygen. He is intermittently lucid but worsening, and the team expects to intubate and sedate him within hours. No advance directive, code status, or health care proxy is in the chart. Repeated calls to listed family numbers go to voicemail. The EHR lists a workplace colleague as the emergency contact. The colleague arrives and confirms identity with photo ID. He says he can quickly bring the patient’s current medication bottles and a folder kept at home about treatment wishes. The team also needs any known code status and anticoagulation history before intubation. The colleague is in the patient’s HR chain. The patient previously told ED staff he wanted health information kept from “people at work,” but he did not specify whether this colleague was included. Sharing details could expose the patient to workplace stigma or job-related consequences if the information spreads. Withholding details could delay time-sensitive, goal-concordant decisions or contribute to medication errors. Policy and privacy law allow limited disclosure to an identified emergency contact when the patient lacks capacity or withholding details to honor possible prior preferences.",
