      "source_text": "Case study: the Montjoie affair\nUntil the early 1980s most professionals working with abused children in France would invoke the ‘Law of Silence’. In this era of silence abuses of discretion abounded. It was difficult to evaluate the number of ill-treated children, or even of fatal cases of abuse. The percentage of abuse cases reported to the judicial authorities was very low. Yet the law did make it plain that doctors were to be released from their normal professional duty of confidentiality when, in the course of their work, they came to know of abuse and neglect of children under the age of 15.\nIn the early 1980s, however, a public campaign was organized around the slogan, ‘50 000 children are abused every year; speaking out is the first step’. Interministerial circulars of 1983 and 1985 informed practitioners of their responsibilities and specified procedures for hospital admission in cases of suspected abuse. This was followed up by legislation on the prevention of child abuse, in May 1989.\nBut difficulties about confidentiality remained. There was a basic discrepancy between an article of the criminal code which respected professional confidentiality and another article which allowed the criminal prosecution of anyone who ‘having knowledge about abuse of a child under the age of 15, does not report the case to the administrative or judicial authorities’. While it was clear that the doctor may report the case of an abused child without fear of criminal proceedings for breach of confidentiality, it was less clear whether he or she had an active responsibility to report cases of abuse encountered in the line of professional practice. Doctors were free to report abuse, but were they obliged to do so?\nIn December 1992 these dilemmas came to a head in the ‘Montjoie affair’. Damien, aged seven, and Mickael, aged 18, had been placed together in a foster family, but Damien’s foster parents informed Mickael’s educational psychologist that Damien had complained of being abused by Mickael. The psychiatrist on the team, Dr Bernard Chouraqui, was informed two days later that the psychologist wished to separate the two boys immediately, sending Mickael to another foster family. After discussion the team decided to wait 10 days before informing the judicial authorities so as to allow constructive therapy for Mickael, who was thought to be on the verge of a breakdown, which would be worsened by the threat of prosecution. The clinical team felt that he needed to be prepared to face the judicial consequences of his act.\nThe juvenile court was duly informed two weeks after the abuse had first been reported. In January 1993 the investigating judge charged the educational psychologist and the social worker on the team with ‘not having reported the abuse’. On the same day the psychiatrist, Dr Chouraqui, appeared before the juvenile court of his own free will to explain the situation. He was immediately charged with the same offence and imprisoned, together with the educational psychologist. Dr Chouraqui was not released to await trial for another two weeks; at his trial 10 months later, however, he was acquitted.",

The foster parents want the two boys kept in the home and ask you to “handle it in therapy.” The older teen has a history of depression and recent self-harm, and his outpatient clinician warns that sudden legal involvement could destabilize him. The foster agency can separate the boys today, but it wants your plan before arranging placements.
