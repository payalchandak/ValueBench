      "source_text": "=». Case 3-5\nAbortion in a Catholic Hospital\nNatasha Jones was a 34-year-old, single, African American woman preg-\nnant for the fourth time. She was being seen in the prenatal clinic at the\ncommunity's only tertiary care Catholic hospital because she had a history\nof three previous episodes of ruptured uterus that had resulted in the\ndeaths of her previous fetuses. She was currently in her twentieth week of\npregnancy. She was a member of a local Baptist church.\nDr. Lakisha Nevitt, her attending physician, was very concerned be-\ncause ultrasound revealed that a portion of Ms. Jones's uterine wall was no\nmore than a millimeter in thickness. She was convinced it would soon rup-\nture, ending the life of the fetus and posing a serious risk to Ms. Jones's life.\nIt was her opinion that, with virtual certainty, the uterus would rupture\nbefore the fetus could reach full term.\nDr. Nevitt knew that, since the hospital had a Roman Catholic affilia-\ntion, abortion could not be performed there. Even though Dr. Nevitt was\nherself not Catholic, she accepted this stance when she went to work at this\nhospital. Even if an exception could be made in this case to preserve the\nlife of the mother, no one in the hospital's obstetrics department had enough\nexperience with abortion to perform one safely. The real issue was whether\nthey should advise Ms. Jones of the seriousness of her situation and recom-\nmend that she be transferred to City Hospital, which was only a mile away\nand had a staff with considerable experience with abortion.\nDr. Nevitt asked for a hospital ethics committee meeting to try to sort\nout the options. There was a quick consensus among the medical people on\nthe committee that this was a life-threatening situation and that Ms. Jones's\nuterus would almost certainly rupture well before a full-term birth. The\nethics committee included two Catholic chaplains, both of whom empha-\nsized that since they were in a Catholic institution, they must begin with\nthe presumption that all life, including fetal life, is sacred and cannot be\nintentionally terminated. The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic\nHealth Care Services was cited, which states categorically, “Abortion (that\nis, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the\ndirectly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted.”\nOne of the committee members raised the question of whether an ex-\nception can be made for preserving the life of the mother. He pointed out\nthat it seems tragic to condone the death of both mother and fetus when at\nleast the mother could be saved. Since this was an extremely rare case\nwhere there was virtual certainty that the mother could not survive the rup-\nture and that, if this occurred, the fetus would die as well, he urged making\nan exception by informing the woman that their committee recommend\nthat she be transferred to a secular hospital such as City Hospital.\nOne of the chaplains responded, pointing out that the prohibition was\nexceptionless. The only possibility would be to interpret the intervention as\nan “indirect” killing of the fetus, which would be acceptable for proportion-\nally good reasons. This, he indicated, was the reasoning used in cases in\nwhich a pregnant woman has cancer of the uterus. In such cases a hyster-\nectomy is permitted to remove the cancer even though the fetus would die\nin the process. He suggested that perhaps a hysterectomy could be accept-\nable in this case as well since the weakness in the uterine wall would pose\na threat to the woman not only in this pregnancy but in any future pregnan-\ncies as well. He acknowledged that this reasoning was controversial but\nthought it would justify a recommendation from the committee that the pa-\ntient be directed to the City Hospital. He noted that legally the hospital was\nnot required to have staff to perform abortions, but that they were required\nto inform the patient of treatment options—including transferring to an-\nother hospital that would offer abortion services.\nThe committee members recognized that, if this case had arisen in any\nother hospital without an institutional commitment opposing all direct\nabortions, a recommendation for terminating this pregnancy would be\nreached by easy consensus.\nThe dilemma here is how the moral stance of the sponsors of the hospi-\ntal should shape the way medicine is practiced in this institution.",

        "vignette": "A 34-year-old woman is 20 weeks pregnant. In a prior pregnancy she had a uterine rupture at a cesarean scar with fetal death. A later pregnancy had a scar “window” that was repaired at delivery. She is clinically stable with no bleeding or contractions, but she reports intermittent lower abdominal pain. Ultrasound shows focal scar thinning concerning for early dehiscence. Maternal-fetal medicine consultants disagree on how predictive this finding is. Several believe rupture could be sudden and catastrophic in the near term and that monitoring may not prevent it. They note neonatal survival is very unlikely before 24 weeks. The patient has decision-making capacity. She understands the maternal risks and refuses a planned termination today. She wants to continue the pregnancy for any chance of neonatal survival. The only tertiary center in the region is Catholic and will not perform a planned previable procedure that directly ends the pregnancy. A nearby nonsectarian hospital can provide second-trimester termination and is expected to be safer for her than expectant management, but transfer may take time and termination carries hemorrhage and possible hysterectomy risk in a heavily scarred uterus. Hospital counsel confirms either plan is legally permissible. A decision is needed today.",
