      "source_text": "CASE 1:\nPRINCIPLISM\nOphelia is a 27-year-old woman who has struggled with anorexia nervosa since she was 11 years old. She is extremely intelligent, and having gained a first class degree in history at Oxford University, she is now halfway through her PhD. It is at times when her life is most stressful that she struggles with her anorexia. The first time she was admitted to hospital was when she was 13. She was being badly bullied at school and had stopped eating in order to become thin to prevent being teased about being overweight. Being able to lose so much weight gave her the sense that she had some control over at least one aspect of her life. Ophelia has spent the past 14 years in and out of hospital. On two occasions she had to be admitted to intensive care as she had lost consciousness. During these admissions she was fed by a nasogastric tube. She also has a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and has been receiving cognitive behavioural therapy. A year ago she had managed to stabilise her weight at 50 kg – she is 1.7 m tall. With the stress of her PhD and the breakdown of her relationship with her boyfriend, when you initially see Ophelia she weighs less than 35 kg. Although you want to feed her by nasogastric tube to prevent her needing a third admission to intensive care, she adamantly refuses to have this. She tells you that she does not want to die, but neither does she want to be force fed. She is extremely frail and needs constant supervision by a healthcare assistant. Due to a shortage of beds on the psychiatric ward, Ophelia is currently being nursed on a general ward. The older women in her bay are complaining about the amount of personal attention she is receiving, as when they need assistance to change position or to go to the bathroom there is often a long wait due to staff shortages.\nQuestions\n• What is principlism?\n• How can the four principles be applied to this case scenario to offer guidance to the doctor about whether Ophelia should be force fed?",

        "vignette": "A 27-year-old woman with longstanding anorexia nervosa is admitted for profound weight loss after months of worsening restriction. She is alert, articulate, and says she does not want to die. She refuses nasogastric feeding and asks for “time to manage it myself,” agreeing only to small oral intake. Her vitals are tenuous and the team worries she could decompensate quickly without enteral nutrition. She requires constant observation to prevent purging and exercise. Because no psychiatric bed is available, she is being cared for on a busy medical ward with limited staffing. The 1:1 supervision and frequent checks are delaying routine nursing care for other inpatients and escalating conflict on the unit. You must decide today whether to proceed with tube feeding despite her objections or continue voluntary care without forced feeding. Hospital counsel confirms that either approach is legally permissible here.",
