The obstetric team believes vaginal delivery is very unlikely to succeed without major risk to the fetus and could also cause maternal injury. They recommend an urgent cesarean section. She is calm, coherent, and repeats that she understands the surgery and its risks. She refuses and asks to proceed without an operation. Her partner wants the team to “do whatever it takes,” but she is the only decision-maker. The fetal tracing is currently acceptable but has begun to show intermittent decelerations, and the team expects the window for a controlled procedure may close soon.
