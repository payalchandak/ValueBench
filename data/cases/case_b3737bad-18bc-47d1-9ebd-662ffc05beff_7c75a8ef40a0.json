      "source_text": "Case 18-5\nPicking Parents to Make Good Medical Choices\nPhillip Becker was 12 years old in 1978 when critical medical problems\narose in his care. He had been born on October 16, 1966. He was determined\nto have Down syndrome, a congenital heart defect (a ventricular septal\ndefect), and elevated pulmonary blood pressure. With these problems he\n- would suffer progressive loss of energy and vitality until he is forced to\nlead a bed-to-chair existence.\nFor reasons that are unknown, when Phillip was an infant no action\nwas taken to correct his septal defect. In 1977, Dr. Gathman, a pediatric\ncardiologist, recommended catheterization to determine if an operation\nwould be appropriate at this late point for the septal defect. Phillip was\nreferred to second cardiologist who is less convinced than Dr. Gathman\nthat the procedure would help.\nPhillip's parents were told that the mortality risk from an operation\nwas between 5 and 10 percent and that children with Down syndrome\nhave higher-than-average risk. Without the operation he will face severe\nincapacitation. The longer the wait, the more risky the procedure will\nbecome. The heart must work three times harder than normal to supply\nblood. Without the operation he may live twenty more years. With it—if it\nis successful—he will live the life of a normal Down syndrome child,\nwhich, they were told, is less than a normal life span but clearly longer\nthan twenty years.\nConsidering all of the risks and benefits, Phillip’s parents refused the\noperation. They gave a range of arguments based on the welfare of child\nincluding the risk of immediate mortality, the pain and suffering from the\nsurgery, and the concern that they were responsible for Phillip’s welfare\nand that, if he outlived them, he could suffer from neglect from whoever\nwould end up caring for him. The court accepted the parental refusal on\nthese grounds.\nAlthough it had not been emphasized during the original court delib-\nerations, Phillip had been transferred to a residential facility called the\nWe-Care facility in 1972. It was claimed that the parents had been advised\nnot to remain emotionally close to Phillip in order to spare him the trauma\nof not being with them. ;\nA volunteer named Patsy Heath became involved and began to de-\nvelop a bond with Phillip. Eventually, he began making overnight visits to\nthe Heath household and was accepted as part of their family. The Heaths\nwere awarded guardianship on August 7, 1981, on the grounds that the\nHeaths were, de facto, the psychological parents and should have custody.\nIn doing so the second court was aware that the Heaths wanted Philip to\nundergo the operation.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nReview the reasons the Beckers refused the surgical procedure for Phillip. Do\nyou find the reasons sound or not?\nHow much, if at all, does the diagnosis of Down syndrome influence your view\nof whether the surgery should be performed or not?\nGiven that the Beckers thought surgical correction was not in Phillip’s interest\nand the Heaths thought it was, should custody be determined on the basis of\nwhich adults are making the most defensible choice for Phillip?",

He is increasingly fatigued and has stopped playing at school. His cardiologist believes invasive catheterization could determine whether late surgical repair is still possible. The operation would require bypass, prolonged hospitalization, and significant pain. It also carries a real chance of dying on the table or leaving him with new neurologic injury. If the defect cannot be repaired, the catheterization itself adds risk with no direct benefit. Without surgery, he will likely decline over the coming years to severe limitation, but he may live for years with careful medical therapy.
