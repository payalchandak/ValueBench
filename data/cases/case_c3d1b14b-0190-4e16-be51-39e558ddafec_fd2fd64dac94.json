She tried\nshort-term therapy in the form of cognitive-behavioral treatments, with\nonly moderate improvement in her problems.\nOn the basis of a friend's suggestion about analysis being helpful to\nhim, she consulted Dr. Steven Melby, a psychoanalyst in private practice.\nDr. Melby noted the complexity and long-standing nature of her problems\nas well as her capacity for insightful reflection. Given these, he recom-\nmended intensive treatment requiring four weekly appointments for an\nextended period of time.\nShe then discovered that her health insurance plan covered only twenty\nsessions per year. Although a new federal mental health parity law prohib-\nits unequal co-payments and lifetime caps on mental and physical condi-\ntions, it does not prohibit limiting the number of visits per year.",

She completed a structured course of cognitive-behavioral therapy and uses an SSRI, with only partial relief. She asks you to support intensive psychoanalytic treatment with a community psychoanalyst who will see her four times weekly. Her insurance covers only a limited number of psychotherapy visits each year, and additional sessions require a medical-necessity exception. The psychoanalyst believes the work needs to be frequent and long-term to be effective, and the patient is willing to commit. The insurer’s appeal window closes in two weeks, and the patient says she cannot afford ongoing sessions without coverage.
