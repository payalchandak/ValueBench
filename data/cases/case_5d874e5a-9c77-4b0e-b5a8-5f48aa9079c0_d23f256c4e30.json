      "source_text": "Baby Doe: Legal and Moral Options\nOn April 9, 1982, a baby was born in Bloomington, Indiana, who would\neventually be referred to as “Baby Doe.”* He had an esophageal atresia\n(a blockage of the tube that carries food to the stomach) and an associated\ntracheo-esophageal fistula (an opening between the esophagus and the\ntrachea that would permit food to pass into the lungs rather than the stom-\nach). He also had a genetic condition known as Down syndrome. The Down\nsyndrome would leave the boy with some undetermined level of mental —\nretardation even if his anatomical problems were corrected, but, according\nto published reports, the child would have a high probability of surviving,\nalbeit with the Down syndrome, if his only medical problems were the sur-\ngically correctable fistula and atresia.\nThe attending obstetrician, Walter Owens, informed the parents that,\neven with the operation, the child would still not be normal. He would\n“have all the problems that even the best of them have.” He added that\n“some of these children ... are mere blobs” (cited in U.S. Commission on\nCivil Rights, p. 22).\nOn the basis of this information, the parents decided not to permit op-\neration to correct the fistula. The parents were trained as teachers and had\nexperience teaching handicapped and retarded children. They had two\nother children without Down syndrome.\nSome reports indicated that the baby also had a cardiac septal defect,\na serious malformation of the heart that would require operative repair.\nThat possibility might explain why some claims were made that the child\nhad only a 50-50 chance of survival even with operation.°®\nWhen nurses protested the decision of the parents not to treat, the hospi-\ntal sought judicial intervention. In the lower court, Judge John G. Baker\nsupported the parental decision, finding that the parents, after being fully\ninformed, “have the right to choose a medically recommended course of\ntreatment for their child in the present circumstances.” The Indiana Supreme\nCourt refused to get involved, thus upholding the lower court's decision.\nThose opposing the parents sought appeal to U.S. Supreme Court, but\nthat appeal was made moot by death of the baby on April 15. Two weeks\nlater, President Reagan asked the Attorney General and Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to become involved, noting that federal\nlaw prohibits discrimination against the handicapped. This led to the issu-\ning of a notice that it was illegal to discriminate against infants solely on\nthe basis of handicap. While this notice was rejected by the courts, eventu-\nally a law was passed classifying withholding of life support in cases such\nas this as child abuse.”",

        "vignette": "A term newborn has esophageal atresia with a distal tracheoesophageal fistula. Secretions reflux into the airway, so the baby is NPO on continuous suction and IV fluids. Despite these measures, the infant needs escalating respiratory support and cannot be stabilized safely beyond the next several hours. The baby also has Down syndrome. Echocardiogram suggests a complete atrioventricular canal defect with early pulmonary hypertension. The airway exam raises concern for severe tracheomalacia. The surgeon says repair is technically possible today and offers the only path to survival, but the infant would likely require prolonged ventilation, possible tracheostomy, and later procedures for strictures and feeding access, in addition to major cardiac surgery in infancy. Without repair, the team expects progressive respiratory failure and death within a short time despite suction, oxygen, and sedation for comfort. The parents understand survival is possible but request comfort-focused care to avoid repeated invasive support and prolonged dependence. After an expedited ethics consult, hospital policy and state law permit either operative management or a palliative plan. The team must choose a plan now; transfer or staging is not feasible in time.",
