She is well-informed and adamant about attempting vaginal birth, citing personal autonomy and recovery concerns. Her obstetrician believes the risk of uterine rupture is substantial given her surgical history, potentially leading to catastrophic hemorrhage and fetal compromise. Both maternal and fetal outcomes could be significantly better with planned cesarean delivery. The patient refuses scheduled cesarean and insists on attempting labor. You are the attending obstetrician managing her care.",
