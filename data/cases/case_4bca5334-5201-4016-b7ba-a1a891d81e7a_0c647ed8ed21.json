      "source_text": "A rivalry of care case In their book, The Patient in the Family, Hilde and James Lindemann Nelson describe the case of a man whose daughter is suffering from kidney failure (Lindemann Nelson and Lindemann Nelson, 1995). She is spending six hours, three times a week on a dialysis machine and the effects of this are becoming increasingly hard for her and her family to bear. She has already had one kidney transplant, which her body rejected, and her doctors are unsure whether a second would work but are willing to try if they can find a suitable donor. After some tests the paediatrician privately tells the father that he is compatible and therefore a suitable donor.\nIt may seem inconceivable that a father would refuse to donate his kidney to his daughter under such circumstances. Yet he does refuse and justifies his decision both on the grounds that the success of the transplant is uncertain and also on the basis of his concerns about the implications of the operation itself for him and his family. He is frightened and worried about what would happen to him and his other children if his remaining kidney were to fail. But he is ashamed to feel this way and cannot bear to refuse openly so he asks the paediatrician to tell the family that he is in fact not compatible. However, whilst having some sympathy, she says she cannot lie for him and, after a silence, the father says, ‘OK then I’ll do it. If they knew that I was compatible but wouldn’t donate my kidney, it would wreck the family’.",

When you refuse, he says he will donate anyway because refusing openly would “destroy the family.” The transplant is tentatively scheduled for next week and the daughter’s team needs a final donor decision within days.
