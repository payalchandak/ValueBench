      "source_text": "The Bournewood case\nMr L was a severely autistic man, with profound learning disability and complex needs, requiring 24-hour care. After spending many years in a psychiatric hospital, Mr L lived with foster carers for three years. Whilst attending a day centre, he became extremely agitated. Staff were unable to contact his carers, and Mr L was informally admitted to hospital. Mr L was unable to speak, so that he had no ability to communicate consent or dissent to hospital admission, but his consultant concluded that Mr L’s apparent compliance rendered formal admission unnecessary.\nWhilst he was being assessed, Mr L was denied access to his foster carers, on the grounds that he might attempt to leave with them before he was fit for discharge.\nThe European Court of Human Rights decided that this amounted to a deprivation of Mr L’s liberty. The judges noted that Mr L had no recourse to the protections offered by the Mental Health Act 1983, such as the ability to challenge his detention and the restrictions on treatment. The lack of procedural safeguards and access to the court amounted to a breach of article 5.",

While at his day program, he becomes acutely agitated and distressed, exhibiting self-injurious behavior. His foster carers cannot be reached. His psychiatrist believes hospitalization is necessary to assess for a medical cause and ensure safety, but the patient cannot verbally communicate consent or refusal. He does not resist when staff guide him to the hospital, appearing passive and compliant. The psychiatrist must decide whether to admit him informally based on his apparent compliance, allowing flexibility in his care and maintaining his legal freedom, or to pursue formal involuntary commitment, which would grant him explicit legal protections, rights to appeal, and procedural safeguards, but would formally classify him as detained. You are the treating psychiatrist.",
