        "vignette": "In the ICU, a 58-year-old man with longstanding diabetes is recovering from severe pneumonia but has developed acute kidney failure on top of chronic kidney disease. The nephrology team recommends starting continuous dialysis through a large catheter because his labs show worsening toxin buildup and electrolyte abnormalities despite maximal medical therapy, but the treatment would require a central line, anticoagulation, and likely light sedation because he repeatedly tries to remove IVs. He is awake, can describe the situation in his own words, and says he understands he could die without dialysis; he insists he does not want “machines” again after a traumatic prior hospitalization and asks the team to stop pushing and let him rest. Staff are divided on whether his fluctuating attention is enough to question his decision-making capacity and whether waiting risks an irreversible decline. The ICU attending must decide how to proceed tonight.",
