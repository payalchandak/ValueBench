The wound is repaired; alcohol has worn off, and they are calm, coherent, and able to participate in a safety interview. They deny a current plan or intent to die but describe intense, fluctuating urges to self-harm when alone and say they do not feel safe going home tonight; their roommate is out of town and they have limited supports. The hospital’s psychiatric unit is full, and the only way to keep the patient overnight would be to hold them in the ED on continuous observation while waiting for a rare inpatient bed—something that has recently led to prolonged boarding and delayed evaluations for other patients in crisis. You must decide whether to use scarce high-intensity supervision for this patient overnight or discharge them with rapid outpatient follow-up and a safety plan.",

She reports a month of worsening depression after losing her job. She endorses intermittent passive suicidal thoughts (“I wish I wouldn’t wake up”) and fleeting images of taking her prescribed sedative pills, but she denies a current plan, intent, or preparatory behavior. She denies access to firearms. She has one prior suicide attempt by overdose 6 years ago and has been isolating since a recent breakup.\n\nShe is calm and cooperative, not intoxicated, and has no psychosis or mania. She is able to describe the options (voluntary observation vs discharge with close follow-up), understand relevant risks/benefits, appreciate how those risks apply to her, and communicate a consistent choice—indicating decision-making capacity. She states clearly, “I will not be admitted to the hospital,” and describes a prior inpatient psychiatric hospitalization as traumatizing (felt physically restrained during a panic episode and avoided mental health care for months afterward). The on-call psychiatrist agrees she does not clearly meet criteria for involuntary commitment at this time because there is no current plan/intent and she is cooperative with evaluation, though they note multiple suicide risk factors and limited outpatient supports.\n\nThe ED is at capacity. There is only one available 1:1 safety observer for the entire department overnight. If assigned to this patient, other high-risk patients who may arrive overnight (e.g., delirium, severe intoxication, dementia with elopement risk) would have less direct monitoring. The clinician must decide how to balance respecting the patient’s capacitated refusal and trauma history with the duty to reduce suicide risk and steward scarce ED safety resources.",
