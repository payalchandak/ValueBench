      "source_text": "CASE 89:\nMEDICALISATION OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE\nToby is 6 and has been referred by his GP to the child development centre as his school has\nexpressed concerns over his lack of social interaction and mild speech problems. The refer-\nral letter describes him as being ‘a happy, friendly child most of the time but who can have\nperiods of agitation in some situations. He has a few close friends at school but struggles with\nlarger group activities. He also likes to know the times of breaks and lunch and struggles if\nthese are delayed. He is progressing well in most areas of learning but we have noticed that he\ndoes not engage in conversation with others and rarely initiates questions. He has a special\ninterest in sports cars and can talk about this happily for long periods of time.’\nToby has been brought to the clinic by his parents. They too have noticed that Toby’s behav-\niour is different from his peers. They say that they first noticed this around 2 years of age as he\nwould prefer to play alone than with others at nursery and would also have repetitive speech\nand movements. They say that he has mainly grown out of these but that if he faces signifi-\ncant changes to his routine he will get agitated and start flapping his hands. His parents are\nnot concerned about his behaviour and feel that he is doing well at school. Although they are\naware he is different they do not see how assigning him a ‘label’ will benefit him.\nQuestions\n• When does a spectrum of normality become an illness?\n• Who should make decisions about a child’s health if the parents do not have any\nconcerns?",
