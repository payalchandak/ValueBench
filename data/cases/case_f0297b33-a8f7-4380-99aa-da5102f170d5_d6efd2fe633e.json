      "source_text": "CASE 50:\nCONFLICT IN TREATMENT AIMS\nJohn is a 56-year-old university lecturer. He has been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer\nand has been admitted to an oncology ward to receive intensive radiotherapy. John also had\nan episode of psychosis in his 20s which required him to be sectioned under the Mental\nHealth Act. Fortunately, following this episode he has remained well and has had a very\nsuccessful career. His main concern when learning of his cancer diagnosis was that he would\nnot get a chance to finish the current projects he was currently involved with at the university,\nincluding setting up a bursary.\nShortly after arriving on the oncology ward to commence radiotherapy he began display-\ning signs of psychosis. He had flight of ideas and pressured speech and was quite agitated.\nMultiple investigations ruled out a physical cause for these new symptoms, and in light of his\nprevious medical history oral antipsychotic medication was started.\nOver the next few days his mental state worsened. He began making abusive phone calls to\nhis family, removing his oxygen, telling ward staff he was cured of his cancer and that he was\nbeing awarded a Nobel prize. Whilst happy to continue with his radiotherapy, John stopped\ntaking the antipsychotic medication prescribed by the psychiatrist. He was aware of some of\nthe detrimental effects of his psychosis, but denied he needed medicine to resolve it and was\nadamant he just needed to be left in peace so that he could focus on his university work.\nAs an articulate, intelligent man, John had insight that some of his beliefs and behaviours\nwere characteristic of psychosis and hid them from the doctors; he denied saying he was\ncured of cancer when confronted by the consultant looking after him. His consultant is\nconcerned – he is reluctant to continue giving radiotherapy in light of his worsening mental\nhealth, but delaying treatment for his cancer may ultimately hasten disease progression.\nQuestions\n• Is it more important for John to stay on the oncology ward and receive radiotherapy\nor be sectioned and treated for his psychosis?\n• Who should be involved in this decision?",

Within days he becomes increasingly agitated with pressured speech and grandiose beliefs. Medical workup does not show a reversible cause. Psychiatry prescribes an oral antipsychotic, but he refuses it after reading about side effects. He insists he feels “clear” and wants uninterrupted radiotherapy so he can finish major work projects. He intermittently removes his oxygen and makes hostile calls to family. He can be charming and minimizes symptoms during medical rounds, but nursing staff report escalating disorganization overnight. Tomorrow’s radiotherapy slot is the last available for a week, and he may soon require sedation for safety, which would prevent participation in decisions.

        "vignette": "A 56-year-old man with inoperable lung cancer is hospitalized to start an intensive course of radiotherapy meant to relieve worsening cough and shortness of breath and to slow local tumor growth. He has a remote history of psychosis. Over several days he develops insomnia, pressured speech, and expansive, sometimes paranoid ideas. No clear reversible medical trigger is identified so far. He refuses any antipsychotic after reading about side effects and describing a prior episode of severe stiffness and confusion on a similar drug. He can accurately explain the purpose and main risks of radiotherapy and consistently says he wants treatment, but the team determines he lacks stable capacity to consent because his decision-making fluctuates and he does not fully appreciate how his nighttime disorganization and impulsivity could disrupt safe delivery. If he moves during immobilization, radiation could be mistargeted and cause avoidable injury to healthy tissue. He has not been violent and can cooperate with immobilization when calm, but he has tried to leave the unit and repeatedly calls family in escalating conflict. Tomorrow’s slot is the only opening before a weeklong machine shutdown; if missed, the plan must be rescheduled and his symptoms may worsen. If an involuntary hold is used, he would likely require medication over objection, with a meaningful risk of recurrent severe rigidity or delirium. Hospital policy and applicable law allow either approach in this gray zone.",
