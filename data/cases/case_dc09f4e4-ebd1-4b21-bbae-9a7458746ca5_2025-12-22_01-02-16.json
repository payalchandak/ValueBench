On arrival he was tachypneic with Kussmaul respirations and dehydrated. After 8 hours of IV insulin and fluids, he is improved but not yet out of DKA: venous pH is 7.12, bicarbonate 10 mEq/L, anion gap 18 (down from 30), and serum beta‑hydroxybutyrate remains elevated; urine ketones are still positive. Nurses report he has intermittent confusion—at times he asks to go home “because I already got the insulin shot,” then minutes later says he never received any treatment. He repeatedly removes his IV and telemetry leads.\n\nLate morning, he insists on leaving against medical advice because he needs to pick up his 4-year-old from daycare. The team conducts a focused capacity assessment. He can state his name and the date but cannot consistently explain what DKA is, why IV insulin must continue until the anion gap closes, or the likely consequences of stopping treatment; when asked to repeat back the risks, he alternates between “I’ll be fine, I’ll just drink water” and “I could die, but I have to go anyway,” and he cannot describe a feasible plan to obtain insulin or get to follow-up. Social work and nursing offer to call the daycare, contact family/friends for childcare, arrange a hospital phone call, and explore emergency childcare resources; he refuses to provide contacts and declines these options, saying staff are “trying to trap” him.
