She misses the vein on the first attempt and whilst trying\nagain the patient moves his arm away and she stabs the end of the cannula in her finger. The\nnurse washes her wound out for 10 minutes under running water and then goes to speak to\nthe sister in charge about the needlestick injury policy.\n\nScenario 2\nA homosexual man presents to his GP over a period of months with multiple different infec-\ntions. The first few occasions he is treated with antibiotics or antifungals. On his fourth\nappointment he expresses concern that he keeps getting ill and has lost a bit of weight. He\nwould like to know whether there is anything else causing these infections other than being\nbusy and having a stressful job with a poor work–life balance. The GP agrees to do some\nblood tests but does not elaborate on what she is testing for.\n\nScenario 3\nA 24-year-old male has attended his local A&E department following a minor injury on a\nnight out. He thinks he may have broken his ankle and is requesting an X-ray. The triage\nnurse also mentions that they are doing routine HIV screening for every A&E attendee and\nwould like to know whether he would like a test.\n\nQuestions\n• What should be done in the above scenarios?\n• Should specific consent be needed for HIV testing?",
