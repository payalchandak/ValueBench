She is surprised when the health visitor says\nthat she will be given food vouchers if she tries to breastfeed her baby for 3 months.\nJames has had schizophrenia for 15 years. His compliance with medication is variable. He is\noffered a chance to take part in a programme whereby he will be paid £10 for each injection\nof depot antipsychotic.\nA council-run weight loss programme is offering reduced membership to the local gym\nfor people who have a BMI of more than 35 and who commit to a weight loss and fitness\nprogramme for 6 months.\nRoger is a sexual health consultant with responsibility for a local hostel for women who\nare sex workers. A number of them do not use contraception effectively, which results in\npregnancy and increased abortion rates. Roger wants to encourage the women to come to\na talk about depot contraception which he thinks would be an effective strategy to prevent\npregnancy, in addition to using barrier methods. He offers lunch vouchers and toiletries to\nencourage their attendance at the talk.\nEwan is a heroin addict and is enrolled in a drug rehabilitation programme where he is being\nprescribed Subutex. His local drugs clinic is offering him a £10 shopping voucher if he can\nprovide a clean urine sample at a weekly meeting with his key worker.\nQuestions\n• What are the ethical concerns if incentives are offered to encourage healthy lifestyle\nchoices and compliance with medical treatments?\n• Do incentives effectively coerce consent?",

        "vignette": "A 38-year-old man with schizophrenia is admitted after stopping medication and developing paranoid beliefs. With inpatient treatment, his thinking clears. He demonstrates decision-making capacity and can compare oral and long-acting injectable (LAI) antipsychotics. He understands relapse risk if medication is stopped. He prefers to avoid daily pills but is ambivalent about injections. He is behind on rent and says a cash-equivalent voucher at each LAI visit would likely affect what he chooses. The community clinic offers modest vouchers contingent on attending scheduled LAI appointments. Clinic tracking suggests the program improves attendance and reduces relapse-related readmissions. Staff worry incentives may feel coercive to financially stressed patients and could trigger mistrust and refusal of follow-up. Without adherence support, missed injections could quickly lead to relapse and rehospitalization. Funding limits the program to a small number of patients, and enrollment must be initiated at discharge today.",
