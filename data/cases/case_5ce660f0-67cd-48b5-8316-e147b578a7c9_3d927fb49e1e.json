      "source_text": "CASE 16:\nNEONATAL CARE: LEGAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES\nYou are working as an ST2 in a neonatal intensive care unit. You and your consultant are\ncalled to the delivery of baby Ayesha, who has just been born at 25 weeks following a normal\npregnancy. When you arrive, she is not breathing spontaneously and has a slow heart rate.\nShe is intubated and ventilated and requires a brief period of cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nFollowing this, she is able to be stabilised on the ventilator and is transferred to the neonatal\nunit. Although she appears reasonably stable over the next 48 hours, a cranial ultrasound\nscan shows large bleeds into her brain (bilateral grade IV intra-ventricular haemorrhages).\nYour consultant has a meeting with the family and explains that the likely impact of the\nbleeding is that Ayesha will be very severely disabled, with severe four-limb cerebral palsy,\ncognitive impairment and potentially visual and hearing impairment. He explains that she is\nunlikely to be able to breathe on her own at the moment, and that it may well be in her best\ninterests to remove her from the ventilator and withdraw intensive support rather than pro-\nlonging her suffering. Her parents are horrified by the idea that medical treatment could be\nwithdrawn from their child and are adamant that she continues to be ventilated. They have\nstrong religious beliefs, maintain that only God can decide when someone should die and are\npraying for a miracle to make her recover. Ayesha is their only child, her mother is 42 years\nold and this baby was much longed for after years of trying to conceive. They understand that\nshe is likely to be disabled but could not countenance ending her life and think that her life\nwill still be worthwhile if she is very severely impaired. The treating team feel it is wrong to\nprolong Ayesha’s suffering by continuing to ventilate her and to perform invasive and painful\nprocedures when her brain is known to be so severely damaged. Even if she might manage to\nbreathe on her own when she is a few days or weeks older, some think it would be kinder to\nwithdraw intensive care now, given how severely brain damaged she is likely to be.",

Over 48 hours she remains physiologically stable but needs ongoing ventilation and frequent invasive procedures. Cranial ultrasound shows bilateral grade IV intraventricular hemorrhages. The neonatology team explains that survival, if achieved, is expected to involve profound neurologic impairment and prolonged dependence on intensive care. Her parents, citing deeply held religious beliefs and years of infertility, insist that ventilation and all life-sustaining treatment continue and ask the team to “give her every chance.” Several clinicians believe ongoing intensive care is causing suffering with little prospect of an acceptable outcome and propose transitioning to comfort-focused care.
