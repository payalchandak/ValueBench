      "source_text": "The case of Miss A\nMiss A su ered from borderline personality dis-\nff order. In childhood, she had experienced pro-\nlonged and extensive sexual abuse by her\nfather. As a result, she su ered from depression,\nff and intermittent feelings of loathing towards her\nown body, which resulted in acts of deliberate\nself-harm and episodes of self-starvation. She\nwas admitted to a psychiatric hospital and over\na long period of time developed a reasonable\nrelationship with her male psychiatrist, who was\nfi concerned for her welfare.\nDuring one admission (after a period of\nyears), Miss A s weight began to drop so dramat-\n’ ically that her doctor threatened to force-feed\nher in order to save her life. She went to court to\nget an injunction to prevent him from doing so.\nThe dilemma here for both the patient and the\ndoctor is obvious. Respecting her autonomy may\nresult in her acting so riskily to herself that she\nsu ers harm, and dies.\nff It may be relevant when contemplating this\ndilemma to consider how force-feeding is a\nsymbolic re-enactment of the original abuse\n(she was subjected to forced fellatio over a\nperiod of time). The experience of child abuse\nfrequently leaves individuals with real concerns\nabout the extent to which they are in control\nof their own bodies even if retaining control\nincurs risk.\nA relevant issue is that of Miss A s self con-\n’ cept, i.e. her attitudes of herself towards herself\n(Attanucci, 1988). Her own ambivalence about\n‘ ’ . . . ’ herself ( I don t matter I do matter ) was\nff mirrored in the attitudes of sta , who alterna-\ntively saw her as incompetent to care for herself\nand needing to be force-fed; or as manipulative\nand trying to bully them. This mirroring also\nreplicated the relationship between herself\nand her parents. Legal argument focused on\nher competence to make decisions and refuse\nhelp (but that will not be examined here).\nOn a rights/principles perspective, or even a\nutilitarian analysis, there is a tension between\n’ Miss A s view of what was right for her, and the\nsta s view. A broader view of her welfare,\nff’ which included thinking about her past, and\npresent relationships with caretakers, might\nunderstand the dilemma as part of the concern\nthat abused adults have about their control\nover their own bodies. By supporting her at\nthese times when she was at her most self-\ndestructive, it might be more possible to under-\nstand her self-destruction (and thus her ethical\nfl con ict with sta ) as a response to her own\nff previous experiences of abuse. Time could also\nbe o ered to sta to explore their feelings\nff ff about Miss A, which might help to reduce the\nfl tension between them, and help them to feel\nless threatened by Miss A s expression of\n’ autonomy.",

She has a long history of childhood sexual abuse and describes eating as “losing control” of her body. Over the past several days she has taken only sips of water and has become weak and dizzy. She is calm and coherent. She repeats that she understands she could die and says she would rather risk that than be “made to eat.” The medical team believes she is nearing a point where urgent feeding will be needed to prevent irreversible injury. Forced nutrition would require a nasogastric tube with restraint and sedation, which she fears will feel like an assault and could rupture the therapeutic relationship.

        "vignette": "A 29-year-old woman with borderline personality disorder and severe depression is on an inpatient psychiatric unit for worsening non-suicidal self-injury and several weeks of marked food restriction. For days she has taken only sips of water. She clearly and repeatedly refuses oral supplements, IV fluids, and artificial nutrition. She is weak with orthostatic symptoms and bradycardia. Labs and ECG show dehydration and emerging electrolyte abnormalities. Medicine is co-managing due to concern for arrhythmia and refeeding complications if nutrition resumes abruptly. She understands that continued refusal can lead to serious organ injury or death. She requests that the team honor her refusal and not use a feeding tube. She fears that restraint and sedation would be retraumatizing given a childhood trauma history and could cause complications such as aspiration or injury during restraint. Two psychiatrists disagree on whether her depression and trauma-driven weighing of risks leaves her decision-making capacity intact. Ethics and legal counsel confirm that, given borderline capacity and imminent but non-emergent risk, either approach fits policy under state law and a court order is not feasible today. A plan must be set now because monitoring alone will not prevent further decline if she continues to refuse intake.",
