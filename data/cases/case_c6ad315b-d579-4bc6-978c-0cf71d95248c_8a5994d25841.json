      "source_text": "Case 13-3\nThe Required State Psychiatric Diagnosis Record\nFor Andrew Gorly, it was the second admission to the Brooklyn Psychiatric\nClinic. The patient had been subdued on the corner of Rose and Belmont\nStreets. He claimed that the Nazis were infiltrating the Political Science De-\npartment of the university where he was a graduate student. The patient\nhad, that afternoon, assaulted three innocent passersby, whom he accused\nof being part of the conspiracy. Mr. Gorly was scheduled to take his doc-\ntoral examination the coming Tuesday. He had been up for three consecu-\ntive nights reading modern European political history, cramming for one of\nhis exams. After completing the exams and writing his dissertation, the\npatient was planning on a career in the foreign service. His professors had\nalways thought of him as a bit strange but considered him one of the bright\nyoung scholars in the department. They had tried to persuade him to go into\nteaching, but he was an activist; he still had faith that hard-working, intel-\nligent foreign service officers could do something to change American for-\neign policy.\nHis parents brought him to the Brooklyn Psychiatric Clinic late that eve-\nning. The diagnosis was an acute paranoid schizophrenic break. Dr. Andrew\nLyons, the psychiatrist on call, understood the extreme pressure of the\nexams. He confided to the parents that he thought the prognosis was good.\nHopefully, a short stay as an inpatient would get their son through the crisis.\nThe doctor administered 20 mg Ziprasidone intramuscularly and made\nappropriate notations on the chart. The patient, who was still present, in-\nsisted on knowing what was being written. Dr. Lyons explained. The doctor\nthen picked up the Admission Form. Mr. Gorly insisted on seeing the form,\nand Dr. Lyons obligingly gave him a blank copy. It was a standardized,\ncomputerized form giving the patient's name, address, Social Security\nnumber, occupation, and psychiatric history. It also included religion, edu-\ncation, weekly family income, a “problem appraisal,” and, most signifi-\ncantly, the psychiatric diagnosis written as the code.\n“You mean you are going to fill out this entire form so my whole life can\nbe fed into a computer?” the patient asked. “Where does the duplicate copy\ngo?” he demanded.\n“To the Department of Mental Hygiene in the state capital,” was the reply.\n“Do you realize what this does to my foreign service career when this\nreaches the government computer?”\nDr. Lyons said he was sure that the records were treated with strict\nconfidence. The records were needed for statistical purposes only. Cer-\ntainly they would not be turned over to the foreign service.\n“And why do my name, address, and Social Security number go on the\nform if it is only for statistical purposes?” the patient asked. “You can't just\nsend my name in. It violates my right to confidentiality.”\n“The law says I have to send in the form. It is part of a multi-state infor-\nmation system for psychiatric patients,” was the reply.",

After an initial dose of antipsychotic medication he is calmer, can describe his goals clearly, and repeatedly asks what is being documented. He learns that the hospital must submit a standardized admission report to a state mental health registry that includes his name, date of birth, and a diagnostic code, and he insists this not be filed because he fears it could be accessed later and damage his future career. The psychiatrist believes the information could help future clinicians quickly recognize relapse and avoid harmful delays or inappropriate treatment, but also recognizes the patient’s concern about privacy and downstream consequences if the information spreads beyond clinical use. The psychiatrist must decide what to do about the required report.",
