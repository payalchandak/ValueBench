Two years ago I developed renal failure after suffering from meningitis. I am very for-\ntunate that the doctors and nurses managed to save my life, but unfortunately my kidneys\ndid not recover and need dialysis three times a week. I have been told that my life expec-\ntancy will be shortened unless I undergo a t ransplant, and so I am now looking for someone\nto donate a kidney. Are you that kind, generous person who could help save my life?\nQuestions\n• Is it lawful for someone to advertise for an organ donor?\n• Is it ethically appropriate for a stranger to donate an organ to someone they ‘met’\nthrough social media?",

She is increasingly exhausted by treatments and has had repeated access problems, but she is still medically eligible for transplant. She posts on social media asking for a living kidney donor. A healthy adult who lives several states away contacts her and offers to donate, saying there is no expectation of payment or ongoing relationship. They have only communicated online, and the offer has drawn public attention and supportive comments that may make the donor feel committed. You are her nephrologist and can refer the donor to your center’s living-donor program.

She is listed for a deceased-donor transplant, but she is highly sensitized and may wait years for an offer. A timely living-donor transplant would substantially improve survival and quality of life compared with continued dialysis. She has explicitly asked to proceed with evaluation of a specific volunteer donor she found through social media. A healthy adult from several states away volunteers. The donor recently lost a job and has received extensive online praise. In private messages the donor asks that the evaluation be kept hidden from family. The donor does not agree to disclosure or safeguards to rule out coercion or financial inducement and hints that supporters might help with travel costs. Your center can screen unrelated directed donors. It must either start the full evaluation during the donor’s one available visit next week or decline and close the referral. The evaluation slot would displace another donor workup this month. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach.",
