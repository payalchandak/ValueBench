      "source_text": "Case 17-3\nCanterbury v. Spence and the Reasonable-Person\nConsent Standard\nJerry Canterbury, age 19, was a clerk typist for the Federal Bureau of Inves-\ntigation. He suffered severe back pain for which, in December of 1958, he\nconsulted two general practitioners. When the medication they prescribed\ndid not resolve his problems, he consulted a neurosurgeon, Dr. William\nSpence. When x-rays did not reveal the problem, he proposed a myelogram\nduring which a dye would be injected into the spinal column to help visual-\nize any abnormality.\nBased on the myelogram, a rupured disk was suspected, and, in February\nof 1959, a laminectomy was performed to which his mother consented\n(apparently after the operation was over) because Canterbury was a minor.\nAfter the procedure, Dr. Spence told him to stay in bed while voiding, but\nthe orders were changed (it is unclear by whom), indicating he should get\nout of bed to urinate. Hospital personnel gave him a receptacle in which\nto void and left him unattended. Canterbury slipped off the side of the bed\nand fell to the floor. Later that day he complained of difficulty breathing\nand inability to move his legs. Dr. Spence recommended a second opera-\ntion to correct the problem, but Canterbury was left incontinent and with\nparalysis of his bowels and hobbled about on crutches. In June of 1962 he\nhad to resign from the FBI for health reasons.\nIn March of 1963 Canterbury filed suit in the United States District Court\nagainst Dr. Spence and the Washington Hospital Center claiming negligence\nin performing the operation and failure to inform him of the risks. After a di-\nrected verdict in favor of the doctor and hospital, Canterbury appealed to the\nfederal Court of Appeals. In addressing the consent issues, that court noted\nthat many jurisdictions rely on “the custom of physicians practicing in the\ncommunity to make the particular disclosure to the patient.” This court, how-\never, adopted a different standard. After rejecting the notion that there must\nbe “full” disclosure, the court held that the physician must disclose every-\nthing that the patient would need to know in making the decision for the\ntherapy, that is, everything that is “material to the decision.” This standard\nis independent of the practice of physicians in the community. It is what\nhas come to be called “the reasonable-man” or later “the personable-person”\nstandard. The case was then sent back to the lower court to determine\nwhether those pieces of information had been adequately disclosed.",

CT suggests a possible large disk herniation, but the level is unclear. Radiology can perform a myelogram only this afternoon. An OR slot is reserved for tomorrow if results show compressive disease. If today’s slot is missed, repeat testing and surgery will be delayed for weeks, with a risk of progressive or irreversible neurologic deficit. The patient can describe the purpose, alternatives, and that he may choose to wait, and he appears to have decision-making capacity. He becomes acutely panicked when rare catastrophic complications are discussed, and this predictably makes him want to stop or postpone the study. He repeatedly asks you not to list “worst-case” outcomes and says he wants to proceed today. You know myelography and decompression are commonly performed but can rarely cause permanent neurologic injury, including paralysis. Risk management advises that either a full material-risk discussion or a documented patient-limited disclosure is legally permissible, but clinicians disagree. You must obtain consent now.",
