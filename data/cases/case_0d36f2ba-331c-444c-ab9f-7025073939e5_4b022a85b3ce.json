      "source_text": "Case 12-2\nObesity: Medical Problem or Lifestyle Choice?\nLuke Braddock is a 64-year-old black man. He has been employed at the\nsame job as a professional accountant for three decades and plans on retir-\ning within the next year. He is in good health except that he is 5’9” tall and\nweighs 240 pounds. That makes his body mass index (BMI) 35.4 and makes\nhim obese according to the National Institutes of Health. According to the\nnewly revised American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual 5 (DSM-5) he has the disease of obesity.\nHe sees his internist, Dr. McCubbin, at his health maintenance organi-\nzation (HMO) yearly, and once again this year Dr. McCubbin points out his\nweight and urges him to follow a better diet and get more exercise. Other\nthan his obesity, Mr. Braddock is healthy. His lipids and blood pressure are\nwithin the normal range. (He is on a statin, which helps with the lipids.) He\nhas gout, but no other significant medical issues. He has never smoked and\nwalks a mile a day at least five days a week.\nMr. Braddock's weight has been stable for over 20 years. The continual\nexpressions of concern about his weight from his internist and his wife have\nled him to pay attention to the literature on obesity. He knows that higher\nBMI levels generally correlate with mortality and morbidity risks. He found\na publication referring to the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) for the year 2000 that estimated 111,909 excess deaths\nfrom obesity (BMI greater than 30). On the other hand, he found tremen-\ndous variation in the articles he had read. Particularly with older patients,\nthe correlations seem variable. For example, in one article he read, for\nblack subjects, death risk actually was lower for people in the BMI range\nof 25-28 than it was for those in the 23.5-24.9 range. Moreover, even\nthough death risk increased at higher BMI ranges, even in the highest\ngroup the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, even though\nthere were detrimental effects at the highest BMI ranges, the time lost\nfrom obesity was small for older persons, measured in months or, at\nmost, a year or two, and for older blacks higher BMI actually produced a\ngain in years of life.\nMr. Braddock’s conclusion was that his obesity was a real, but proba-\nbly a small risk. Given his generally good health, his avoidance of smok-\ning, and the rather small and variable effects on longevity for older people,\nhe decided that the mortality gain from getting his weight down was prob-\nably real, but small. He understood the morbidity risks—diabetes, joint\nproblems, and so forth—but was not convinced that the effort to reduce\nhis risk was worth it. He gained great pleasure out of eating and enjoyed\nregular weekend gatherings with his grown son and daughters and their\nfamilies for elaborate traditional meals or barbecues. In addition, he found\nexercise beyond his regular walking terribly boring and, in a strange way,\na kind of offensive social conformity.",

        "vignette": "A 64-year-old man with long-standing obesity (BMI in the mid-30s) comes for his annual visit. He has gout and hyperlipidemia controlled on a statin. Screening labs now show glucose levels in the prediabetes range. He has no known cardiovascular disease. He says he enjoys family meals and does not want frequent tracking, restrictive dieting, or a medicalized daily routine. He says he does not want to enroll in an intensive program or start a new medication today. At the same time, he is worried about developing diabetes and asks what you would do if you were his doctor. Your HMO offers a bundled benefit that requires starting an anti-obesity medication and enrolling in an intensive weight-management program. Enrollment closes at the end of today’s visit and cannot be reopened after he retires and changes insurance. Without additional weight-loss treatment, his risk of progression to diabetes and later cardiovascular disease may increase. The medication could reduce weight and cardiometabolic risk but can cause nausea, constipation, and occasionally dehydration, gallbladder disease, or pancreatitis. It also requires frequent follow-up visits. He has decision-making capacity, and either approach is legally permissible with informed consent. You must decide how to proceed today.",
