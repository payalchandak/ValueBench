      "source_text": "Case 16-1\nChemotherapy Risks: Is Going without Chemotherapy a Benefit?\nLaurie DeSoto, a 16-year-old girl who had recently been diagnosed with\nleukemia, came to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic with her mother to dis-\ncuss treatment options with Dr. Elizabeth Holmes, the oncologist who had\nassumed responsibility for her care when she was referred to the clinic.\nSeveral different chemotherapy regimens were under consideration, but\nDr. Holmes thought Laurie might be an ideal candidate for a research pro-\ntocol now under way at the clinic.\nThe protocol involved a standard four-drug regimen that had been\nused successfully for Laurie's type of leukemia for several years. The origi-\nnal regimen required patients to be on the drugs for five years. After consid-\nerable experience with this drug schedule, oncologists began to suspect\nthat the patients on it did not need to continue the drug for five years. The\ndata from long experience showed that three years was just as effective\nas judged by the percentage of patients who remained leukemia-free for\nfive years. The three-year regimen was now the standard. It was used\nwidely in oncology programs throughout the United States and elsewhere.\nOn the basis of that experience, Dr. Holmes and several colleagues\nbegan to wonder whether two years on the regimen might be as effective.\nThey realized that the adolescents taking the drug had to endure the side\neffects of the chemotherapy—the nausea, hair loss, and other effects—and\nwould appreciate having to stay on the regimen only two years rather\nthan three. On the other hand, if they were wrong, it would mean that some\npatients taken off the regimen after the shorter period might have recur-\nrence of their disease—a terrible, potentially fatal result.\nDr. Holmes had become the principal investigator of a new research\nprotocol that would randomize patients to receiving either the now-standard\nthree-year regimen or to an experimental group that received exactly the\nsame drug combination but for only two years. It was based on preliminary\nevidence from several clinical cases in which, for various reasons, patients\nhad stopped the treatment after two years and had not had recurrence of\ntheir leukemia. The protocol had to be approved by the hospital IRB, the\ngroup charged with protecting human subjects of research.\nOne of the criteria for approval was that the risks to subjects were\nreasonable and were justified by the potential benefits. The review board,\nafter considerable discussion, voted, by an eight-to-two margin, that the\nrisks were reasonably balanced. In other words, the majority of the board\nthought that the small risk of greater chance of recurrence of the leukemia\nwas justified by the benefits to the youngsters who received the shorter\ntwo-year regimen.\nDr. Holmes now decided to present the opportunity to enter this proto-\ncol to Laurie DeSoto and her mother. If they agreed to enter the study, Laurie\nwould be assigned randomly to either a standard three-year regimen or\nan experimental two-year treatment. Although subjects of research are\nnormally “blinded,” that is, kept ignorant of which treatment arm they\nenter, in this case that would not be possible since patients and physicians\nwould clearly know whether they were receiving the treatment for three\nyears or two. If the investigators and the IRB believe that the risks and\nbenefits are more or less equally balanced between the two groups, such\nrandomization is considered morally acceptable. When two treatment arms\nin a research protocol are perceived as being equally balanced in their\nrisks and benefits, the study is said to be in equipoise.'* Since Dr. Holmes\nand the IRB agreed that the risks were evenly balanced, they considered\nthe offer to be randomized morally justified.\nDr. Holmes presented the study to Laurie and her mother, including the\nfact that, if they agreed to enter the study, they would be randomly as-\nsigned to either three years or two years of treatment. After being given an\nopportunity to ask any questions, Mrs. DeSoto signed the consent form on\nbehalf of Laurie. Laurie, as a minor, could not give her own consent, but\nwas nevertheless asked to give her “assent,” which she gave. This amounts\nto approval even though it is not based on a level of understanding and\nvoluntariness that we would expect from an adult.\nDr. Holmes, having received documented consent, left the room and\nsoon returned with the news that Laurie had been randomly assigned to\nthe three-year arm, that is, the existing standard treatment. To her sur-\nprise, Laurie burst into tears. When asked, she explained she really\nwanted the two-year treatment course. She hated the thought of the side\neffects, especially the hair loss. She did not want to look strange for any\nlonger than necessary. She sobbed in her mother’s arms as Dr. Holmes\nlooked on.",

        "vignette": "A 16-year-old with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieved remission after induction and consolidation and is starting maintenance therapy. An IRB-approved trial at the center randomizes patients to two commonly used maintenance durations (2 years vs 3 years) with identical drugs/doses. Clinicians disagree whether the extra year meaningfully lowers relapse risk or mainly adds cumulative toxicity and disrupts adolescent development. The mother gave permission and the patient assented; randomization assigned 3 years. The patient says she would not have agreed if she knew she could be assigned longer treatment and now strongly prefers 2 years because fatigue, nausea, frequent visits, and infection precautions are straining school and friendships despite supportive care. The clinician worries that insisting on 3 years could damage trust and adherence, but also worries that withdrawing after randomization could weaken a trial the team relies on to answer the question. State law and hospital policy permit either continuing or withdrawing from research. Pharmacy needs orders finalized before the next cycle.",
