      "source_text": "The case of Mr A\nMr A is a 72-year-old retired railway conductor who lives with his wife in the house of their 43-year-old daughter and her family. Still active on the family smallholding, he is increasingly frustrated by difficulties in operating machinery and in finding his way about the house. Accompanied by his wife and daughter, he visited Dr B’s clinic for memory disturbance, where he was diagnosed with hypertension, arteriosclerotic occlusive disease, and multiple subcortical perivascular lesions on a computer scan of his brain. The overall diagnosis was subcortical vascular dementia with a moderate degree of impairment. It emerged that Mr A also had considerable impairment of his short-term memory (e.g. telephone numbers) and long-term recall (e.g. names of old friends). However, he denied strenuously that his mental powers were in any way impaired.\nIn the course of the consultation, Dr B asked Mr A whether he drove a car. Mr A replied that he did, and Dr B warned him that he should stop, from a medical point of view – because of his memory impairment.\nMr A absolutely refused to consider stopping: he was in perfectly good health, he insisted, and still very fit.\n'I’m a lot better driver than all those young lunatics!'\nMr A’s daughter interrupted at this point to describe two small car accidents which her father had recently caused. Mr A then announced, out of the blue, that he had just decided to buy a new car. If there was any problem, it lay in the old car, not in his driving.\nAnd there the matter rested, at least in the doctor’s consultation.\nPrivately Mr A’s wife and daughter agreed between themselves that the only possible solution was to hide the car keys. But Mr A managed to locate them, and drove off to a reunion of his railway colleagues without any incident. When he returned, it was with a new copy of the car keys, and a bad mood that lasted for days at home. Mr A’s wife has now lost any will to prevent her husband from driving: she can’t bear his anger, she says, and in any case he was perfectly all right last time he drove. Perhaps he doesn’t have dementia after all, she remarked to the doctor on her own next visit to his surgery.\n(Hope, 1997)",
