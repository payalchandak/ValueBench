She is now admitted with severe hyperkalemia and worsening uremic symptoms; the nephrology team believes urgent dialysis is the most reliable way to stabilize her, but it would require placement of a dialysis catheter and transfer to a monitored setting, with a real chance she could deteriorate during the procedure and clinicians would normally perform chest compressions or intubation.
