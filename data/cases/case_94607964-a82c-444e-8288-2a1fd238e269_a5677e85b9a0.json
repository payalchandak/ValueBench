      "source_text": "CASE 48:\nAPPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT UNDER THE\nMENTAL HEALTH ACT\nRobson is in his 40s and has paranoid schizophrenia. He has been assessed to lack capacity\nwith respect to decision making about treatment for his condition. Over the past 20 years he\nhas been detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (MHA 1983, as amended 2007)\nmany times but has never gained insight into his illness and has not engaged with treatment.\nHe is currently detained at an inpatient unit. In the past and during his current admission he\nhas been treated with a depot antipsychotic medication which is administered by an injection\nevery 2 weeks, but because he resists, he needs to be restrained to administer the injection.\nThe treating team considers that the current depot medication prevents his mental state\nfrom deteriorating. However, they are now considering whether to try clozapine, which\nis recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to treat\npatients with ‘treatment-resistant’ schizophrenia, i.e., if they have not responded to two\ndifferent a ntipsychotic medications. Clozapine would have to be administered orally, and\nRobson would have to have regular blood tests to monitor him as the treatment has serious\nand potentially fatal side effects. The team hopes that this new medication may result in an\nimprovement in Robson’s mental health and enables him to gain insight into his condition,\nthus promoting engagement with his treatment plan.\nQuestion\n• Should a person be compulsorily detained under the MHA if the treatment provided\ndoes not improve his mental condition?",

He has lacked decision-making capacity for treatment decisions across multiple admissions. A long-acting depot antipsychotic has kept him from becoming acutely psychotic, but every injection requires several staff to physically restrain him. He has developed persistent stiffness and tremor, and he becomes more agitated after each restraint episode. The team is considering switching to clozapine. It might reduce his symptoms more than his current regimen, but it requires daily oral dosing and frequent blood tests to monitor for rare, life-threatening complications. He refuses tablets and venipuncture and would likely need restraint for both. Hospital policy and mental health law allow either approach when he lacks capacity and is detained. His next injection is due tomorrow, so a plan is needed now.",

Despite dose reductions and adjuncts for extrapyramidal symptoms, he has progressive rigidity and tremor and new involuntary facial movements concerning for tardive dyskinesia, which may worsen if the depot continues. After recent restraint episodes he had a fall. He has had adequate trials of two other antipsychotics, including another LAI, without sustained control or with intolerable adverse effects.
