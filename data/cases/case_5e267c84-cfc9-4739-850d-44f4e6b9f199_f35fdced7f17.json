Her left knee is now extremely painful, swollen and erythematous, and\nshe cannot bend her leg or weight bear. You suspect that she has a septic arthritis secondary to\nher knee injury.

You suspect septic arthritis, and orthopedics is available to aspirate the joint and start IV antibiotics tonight. When you explain the procedure, she is tearful and panicked. She interrupts, says she cannot think, and refuses anyone touching her knee. She answers some questions coherently but cannot repeat back the key risks of waiting versus treating, and she keeps changing her mind minute to minute. Sedation could make a capacity assessment harder, but untreated pain may be driving her inability to engage.
