      "source_text": "*. Case 15-2\n_ Insuring Off-Label Pain Relief\nMr. Horrigan, a Medicare beneficiary and veteran of the U.S. Navy, was se-\nverely injured in a tornado on March 29, 1997. He suffered severe craniofacial\ntrauma for which he underwent removal of his left eye, removal of portions of\nthe left frontal lobe of his brain, and extensive cranial facial reconstruction.\nAt the time of the injury, he was diagnosed with organic brain disease that\ncauses him to suffer from severe migraines. Shortly thereafter, he became eli-\ngible for Medicare on account of his disability. Since the tornado, Mr. Horrigan\nhas required pain medication to manage the incapacitating headaches that\ncause seizures when left untreated. As a result, he has developed a tolerance\nto pain medications, causing most pain killers to be ineffective in managing\nhis acute migraines. For six years, Mr. Horrigan was using Actig, which is\nindicated by the FDA to treat breakthrough pain in cancer patients, to\nmanage his migraines and reduce the risk of seizing. Before the enactment\nof Medicare Part D, Mr. Horrigan received coverage of his Actiq prescription\nunder the state Medicaid program, TennCare. Initially, when Medicare Part D\nwas enacted and Mr. Horrigan was forced to enroll in a Medicare prescrip-\ntion drug plan, Humana covered his Actiq prescription. In October 2006,\nhowever, Mr. Horrigan was suddenly told by his pharmacist that Humana\nwas denying coverage. Mr. Horrigan did not receive notice that his coverage\nwould change, nor did he receive a transitional supply. Because he could not\nafford to pay for his Actiq prescription out of pocket, Mr. Horrigan’s prescrib-\ning physician, Dr. B, prescribed Fentora, which is also indicated by the FDA\nto treat breakthrough pain in cancer patients, as a replacement for the Actiq.\nFentora has also proven to successfully ease Mr. Horrigan’s pain. Initially,\nHumana provided coverage of Mr. Horrigan’s Fentora prescription, but in\nJanuary 2007 ended this coverage without prior notification or transition\nfill. Because his Fentora prescription costs approximately $1,500 a month,\nMr. Horrigan cannot afford to pay for it out of pocket. As a result, he visits\nthe emergency room (ER) on a biweekly basis so that he can receive the\nmedication at the hospital and avoid suffering from a seizure caused by\nhis extremely severe pain. Maximus Federal Services has denied his\nappeal for Part D coverage, and MRC is representing him in his appeal for\nreview by an administrative law judge.®",

His Medicare drug plan now denies coverage for any rapid-onset fentanyl because he does not have cancer. He cannot pay out of pocket and has been coming to the emergency department repeatedly for rescue dosing. He is in your clinic today after another overnight visit. He says he will go back to the ER if he leaves without the medication.
