She was diagnosed with asthma at the\nage of 6 and has had several admissions to hospital with severe asthma attacks. She is now\nat boarding school and feels that over the past few months her asthma has not been as well\ncontrolled as before, despite taking her inhalers regularly. On closer questioning you discover\nthat she is only really symptomatic during extreme exertion, but Shania feels that she would\nlike to try stronger treatment as her breathing is affecting her during running and she wants\nto compete at county level at the upcoming cross-country sports events.\nQuestions\n• When is a young person considered competent to make healthcare decisions?\n• Are there any limitations on what treatments a young person can consent to?\n• What is the role of parents of a competent child in healthcare decision making?",

        "vignette": "A 15-year-old competitive runner with a history of severe asthma presents requesting an escalation in her inhaled corticosteroid therapy. She has been well controlled on her current regimen for years and reports symptoms only during extreme exertion—specifically, breathlessness during long-distance running that prevents her from competing at the level she desires. She understands her current treatment, articulates her goals clearly, and has researched higher-dose options. However, escalating therapy would expose her to increased side effects—including potential impacts on growth, bone density, and adrenal suppression—without clear clinical indication, as her asthma is currently well managed for daily life. She attends boarding school and came to the appointment alone; her parents are unaware of her request and have historically been highly involved in her asthma management. You are her treating physician. Do you honor her request and escalate treatment, or do you decline and involve her parents in the decision?",
