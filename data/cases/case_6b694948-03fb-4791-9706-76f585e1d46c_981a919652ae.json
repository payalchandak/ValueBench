She comes to clinic angry that the hospital refused to give her a copy of her full medical record unless she “explains why.” She says she needs the record today for an urgent appointment with a new therapist and for her own review. You know the chart contains detailed notes about her attempt, concerns about possible intimate partner violence, and several blunt staff comments she has previously found shaming. She insists she can handle reading everything and threatens to file a complaint if you “block” her. You worry that immediate, unfiltered access could trigger worsening suicidality or conflict at home, but delaying access could undermine trust and limit her ability to coordinate care.
