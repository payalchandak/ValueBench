During his stay in hospital he becomes very attached to one of the junior\ndoctors. He sees her every day on the ward round and she often stays to talk to him after tak-\ning his blood or changing his dressings. As John recovers he starts flirting with the doctor.\nShe is flattered and is finding more and more reason to stay and talk to him. While she is\nremoving the sutures from a scar on his face, he tells her that she is beautiful and tries to kiss\nher. Uncertain about what to do and her own feelings, the doctor leaves and avoids seeing\nJohn for a few days. However, when he is discharged a week later she gives him her number\nand says they should go out for a drink now that he is no longer an inpatient.\nQuestions\n• Is it appropriate for a doctor to have a relationship with a patient?\n• What should a doctor do if she is serious about having a relationship with a patient?\n• Are their situations where relationships would be inappropriate even if the thera-\npeutic relationship had ended?",

During suture removal he tries to kiss her. She feels conflicted and notices she is seeking reasons to visit his room. He is scheduled for discharge tomorrow, and key decisions about his pain regimen and wound follow-up must be finalized today.

        "vignette": "A 38-year-old man is recovering in the hospital after a motor vehicle crash with fractures and complex facial wounds. He needs frequent bedside wound care and a carefully structured opioid taper before discharge tomorrow. The inpatient resident has managed most of his pain adjustments and wound plans under the attending of record. During a painful dressing change yesterday, he made a sexualized comment and briefly reached for the resident’s hand; she stepped back, set limits, and documented the incident. He later apologized and remains cognitively intact without delirium. Today he refuses to review or sign discharge instructions with any clinician other than her. He becomes tearful and agitated when another clinician enters. The service is short-staffed. No senior clinician can co-manage, and the only alternate physician can assume care only if the resident has no further contact. If discharge planning is disrupted, he may leave without clear wound-care or taper instructions, risking withdrawal, uncontrolled pain, or wound infection and readmission. Keeping the resident involved requires a chaperone and ties up limited staff time needed for other patients. Discharge orders and home nursing referrals must be finalized by end of day. Risk management and the program director confirm that either a formal transfer or a time-limited supervised continuation is allowed under policy.",
