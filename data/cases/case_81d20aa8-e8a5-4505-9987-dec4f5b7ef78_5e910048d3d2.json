The patient has Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and will not likely improve. Over the last several months the patient has told you repeatedly that he does not want to be \"kept alive as a vegetable\" with artificial nutrition and hydration by any method. The health-care proxy form specifically states there is to be “no placement of a nasogastric or gastric tube for enteral feeding.” The health-care proxy agent is a nurse. The proxy insists that you have a jejunostomy (J-tube) placed for feeding telling you the proxy form only excludes the NG and G-tubes.\nWhat should you do?\na. Place the J-tube.\nb. Tell the proxy she needs to get a court order for the J-tube.\nc. Tell the proxy she needs an ethics committee evaluation.\nd. Do not place any form of tube for artificial nutrition or hydration.\ne.
