She has been referred to your surgical clinic by her GP as\nrecent genetic tests have revealed that Diane carries the BRCA 1 gene. These were performed\nby the local genetics department as her mum and older sister had both developed breast\ncancer in their 40s. Diane has come to request that you list her for surgery to remove both\nbreasts in an attempt to prevent her from developing breast cancer.\nYou have never come across someone asking for their breasts to be removed but have heard\nseveral stories in the media where this has been performed in similar circumstances. You\nare uncertain about some of the ethical issues regarding her case and tell the patient that\nyou will consider her request but that you are unable to give her a definite answer yet. You\narrange to see her again in 2 weeks after you have had a chance to discuss her request with\nyour colleagues and the hospital’s clinical ethics committee.\nQuestion\n• Is removal of healthy tissue ever appropriate to prevent disease?",

She has no breast symptoms and her exam and recent imaging are unremarkable. She requests bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction and asks to be placed on the surgical schedule. She says she understands the loss of sensation, possible complications, and that surgery cannot eliminate risk. She also says she feels unable to live with repeated screening and the possibility of being diagnosed “too late.” You worry about performing an irreversible operation on healthy tissue and the physical and psychological harms if she later regrets it. Surveillance and risk‑reducing medication are available but would require years of follow-up and ongoing uncertainty. Hospital policy allows either pathway when informed consent is documented.
