      "source_text": "CASE 18:\nPARENTAL REFUSAL OF TREATMENT\nA 7-year-old boy is being treated for medulloblastoma, a type of brain tumour. He has had\nsurgery and is due to start a treatment protocol that involves radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nHis parents (who were married at the time of his birth) are now separated, and although his\nfather agrees to the treatment protocol, his mother is strongly opposed to radiotherapy. She is\nvery worried about the impact it may have on surrounding brain tissue, citing evidence that\nit may reduce his IQ and make him infertile. The treating team is worried that his chances of\nsurvival will be much decreased if he does not have radiotherapy, which has been shown to\nincrease the chance of disease-free survival from 35% to 80%.\nHis mother wants to explore other treatment options, including an alternative form of\nradiotherapy called proton beam irradiation (which is not recommended for this type of\ntumour in this country) or using hyperbaric oxygen rather than any form of radiother-\napy. The clinicians are very worried that any delay in treatment will reduce the chances\nof the radiotherapy being successful. They have sought a second opinion from a paedi-\natric oncology team in a separate hospital, who are wholly in agreement with their treat-\nment plan.\nQuestions\n• If parents refuse treatment for their child against doctors’ advice, how should\nwe decide whether or not to proceed with treatment?\n• Does it matter whether it is one parent or both who are opposed to treatment?\n• Does it make any difference if they are divorced or separated?",

The oncology team believes this protocol offers his best chance of long-term control, but it can cause lasting neurocognitive and fertility-related harm. His parents are separated and share legal decision-making. His father agrees to the plan. His mother refuses radiotherapy and wants time to pursue proton therapy abroad or non-radiation alternatives. A second pediatric oncology service reviewed the case and supports starting standard radiotherapy now. The team worries that delaying beyond the planned start date may meaningfully reduce the benefit of radiotherapy and risks tumor regrowth. Hospital counsel advises that either seeking authorization to proceed or honoring the refusal while treatment is revisited is legally permissible in this situation.

        "vignette": "A 7-year-old boy underwent gross total resection of a medulloblastoma four weeks ago. Staging shows no metastatic disease and tumor biology is considered favorable-risk. He is clinically stable and scheduled to start craniospinal radiotherapy with protocol-based chemotherapy next week at your center. This approach is widely used but can cause lasting neurocognitive, endocrine, and fertility-related harm. His parents are separated and share legal decision-making. There is no single surrogate. Moving forward today would proceed over the objection of the other legally authorized parent. His father consents to starting photon radiotherapy on schedule. His mother refuses any radiation planning steps and requests transfer for proton therapy. Proton therapy may reduce late toxicity, but transfer could delay radiotherapy by weeks. Your team worries that starting beyond about six weeks after surgery can worsen tumor control. Radiotherapy start slots and proton capacity are limited shared resources. Proton therapy is also substantially more costly. You must decide today to keep or release the radiotherapy start slot.",
