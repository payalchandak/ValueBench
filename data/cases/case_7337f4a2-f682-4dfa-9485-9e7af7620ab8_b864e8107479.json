        "vignette": "A 34-year-old man comes to the emergency department with fever, severe headache, repeated vomiting, and new confusion. He is disoriented and cannot explain his symptoms or repeat back information. He swats staff away and tries to leave despite redirection and a brief trial of anxiolysis. Security can prevent elopement, but he will not hold still for positioning. Head CT shows no mass effect. Platelets are adequate and he is not on anticoagulants. You start empiric IV antibiotics now, and the team continues acyclovir and adjunctive steroids while meningitis or encephalitis remains possible. Without cerebrospinal fluid results, the team would likely continue broad, potentially nephrotoxic therapy with ICU-level monitoring, maintain strict isolation, and initiate provisional public health notifications that could affect his employment and privacy. Infectious disease notes that delaying lumbar puncture is likely to delay pathogen-directed therapy and can worsen neurologic outcomes. The ICU and negative-pressure rooms are near capacity and other patients are waiting. After antibiotics, CSF yield may fall and prolong this uncertainty. Procedural sedation and restraint could worsen delirium and carry aspiration and airway risks. The on-call sedation team is available only for the next hour, and family is unlikely to be reached until later. Hospital policy and state law allow either proceeding over objection in this time-sensitive emergency or deferring an invasive test to seek a surrogate.",
