      "source_text": "CASE 98:\nPROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES\nJohn is admitted to hospital following a car accident. He has multiple injuries and requires\nfull nursing care. During his stay in hospital he becomes very attached to one of the junior\ndoctors. He sees her every day on the ward round and she often stays to talk to him after tak-\ning his blood or changing his dressings. As John recovers he starts flirting with the doctor.\nShe is flattered and is finding more and more reason to stay and talk to him. While she is\nremoving the sutures from a scar on his face, he tells her that she is beautiful and tries to kiss\nher. Uncertain about what to do and her own feelings, the doctor leaves and avoids seeing\nJohn for a few days. However, when he is discharged a week later she gives him her number\nand says they should go out for a drink now that he is no longer an inpatient.\nQuestions\n• Is it appropriate for a doctor to have a relationship with a patient?\n• What should a doctor do if she is serious about having a relationship with a patient?\n• Are their situations where relationships would be inappropriate even if the thera-\npeutic relationship had ended?",
