      "source_text": "Case 2-3\nInfertility Treatment: God's Will?\nBette Gabriele had struggled with obesity most of her adult life. She lost\nand gained 100 pounds at least twice. When she finally found a healthy\ncombination of diet and exercise, she was almost 30. A year later she met\nGino, the man she would marry. For the past six years the Garbrieles have\ntried to conceive. Both were fully evaluated at an infertility center. Test re-\nsults indicated that the Gabrieles have unexplained infertility, although\nBette’s age and weight gain since her marriage were risk factors in the de-\nvelopment of infertility.\nAs a practicing Catholic, Ms. Gabriele spoke to her priest, who said\nthere were no church objections to drugs to induce ovarian hyperstimulation\n(OH) or timed intercourse. In vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemi-\nnation (IUI) were not permitted. If any treatment resulted in multiple preg-\nnancies, reduction of the number of embryos, a common recommendation,\nwould be forbidden as it would be seen as abortion according to Church\nteaching.\nMs. Gabriele began OH treatment but did not become pregnant during\nher first cycle. She was discouraged because of her efforts and of the signifi-\ncant expense. A friend who was going through the same treatment decided\nto terminate further treatment after IVF failure. She told Ms. Gabriele, “You\njust have to accept the reality that technology doesn’t work all the time.”\nWith her husband's encouragement, Ms. Gabriele decided to continue\ntreatment. The next month, hope loomed on the horizon. Studies showed\nthere were multiple mature follicles indicating a good chance of a multife-\ntal pregnancy, thus increasing the risks to the fetuses and herself if she\ncarried all of the babies to delivery.\nShe felt like time was running out, so she opted to proceed, saying to\nherself that whatever happened was God's will.",
