He is hemodynamically stable but has worsening anemia and intermittent fevers. The oncology team recommends starting induction chemotherapy during this admission. His mother is the sole legal guardian. She refuses chemotherapy after reading about long-term toxicities and says their longtime naturopath will treat him instead. She asks to take him home today and declines further hospital interventions beyond comfort measures and supplements. The team worries that delaying treatment could allow rapid clinical decline and foreclose a chance at cure. Forcing treatment could require restraining a frightened child and may permanently fracture the family’s relationship with the medical system.

        "vignette": "A 2-year-old boy is admitted after weeks of bruising and fatigue. Testing confirms acute lymphoblastic leukemia with profound cytopenias and intermittent fevers. Cultures are sent and broad-spectrum antibiotics are started. Echocardiography for a new murmur shows severe cardiomyopathy. The oncology team expects induction to require central-line placement, frequent transfusions and blood draws, and a real chance of ICU-level complications. They also worry that induction drugs and fluid shifts could precipitate decompensated heart failure. The team believes delaying induction increases near-term risk of fatal sepsis or bleeding, but some feel a closely monitored 48–72-hour pause for stabilization and risk stratification is acceptable. His mother is the sole legal guardian. After informed-refusal counseling on risks, benefits, and alternatives, she still refuses chemotherapy today and asks to switch to naturopathic care, though she would consider treatment after an urgent second opinion. She will only allow 72 hours of inpatient supportive care; otherwise she plans to leave. Hospital policy does not allow holding a medically stable child without a court order. Counsel and child protection confirm that either an emergency court petition now or a time-limited inpatient deferral with notification is legally permissible, and the team must consider the child’s right to standard, evidence-based cancer care.",
