She has been referred to your surgical clinic by her GP as\nrecent genetic tests have revealed that Diane carries the BRCA 1 gene. These were performed\nby the local genetics department as her mum and older sister had both developed breast\ncancer in their 40s. Diane has come to request that you list her for surgery to remove both\nbreasts in an attempt to prevent her from developing breast cancer.\nYou have never come across someone asking for their breasts to be removed but have heard\nseveral stories in the media where this has been performed in similar circumstances. You\nare uncertain about some of the ethical issues regarding her case and tell the patient that\nyou will consider her request but that you are unable to give her a definite answer yet. You\narrange to see her again in 2 weeks after you have had a chance to discuss her request with\nyour colleagues and the hospital’s clinical ethics committee.\nQuestion\n• Is removal of healthy tissue ever appropriate to prevent disease?",

She is currently healthy, has no suspicious findings on exam or recent imaging, and says she has thought about this for years; she requests a bilateral prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction because she does not want to live with ongoing fear or repeated surveillance. She understands that surgery would permanently change her body and sensation and carries real risks (including complications, chronic pain, and the possibility of needing multiple operations), and she says she would still want surgery even if future screening remained available. You believe enhanced surveillance and preventive medication are medically reasonable alternatives and worry that operating now could expose her to avoidable harm and regret, but refusing the request may prolong distress and undermine her sense of control over her health. As the treating surgeon, you must decide what to recommend at today’s visit.",
