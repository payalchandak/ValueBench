The ambulance record indicates\nthat his initial blood pressure was 120/70 mm Hg, pulse was 95/min,\nand respirations were 16/min. The patient's current blood pressure\nis 70/40 mm Hg, pulse is 130/min, and respirations are 28/min. He\nhas an open gunshot wound in the chest and an exit wound in the\nback. Intravenous fluids and vasopressors are started, and a blood\ntransfusion is ordered. The patient's fiance arrives and states that he\nshould not receive a blood transfusion because he is a devout\nJehovah's Witness. No evidence is found in the medical chart of\nadvance directives or a living will documenting the patient's wishes\nand examination of his belongings show no blood refusal card.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate next step in management of\nthis patient?\na.
