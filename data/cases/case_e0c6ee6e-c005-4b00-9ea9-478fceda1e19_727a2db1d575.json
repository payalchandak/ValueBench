      "source_text": "Case 4-7\nA Physician Choosing between His Patient and His Own Family\nWilliam Peters, a general surgeon in a small practice that included three\ngeneral surgeons, two obstetricians, and two general practitioners, was on\ncall on a weekend. His daughter, Suzy, was a high school senior who was\nscheduled to sing a solo in a major musical production that Saturday after-\nnoon. Dr. Peters, perhaps unduly optimistic that he would not be called,\nfailed to change the schedule with one of the other surgeons. Unfortunately,\nhe got a call from the emergency room just before Suzy was to make her\ndebut. The patient was a 7-year-old boy whom Dr. Peters saw a year earlier\nfor appendicitis. The boy had sustained a full thickness laceration of the\nface, obviously requiring repair.\nDr. Peters immediately realized his dilemma: if he went to the hospital,\nhe would miss being present for his daughter's long-practiced performance.\nHe considered one of the other general surgeons in the practice but that\nseemed unfair to the colleague and would mean the boy would see a stranger\nrather than someone he would remember from their previous contact.\nHe guiltily stayed for her introduction and heard a few notes, then left\nthe auditorium. As he drove to the hospital, his frustration grew. On arrival,\nthe nursing staff had done the basic preparation; he briefly re-introduced\nhimself and gave minimal information to the parents and to the child. As\nhe repaired the injury, he couldn't help but share his disappointment of\nmissing his daughter's performance. Instructions were given for care of the\nwound and follow-up for office removal of the sutures. The father of the\nchild later called Dr. Peters’s office to notify the doctor that the child would\nnot be brought back to him for further care.",

You are the on-call general surgeon and are credentialed and experienced in layered lip repairs. Either you or a plastic surgeon can achieve an acceptable functional repair. Plastics may offer a modest cosmetic advantage and a lower risk of vermilion misalignment or noticeable scarring. A plastic surgeon is available from home and can arrive in about an hour. Waiting means prolonged fasting and distress. It also increases swelling and may require deeper sedation. The on-call plastic surgeon is also covering multiple facilities and other emergencies, and activating after-hours call-in uses limited specialist resources and overtime costs that can delay other patients’ care. Hospital policy and state law permit either plan with parental consent. The parents want the best appearance but also want the repair done soon.",
