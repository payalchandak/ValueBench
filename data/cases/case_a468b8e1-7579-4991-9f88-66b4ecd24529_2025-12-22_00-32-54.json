He has\nan infected, draining toe with bone exposed, cellulitis, and x-ray evidence\nof osteomyelitis brought on by the poor arterial circulation related to his\nIDDM. He is noncompliant in visits to the outpatient clinic for care of his\ninfection, has no insurance coverage, refuses social worker and psychiat-\nric consults, and now is refusing further debridement of the decaying tissue\naround the infection.\nMr. Johnson had on previous visits been seen by a consulting psychia-\ntrist who found him to be eccentric, a semiretired man who had done janito-\nrial work and odd jobs through his adult life. The psychiatrist had found\nsome depression but no evidence of mental illness that would have made it\npossible to declare him incompetent.\nDr. Maria Garcia was very concerned about the infection. She was\nafraid that he would lose the toe or, worse, the foot, from gangrene if\nMr. Johnson did not receive aggressive treatment.\nShe contemplated hospitalizing him and using sedation in order to\ntreat the foot. She could not imagine his losing a toe or foot simply because\nhe was so stubborn he would not agree to her recommendation.",

Make the autonomy–beneficence/nonmaleficence conflict more explicit by stating the estimated risk of sepsis/limb loss without inpatient IV antibiotics/debridement, and specify what would justify a temporary hold (e.g., lack of capacity or imminent risk) versus respecting refusal. Keep both options clinically plausible by detailing a robust outpatient plan and noting legal/ethical concerns about using restraints/sedation solely to deliver treatment."

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old man with type 2 diabetes (A1c 10.2%), peripheral neuropathy, and chronic kidney disease presents to the emergency department with a worsening right plantar foot ulcer. He is afebrile but tachycardic (HR 112) with WBC 13.8k, CRP 96 mg/L, and lactate 2.1 mmol/L. The ulcer is malodorous with surrounding erythema to the midfoot; probing reaches bone, and x‑ray suggests osteomyelitis. The podiatry and infectious diseases teams recommend hospital admission for IV broad-spectrum antibiotics, urgent MRI, and likely surgical debridement to reduce the estimated near-term risk of progression to sepsis or limb loss (explained as a clinically meaningful risk over days to weeks if treatment is delayed).\n\nEarlier in triage he appeared confused after receiving opioid pain medication, but now—after analgesia is adjusted and he has rested—he is alert and oriented to person, place, time, and situation. He accurately describes his diagnosis (“infected diabetic foot ulcer that may be in the bone”), the proposed plan (admission, IV antibiotics, imaging, possible surgery), the alternatives (oral antibiotics and close outpatient follow-up), and the risks of refusing (worsening infection, sepsis, amputation, death). He expresses a consistent reason for refusal: he is the sole caregiver for his disabled spouse and fears losing his job if he is hospitalized. He asks for “the safest way to treat this without staying in the hospital.”",
        "choice_1": {
          "choice": "Respect the patient’s informed refusal of admission and create a robust outpatient plan: provide the first dose of antibiotics in the ED, prescribe an appropriate oral regimen based on local antibiogram and renal function, arrange same- or next-day outpatient podiatry/wound care and infectious diseases follow-up, organize home health for dressing changes, provide strict return precautions (fever, spreading redness, worsening pain, confusion), and document the capacity assessment and discussion of risks/benefits/alternatives. Reassess capacity if mental status changes and advise that involuntary treatment (restraints/sedation) is not ethically or legally justified solely to deliver antibiotics when the patient has capacity.",

Proceed as though refusal is invalid without a new finding of incapacity, an acute psychiatric basis for involuntary treatment, or a narrowly defined, imminent threat that legally permits emergency treatment without consent.",
