The surgical team estimates his near-term risk of deterioration is low but not zero (e.g., bleeding, arrhythmia, respiratory failure), and they would prefer ICU monitoring overnight.\n\nIn the emergency department, Ms. L, a 54-year-old with presumed urosepsis, is intubated in septic shock. She is on escalating norepinephrine (0.25 µg/kg/min) with vasopressin just started, has a rising lactate (5.8), and needs ICU-only care: continuous vasopressor titration via central line, ventilator management with frequent blood gases, and 1:1 nursing. There are no other ICU beds available hospital-wide, and regional transfer is delayed by weather for at least 6–8 hours. Boarding her in the ED increases the risk of delayed titration, line complications, and cardiopulmonary arrest.\n\nThe charge nurse notes that the step-down unit can provide telemetry and q2–4 hour vitals with a 1:4 nurse ratio but cannot manage continuous vasopressors, rapid ventilator support, or immediate bedside procedures. The intensivist must decide whether to keep Mr. J in the ICU or move him to step-down to free the only ICU bed for Ms. L.
