He was being kept alive by dialysis, which could not\nbe continued much longer. He was considered for a deceased donor trans-\nplant, but the waiting times were typically too long. His entire family was\ntested to see if they could become living donors, including his parents and\na number of relatives.\nAs a last resort, his 27-year-old brother Jerry was tested and was found\ncompatible. He, however, had Down syndrome and was a resident of the\nFrankfort State Hospital and school, described as being a state institution for\nthe “feebleminded.” He had an intelligence quotient (IQ) of approximately 35,\na mental age of approximately six years. He also had a speech defect,\nmaking it difficult to communicate with those not well acquainted with him.\nAva Strunk, the mother of Tommy and Jerry, petitioned the court to ap-\nprove procurement from Tommy. Normally, parents are obligated to serve\nthe best interests of their children. While the procurement would surely be\nin Tommy’s interest, it seemed contrary to Jerry’s. The argument was made\nthat the kidney transplant would be beneficial not only to Tommy but also\nto Jerry, “because Jerry was greatly dependent upon Tommy, emotionally\nand psychologically, and that his well-being would be jeopardized more\nseverely by the loss of his brother than by the removal of a kidney.” The\nissue is whether the court should approve.®",

He has been on dialysis for years and is now developing complications that make long-term dialysis increasingly difficult. A deceased-donor transplant is unlikely in time. His only compatible living donor is his 27-year-old brother, who has Down syndrome, lives in a state residential program, and communicates in short phrases. He enjoys visits with the patient and becomes distressed when separated from family routines. Their mother is his legal guardian and requests donation, saying the brothers are closely bonded. The brother can assent in a limited way but does not grasp long-term surgical risks or what losing a kidney means. A donor advocate notes that donation surgery is usually safe but not risk-free and will permanently change his medical future.

        "vignette": "A 28-year-old man has end-stage kidney disease from chronic glomerulonephritis. He has been on dialysis for years. Dialysis is still an option, but it is increasingly burdensome. His vascular access has required repeated procedures, and he has had intermittent infections and hospitalizations. The wait for a deceased-donor kidney is long and uncertain. No other family or friends are medically eligible to donate, and his center cannot offer paired exchange for this blood type. His only compatible living donor is his 27-year-old brother with Down syndrome who lives in a state residential program. A capacity evaluation finds he can describe the surgery and short-term pain. Today he again affirms he wants to donate. He cannot reliably explain long-term risks or future health implications. Disruption of routine may require sedation or temporary restraints after surgery, and the residence must commit to lifelong follow-up. The team must weigh the recipient’s substantial expected benefit against the donor’s nontrivial perioperative and lifetime risks. They also worry about protecting a vulnerable donor and setting a precedent that could be exploitative. Hospital policy and state law permit either proceeding with guardian consent or declining donation. The transplant team must decide this week to keep the surgical slot and donor clearance valid.",
