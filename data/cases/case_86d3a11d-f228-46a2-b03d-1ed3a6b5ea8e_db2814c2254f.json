      "source_text": "CASE 14:\nCONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION\nAdele is a 39-year-old solicitor. She is 16 weeks pregnant with her first child. Following her\nfirst trimester scan at 13 weeks she was informed that she was high risk for having a child with\nDown’s syndrome. She underwent further diagnostic testing in the form of amniocenteses\nwhich confirmed the diagnosis. The couple is distraught as they had tried for a long time to conceive, but Adele does not think she can cope with a baby with Down’s syndrome. Despite\ncounselling, Adele is now sure that she wants to terminate the pregnancy. She visits her GP\nto request a termination. However, the GP is a practising Roman Catholic with a strong faith,\nand he does not wish to participate in abortion services.",

She requests a referral from her general practitioner. The GP holds a sincere religious objection to participating in abortion care.
