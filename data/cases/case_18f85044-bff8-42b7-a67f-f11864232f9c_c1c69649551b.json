      "source_text": "Case 17-6\nAn Adolescent Refusing a Blood Transfusion\nBrian and Melissa Tracy were the parents of 17-year-old, Tammy. The par-\nents were Jehovah's Witnesses who had had raised their daughter in the reli-\ngion, which has as one of its tenets an opposition to transfusion of blood.\nOn the basis of their interpretation of the Bible, any consumption of blood\nis forbidden and most Jehovah's Witnesses believe that this prohibits\ntransfusion.\"! The result would be eternal damnation and, in some cases,\nan end to the acceptance of the person in the religious community.\nWhen Tammy was diagnosed with leukemia at age 16 their family phy-\nsician, Dr. Stephen Erwin, anticipated that the family’s opposition to trans-\nfusion could be a problem. Soon after her seventeenth birthday, Tammy\nhad to be hospitalized for septicemia, anemia, and fatigue. Dr. Erwin knew\nthat for a patient without religious objections, a blood transfusion would be\nstandard treatment for the anemia. He discussed the issue with Mr. and\nMrs. Tracy, who steadfastly insisted that their daughter be treated without\nblood. He also discussed the problem with Tammy, who, at first, appeared\nconfused about what was at stake, but eventually seemed to have a very\nclear understanding of the situation. She hesitatingly expressed her agree-\nment with her parents’ position.\nDr. Erwin explored the possibility of using blood substitutes that\nprovide blood volume without raising issues of using actual blood prod-\nucts. These are acceptable to Jehovah's Witnesses but would not help in\nTammy's case since she needed red blood cells. After a delay of several\ndays, Dr. Erwin was becoming worried. He was aware that hospital at-\ntorneys could get a court order for blood for minors against the wishes\nof parents when a transfusion was potentially a life-and-death matter.\nHe also knew that some minors are considered “mature” and are given\nauthority to consent on their own behalf even if their parents object to\nmedical treatment.\nDr. Erwin, after consultation with the hospital ethics committee and\nhospital attorneys, determined that he had at least five options:\n1. Seek a court order attempting to override the parents’ refusal.\n2. Claim the patient was a mature minor and attempt to persuade\nTammy to consent to the transfusion.\n3. Give Tammy a transfusion without getting consent after giving her\nmedication so she would sleep through the procedure.\n4. Accept the parents’ refusal of blood (while still providing other sup-\nportive therapies).\n5. Accept Tammy's refusal if she cannot be persuaded to consent as a\nmature minor (while still providing other supportive therapies).",

Your team believes a transfusion is the usual way to stabilize her while treating the infection. Without it, she may deteriorate quickly and could die during this hospitalization. The patient says she is choosing the refusal herself, but she also fears being rejected by her community if she accepts blood.
