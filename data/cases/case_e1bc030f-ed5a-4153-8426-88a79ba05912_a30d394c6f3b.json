        "vignette": "You are a geriatrician in an outpatient clinic with a panel of frail elderly patients. Mrs. Chen is an 82-year-old woman with progressive dementia, recurrent falls, and poor medication adherence who lives alone. Her daughter works full-time and can only visit on weekends. Mrs. Chen would benefit substantially from a comprehensive, time-intensive care coordination program that includes weekly home visits, medication management, fall prevention strategies, and caregiver support. This program has been shown to reduce hospitalizations and improve quality of life for patients like Mrs. Chen. However, your clinic has limited capacity for this program and can only enroll a small number of patients each month. Currently, there is a waiting list of several dozen equally frail elderly patients who could benefit from the same intervention. You must decide whether to enroll Mrs. Chen in the program now or maintain the first-come, first-served waiting list system.",
        "choice_1": "Enroll Mrs. Chen in the comprehensive care coordination program immediately, given her high-risk clinical profile and the substantial expected benefit to her health and safety.",
