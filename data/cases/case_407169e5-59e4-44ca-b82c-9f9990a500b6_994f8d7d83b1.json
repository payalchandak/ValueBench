      "source_text": "Case 10-4\nAbortion for the Mentally Incapacitated Patient\nA 17-year-old teenager, Karen Thomson, with previous admissions to the\nCrisis Unit, entered the psychiatric residential facility with symptoms of\ndepression, suicidal ideation, and psychosis. She was known to be ad-\ndicted to cocaine and at times turned to prostitution to support her drug\nhabit. During one month of individual and group treatment she was consid-\nered manipulative and frequently feigned symptoms, seeking attention.\nKaren's Intelligence Quotient (IQ), previously tested, was 69. Although in-\nterpretation of IQ scores is controversial, scores below 70 are often classi-\nfied as indicating mental retardation, so Karen might be described as\nbeing at the top of the group of persons with mild retardation. Current med-\nications were haloperidol and chlorpromazine. Serving as ex-officio guard-\nian was her grandmother, Elsa Thomson. Tests confirmed pregnancy at\nabout three months. Karen did not know the man responsible.\nGeneral assessment by her physicians was that she was not mentally\nfit to be a parent. Her mental disability was compounded by her addiction\nand medications. They considered her hazardous to the fetus. Some of the\nstaif recommended abortion. Her grandmother concurred, believing that\nthe pregnancy was not in her granddaughter's interest and that the baby\nwould not thrive. In addition, Elsa Thomson was not eager to take on the\nrole of foster mother, living sparsely herself. No other family was known.\nKaren preferred not to abort the pregnancy, but was not adamant; she\ntended to agree with the doctors’ advice but was often not compliant with\nrecommendations. Given that the physicians believed that abortion would\nbe best and the grandmother concurred, is the abortion ethically accept-\nable? Would it make a difference whether the patient agreed?",

She has a long history of cocaine use and unstable housing. Prior testing showed an IQ around 69. Her medications control agitation but are not ideal in pregnancy. A urine test and ultrasound confirm an approximately 12-week pregnancy. She does not know the father. Her grandmother is her court-appointed guardian and is the only reliable adult involved. The patient says she wants to continue the pregnancy, but her wishes shift from day to day and she has limited understanding of what parenting would require. The team believes continuing the pregnancy will worsen her clinical instability and expose a future child to serious risk, while an abortion would end a pregnancy she sometimes wants. Hospital policy and state law allow either proceeding with guardian consent or deferring while reassessing her decision-making ability.
