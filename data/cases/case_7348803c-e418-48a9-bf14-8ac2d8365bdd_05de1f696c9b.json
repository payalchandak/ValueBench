      "source_text": "CASE 71:\nBASIC CARE AND MEDICAL TREATMENT AT THE\nEND OF LIFE\nBertie is an elderly man receiving inpatient care following deterioration at home. He has\nadvanced dementia and prostate cancer that has spread to his bones. He has been lovingly\ncared for by his wife and children throughout his illness, but they are all aware that he is now\ndying. It has been many months since Bertie has been able to speak or leave his bed, and he\nno longer appears to recognise his family. While Bertie would previously chew and swallow\nfood placed in his mouth, over the last few days he no longer does this and has coughed and\nchoked on several occasions when given water to drink. The clinical team has explained that\nBertie is dying and that he is likely to die within days. His family has understood the explana-\ntion from the speech and language therapist that Bertie is unable to swallow safely, and even\nthough the clinical team would support the family with risk feeding, the family does not wish\nto cause any coughing or choking. Risk feeding acknowledges that there is a risk of choking\nand food or drink going into the lungs of a patient unable to swallow safely. This risk may be\nseen as acceptable if withholding food or drink is felt to be inappropriate, for instance if the\npatient is in the last days of life. Instead, Bertie’s family has asked the clinical team to place a\nfeeding tube, so that their father ‘doesn’t starve to death’. They accept that he is likely to die\nin the next few days from his underlying medical issues.\nQuestions\n• What is the difference between medical treatment and basic medical care?\n• Can clinically assisted nutrition and hydration legally be withdrawn?",

His wife and adult children accept that he is dying but ask for a feeding tube so he “doesn’t starve,” and they want to avoid further choking episodes. You worry that tube placement may cause distress, require restraints, and still lead to regurgitation or aspiration, but withholding assisted hydration may leave the family feeling you are abandoning basic care.

        "vignette": "An 84-year-old man with advanced dementia and metastatic prostate cancer is hospitalized for worsening weakness and poor intake. He is bedbound, nonverbal, and lacks decision-making capacity. An advance directive completed before his dementia states he would want tube feeding if he could not eat. Over 48 hours he coughs and gags with sips and pureed food. He turns his head away and pushes caregivers\u0019 hands away during feeding attempts, suggesting possible nonverbal dissent. His wife is his legal surrogate and requests a short trial of artificial nutrition and hydration. You think his decline may be partly reversible, but his overall trajectory is poor. A nasogastric tube could provide fluids, calories, and reliable analgesics. It may require mittens, sedation, or close observation, and aspiration pneumonia or nasal injury can occur. Without a tube, dehydration and unreliable analgesia may worsen delirium or discomfort. Repeated IV and subcutaneous access attempts have failed. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach. The team must decide today before radiology-guided placement with sedation becomes the only option.",
