      "source_text": "CASE 70:\nQUALITY OF LIFE AND SANCTITY OF LIFE JUDGEMENTS\nNora is 62 years old and has had multiple sclerosis for 25 years. Initially the disease fol-\nlowed a relapsing and remitting course, and Nora would have long periods of good health\nin between months of various disabling side effects, such as temporary paralysis and visual\nproblems. For the past 10 years, however, her condition has become more disabling and Nora\nhas had to move into a nursing home. The staff are friendly and she is well cared for. As a\nresult of the insidious effect of her illness, most of her bodily functions have ceased to work\nand she is doubly incontinent. On the days when she is well enough to be aware of her sur-\nroundings she finds her condition extremely distressing. She is embarrassed by her lack of\nbodily control and the fact that she has to have 24-hour nursing care. Her swallowing is\nunsafe and, following an admission with aspiration pneumonia a year ago, the decision was\nmade to insert a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) to provide all the nutrition\nshe requires. She now does not even get pleasure from eating or drinking. Some days she is\ndescribed by staff as being barely conscious, but when she is, they are concerned that she is\nlonely as she rarely gets visitors.\nQuestions\n• Does respect for the principle of sanctity of life require that life-prolonging treat-\nment should always be provided, irrespective of the quality of that life?\n• From whose perspective is quality of life to be judged?",

A PEG tube was placed after aspiration pneumonia, and she no longer eats or drinks. Staff report long periods of minimal responsiveness. When she is awake, she appears frightened and distressed during suctioning and tube-feed related retching. She rarely has visitors. She is now hospitalized again with aspiration pneumonia and increasing oxygen needs. She has no written directive, and her ability to communicate is inconsistent. Her daughter asks for “everything” to be done and wants her returned to the nursing home on tube feeds. The bedside team worries that ongoing interventions are prolonging suffering without meaningful recovery. Hospital policy and state law allow either continuing or withdrawing life-prolonging treatment in this situation. A decision is needed today before escalation to ICU-level care.",
