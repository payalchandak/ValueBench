      "source_text": "He ™ Case 13-1\nWarning: Premarital Sex May Be Dangerous to Your Health\nThe British General Medical Council's Disciplinary Committee was\ncharged in 1971 with the task of deciding whether or not a physician was\nguilty of “serious professional misconduct,” whereupon it made the following\nreport: ‘\nThe Committee next inquired into the charge against Dr. Robert John Denis\nBrowne of Birmingham, that he had disclosed to the father of a Miss X that an\noral contraceptive had been prescribed for her by the Birmingham Brook Ad-\nvisory Centre, notwithstanding that he had been given the information in\nconfidence by the Centre and that he had neither sought nor received her per-\nmission to make the disclosure.\nThe complainant was the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre, which was\nrepresented by Mr. G. 8. Jonas, Solicitor. ...\nMr. Jonas said that it was only after the most anxious thought and de-\nliberation, including meetings with Dr. Browne, that the matter had been\nbrought before the Disciplinary Committee. Dr. Browne had practiced in\nBirmingham since 1941 and was highly regarded by his patients. Mr. Jonas\nalleged that, in his capacity as a doctor, he had received confidential infor-\nmation about one of his patients and quite deliberately and, for no valid\nmedical reason, had betrayed that confidence by telling the patient's father\nwhat he had been told.\nAt the time Miss X called at the center she was just over 16, a highly\nintelligent, attractive, and mature young woman. Mr. Jonas told the Com-\nmittee that when an oral contraceptive was prescribed, it was the practice\nof the clinic to inform the family doctor unless the patient specifically for-\nbade it. In this instance, Miss X agreed to her doctor being informed.\nDr. Browne had informed the girl's father that she was “on the pill.” No\neffort had been made by Dr. Browne to discuss the matter with his patient,\nand the patient's consent to this disclosure was neither sought nor ob-\ntained. Dr. Browne had said he would have to do the same again in every\ncase that came to his notice, and the only situation he could see was that\nthe center should never again inform him if one of his patients came to see\nthem. He had said it was all very well for the clinic prescribing the pill but,\nif anything went wrong, he would have to deal with the problem.\nThe burden of the complaint was that the doctor let his views interfere with the\nobjectivity demanded of a professional man.\nThe press had said the issue was important for doctors, and also to\npatients, but in Mr. Jonas’s submission it was primarily important to pa-\ntients, whose confidence must be kept. The confidence was always with the\npatient, it was never that of the doctor.\n[A clinic physician testified that he] felt it important that the general\npractitioner should be informed so that if there were any side effect the\ndoctor would have knowledge that the girl was taking oral contraceptives.\nMr. R. Alexander, Counsel for Dr. Browne submitted that this was not, in\nany sense, a test case. The sole issue was whether this respected doctor\nhad been guilty of the offense of serious professional misconduct. There\nwere three issues: first, could one doctor unilaterally impose a confidence\non another, and by unilaterally he meant could he do so without seeking the\nconsent of the other doctor; second, what was the position with regard to the\nduty or right of a doctor to tell the parents of a child who had not reached\nthe age of majority of the medical treatment that child was receiving; and\nthe third issue was that medical confidence existed for the benefit of the\npatient. If the doctor believed it to be in the interests of the patient to reveal\nthe confidence to a third party, then he was entitled to do so.\nDr. Browne, in evidence, said that he was 63 years of age and was mar-\nried with three children, including a girl of 18. He had qualified in 1941 and\nhad been in practice in Birmingham for about thirty years. The parents of\nthe girl had been his patients for many years, and he had been their doctor\nat the time of her birth. She had been his patient all her life. She still was\nhis patient, and he had seen her professionally quite recently.\nWhen he had received the letter from the Brook Centre, it sounded an\nalarm bell in his mind. He was concerned that a girl only just 16 had been\nplaced on a contraceptive pill without prior knowledge or consultation with\nthe family doctor. It was a stable family, with the daughter living at home.\nHe had discussed the matter, which gave him great anxiety, with profes-\nsional colleagues. He tried to get an estimate of the situation without men-\ntioning anyone’s name and considered the problem carefully.\nThe girl's father happened to come to the surgery shortly after this, and\nhe asked him if his daughter was getting married. The father said that she\nwas not, but that she had a steady boyfriend and was still at school.\nDr. Browne said he thought hard and then made up his mind—bearing in\nmind the girl's best interests, and for that reason solely—and handed the\nfather a copy of the letter from the Centre and explained what it meant.\nDr. Browne said that he had had two motives in informing the parents.\nOne was the physical hazards of the pill, and second were the moral and\npsychological hazards. He was not standing in judgment, but with his\nknowledge of the home background, and knowing the parents were sym-\npathetic and kindly and could handle the situation with care and tact, he\nconsidered that parents were the best people to counsel her in their own\nway. He also saw psychological hazards, for if she were keeping a secret\nshe might have a sense of guilt, which could have a harmful effect on her\nemotionally. He pointed out that it would have been difficult for him to con-\ntact the girl without arousing parental suspicion. The episode did not\nappear to have impaired his relationship with Miss X.\nIn reply to cross-examination by Mr. Jonas, Dr. Browne said that his in-\nterests were primarily for the patient and for her alone. He had no other inter-\nest except what was best for her. His patient was being placed on a dangerous\ndrug, without his prior knowledge or consent, with all the hazards that might\ninvolve—and steroid drugs were a particular hazard.\nDr. Walter Woolley, ex-Chairman of the Central Ethical Committee of\nthe British Medical Association, told the Committee he had been a family\ndoctor since 1933. In his view, a third party could not fetter the right of the\ndoctor—for instance, by a letter such as the one from the Brook Centre—to\nexercise his own judgment.\nDame Amis Gillie said that she had had thirty-eight years’ experi-\nence in general practice, and, in her view, professional secrecy existed in\nthe interest of the patient. She considered that there could be situations in\nwhich the benefit of the patient meant that a confidence must be dis-\nclosed. Every case should be judged on its own merits by the practitioner\ninvolved.\nThe final witness was Dr. J. C. Cameron, Chairman of the General\nMedical Services Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA). He\nhad been in general practice for many years and believed that a long-\nstanding knowledge of a patient was of great advantage in forming an as-\nsessment of a situation. He would have preferred that, if possible, the girl's\nconsent should have been sought prior to the disclosure to her parents, but\nthere might be circumstances in which this was impracticable.\nAfter consideration in camera the President said:\nThe Committee has found [that it has been] proved that the information you\nreceived from the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre was in confidence, and\nthat you had neither sought nor received the patient's permission to make the\ndisclosure; but in the particular circumstances of this case... the Committee\ndo not regard your action in disclosing the information referred to in the\ncharge as improper. The Committee therefore has not found that the whole of\nthe facts alleged in the charge, including the word ‘improperly,’ have been\nproved. It has accordingly recorded a finding that you are not guilty of serious\nprofessional misconduct.",
