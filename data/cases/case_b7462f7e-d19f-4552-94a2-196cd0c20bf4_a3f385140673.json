      "source_text": "» Case 18-4\nWithholding Chemotherapy for an Impaired Patient\nJoseph Saikewicz, a 67-year-old white male, was reported to have an Intel-\nligence Quotient (IQ) of 10 and mental age of approximately 2 years,\n8 months, but was otherwise in good health, strong, and well built. He was\nnot able to communicate verbally, using grunts and gestures instead. He\nhad been institutionalized in a state school since 1923 and at the Belchertown\nState School in Massachusetts since 1928. His only known family was two\nsisters who lived in California.\nOn April 19, 1976, Mr. Saikewicz was diagnosed as suffering from acute\nmyeloblastic monocytic leukemia. His physician proposed chemotherapy.\nIt was believed that, with chemotherapy, he had a remission chance of\n30-50 percent. If remission does occur it will typically last for two to thirteen\nmonths, possibly longer. The side effects include nausea, bladder irritation,\nnumbness and tingling of extremities, loss of hair, and bone marrow depres-\nsion. He would die in a matter of weeks or months without the chemotherapy.\nHe was not in pain.\nIt was agreed that most competent patients would elect to undergo\nchemotherapy, but Mr. Saikewicz was unable to understand what would be\ndone with him. The medical personnel envisioned that they would have to\nuse orderlies to hold him down on his bed while the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusions were administered. Thus, even though mentally normal\npeople would choose the therapy because they could understand the ratio-\nnale, for Mr. Saikewicz it would appear that his caregivers had turned on\nhim and were inflicting an unkind and painful assault.\nFor these reasons, his physician recommended that the chemotherapy\nbe omitted. It would offer, for him, more burden than benefit. The adminis-\ntrator of the school was not certain this was ethical or legal. In order to re-\nsolve the conflict, they asked for a judicial opinion on what to do.\nPerhaps because in the early part of the twentieth century families\nwere advised not to visit or bond with those placed in institutional facili-\nties, his sisters chose not to attend the hearing. Mr. Saikewicz was thus\nwithout any family or friends to assist except for the administrative and\nhealth care staff of the school. The issue was whether it was in Mr. Saikewicz’'s\ninterest, given his unique mental capacity, to receive the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusion.\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rendered an opinion that\ncalled into question the role of doctors, family, and hospital committees in\nmaking these decisions, stating: “We take a dim view of any attempt to\nshift the ultimate decision-making responsibility away from the duly es-\ntablished courts of proper jurisdiction to... the attending doctors, family,\nor hospital ethics committees.”\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nGiven these circumstances, what should be done for Mr. Saikewicz and who\nshould make the choice?\nHow does the doctrine of proportionality apply in this case?",
