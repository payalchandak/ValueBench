      "source_text": "Problems of paternalism and autonomy in a high-risk pregnancy\nGillian M. Lockwood\nIntroduction\nRenal transplantation, the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal failure, can correct the infertility due to chronic ill-health, anaemia and tubal damage generally encountered when these patients are managed by renal dialysis. Currently only one in 50 women of child-bearing age becomes pregnant following a renal transplant, and it may be that many more would welcome the chance of biological parenthood if their fertility problems could be overcome. The first successful pregnancy, conceived in 1956 following an identical twin renal transplant, was reported in 1963 (Murray et al., 1963).\nUntil recently pregnancy had been thought to present considerable hazards to the transplant recipient. However, some reviews (Sturgiss and Davison, 1992; Davison, 1994) have suggested that pregnancy in the graft recipient, unlike the rare pregnancy in patients undergoing dialysis, is usually likely to lead to a live birth, and the pregnancy may have little or no adverse effect on either renal function or blood pressure in the transplant recipient. The current medical consensus is that if, prior to conception, renal function is well preserved, and the patient does not develop high blood pressure, then only a minority of transplant recipients will experience a deterioration of their renal function attributable to pregnancy (Lindheimer and Katz, 1992).\nIt is inevitable that the rapid return to good health enjoyed by the majority of women following successful renal transplantation should encourage them to consider conception. Although only a small proportion of women with a functioning graft become spontaneously pregnant, modern Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs), especially in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF – ET), could theoretically increase this proportion to near-normal levels.\nPregnancy, especially if ART is required, clearly entails extra risks for the renal transplant recipient, but these are risks that, with appropriate counselling, the patient may be prepared and even eager to take.\nIn this paper, I shall discuss the ethical dilemmas involved in counselling renal transplant patients seeking pregnancy but requiring ART. This case concerned a couple with long-standing infertility by means of IVF – ET. The wife was a renal transplant recipient whose initial renal failure was due to severe, recurrent pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition of late pregnancy causing raised blood pressure and renal complications, which can progress to cause fits and cerebro-vascular accidents [strokes]. It is associated with severe growth retardation of the fetus, and often, premature delivery.\nA case of high-risk pregnancy\nA 34-year-old woman (Mrs A) was referred to an IVF unit following 8 years of failure to conceive after a reversal-of-sterilization operation had been performed (Lockwood et al., 1995). She had been born with only one poorly developed kidney, but this was not known until, at age 20, she was investigated for very severe pre-eclampsic toxaemia (PET), which she suffered during her first pregnancy. Her baby was born very premature at 26 weeks gestation, and he died shortly after birth from complications of extreme prematurity.\nA second pregnancy in the following year was also complicated by severe PET, renal damage, premature delivery at 26 weeks gestation and neonatal death. Sterilization by tubal ligation was offered and accepted under these circumstances, in view of the anticipated further deterioration of her renal function with any subsequent pregnancy. There was a significant further advance of her renal disease, necessitating the initiation of haemodialysis (a kidney machine) 2 years later, and a living, related donor renal transplant (from her mother) was subsequently performed. After the transplant, Mrs A remained well and maintained good kidney function on a combination of anti-rejection drugs, steroids and blood pressure tablets. At age 26, a reversal-of-sterilization operation was performed because she had become so distressed by her childlessness, but hysterosalpingography (a test to check for fallopian tubal patency) 2 years later, when pregnancy had not occurred, showed that both tubes had once again become blocked.\nAt the time that Mr and Mrs A were referred to the IVF unit, there were no case reports of successful IVF in women with renal transplants, but specialists were becoming increasingly reluctant to advise women with transplants against trying for a baby, as medical care for high-risk pregnancies was improving dramatically. Following discussion with the Transplantation Unit and the high-risk pregnancy specialists, the IVF unit felt that an IVF treatment cycle could be offered to Mr and Mrs A as long as the risks of IVF – ET, over and above those attendant upon a spontaneous pregnancy in these circumstances, were understood and accepted by the couple and minimized, as far as possible, by the IVF team.\nAn IVF treatment cycle was started using the normal drug regimen, but the patient was given a much lower dose than usual, with the aim of minimizing the effect of the hormone stimulation on the transplanted kidney. Two oocytes (eggs) were obtained, which fertilized normally in vitro, and the two embryos were transferred to the uterus (womb) 54 hours later. Mrs A’s pregnancy test was positive 13 days after embryo transfer, and an ultrasound scan performed at 8 weeks gestation showed a viable twin pregnancy.\nThroughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, the patient’s antirejection drugs (azathioprine and prednisolone) were continued at maintenance doses. Renal function was monitored closely throughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, remaining remarkably stable.\nThe pregnancy was complicated at 20 weeks gestation by a right deep vein thrombosis, affecting the femoral and external iliac veins, and anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was required. Spontaneous rupture of the membranes, leading to premature delivery, occurred at 29 weeks gestation; the twins were delivered vaginally and in good condition three hours later. The twin girls were small for dates (at 1.48 and 1.19 kg) but were otherwise well, requiring only minimal resuscitation and respiratory support. After delivery of her babies, Mrs A remained well and her renal graft continued to function normally, with no change in immunosuppressive or antihypertensive (blood pressure) medication required.",

Her kidney failure followed two prior pregnancies complicated by severe pre-eclampsia and rapid loss of renal function.

After ovarian stimulation, only two embryos are available. She insists both be transferred today because she fears she may not tolerate another cycle and feels time is running out.

Her kidney failure followed two prior pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia and progressive loss of renal function. She now has stable graft function with no recent rejection. Her blood pressure is controlled on medication. Transplant nephrology and maternal–fetal medicine have counseled that any pregnancy could worsen hypertension and threaten the graft. They also advise that a singleton pregnancy may be manageable with close monitoring, but a twin gestation would markedly increase the risk of severe pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and graft loss. Her ovarian reserve has been poor despite high-dose stimulation, and this cycle yielded only two borderline-quality blastocysts. Both embryos have been thawed for transfer and cannot be refrozen, so they must be transferred within hours or discarded. She prefers transferring both to maximize the chance of pregnancy now because she may not be medically able or financially covered to attempt another cycle. The reproductive endocrinologist is concerned about the added maternal, fetal, and graft risks of transferring two. Hospital policy and state law permit either transfer plan with informed consent.",
