      "source_text": "The case of Pekka \nThe Finnish Act on the Status and Rights of Patients \n(enforced in 1993) offers a minor who is mature and \ncapable enough the chance to make decisions about \nhis or her own treatment, but in practice parents \nmake decisions for children under 12. According to \nFinnish mental health legislation, at 12 a child can \nhimself appeal against a compulsory treatment deci- \nsion to an administrative court; the parents also have \na parallel right to make a complaint. A child is an \nindependent subject in his or her own right; the \nchild’s interests can be separate from and even con- \ntrary to the interests of his or her parents. For exam- \nple, Section 7 of the Finnish Act on the Status and \nRights of Patients states that, \n‘The opinion of a minor patient on a treatment \nmeasure has to be assessed with regard to his/her \nage or level of development. . . . If a minor patient \ncan decide on the treatment given to him/her, he/she \nhas to be cared for in mutual understanding with \nhim/her.’ \nThis strong line on children’s autonomy goes \nbeyond law and practice in other Nordic nations, \nsuch as Sweden. However, while a child is said to be \na subject in his or her own right, children usually lack \nresources and means to put their own rights into \npractice. \nDespite this strong ‘child’s voice’ stance, a 1995 \ncase illustrated that these legal criteria are sometimes \nflouted. A boy of 11 – call him Pekka – was treated \nunder a compulsory psychiatric order for ten months, \nagainst his and his mother’s wishes. She managed to \narrange his escape from the institution where he was \nbeing treated and sent him to live secretly with rela- \ntives in Estonia. He only returned after his 12th birth- \nday, when by law his own opinions had to be heard. \nEven more important than the legal position, how- \never, were institutional rules. The psychiatric hospital \nwhere the boy had originally been treated did not \ntake children of 12 and over. The institution for young \npeople over 12 diagnosed the boy as normal; he \nsubsequently lived with his mother and attended a \nnormal school.",
