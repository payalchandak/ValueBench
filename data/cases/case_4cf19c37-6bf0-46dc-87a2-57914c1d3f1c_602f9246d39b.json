      "source_text": "» Case 3-1\nPhysician Participation in Capital Punishment\nMichael Angelo Morales was convicted by the California courts for the\n1981 rape and murder of 17-year-old Terri Winchell and was sentenced to\ndeath. He had beaten her over the head with a hammer and stabbed her in\nthe chest with a knife. He conspired in the murder with his cousin, Rick\nOrtega, who had been in a homosexual relationship with another man who\nwas concurrently dating Winchell. Ortega’s jealousy was purportedly the\nmotive for the attack on Winchell.\nFor twenty-five years the conviction proceeded through the California\ncourts until the much-postponed execution day of February 21, 2006, arrived.\nMr. Morales was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. at San Quentin. U.S.\nDistrict Judge Jeremy Fogel had ordered that, in order to avoid cruelty if the\ndrugs to be used in the execution did not do their job properly, the prison\nhad to have a medical professional present in the death chamber. Two anes-\nthesiologists, whose identity has never been made public, were engaged\nfor this purpose, but, under pressure from medical professional organiza-\ntions, they withdrew two hours before the scheduled execution. The execution\nwas indefinitely postponed. Morales expressed relief. Terri Winchell’s mother\ndescribed the news as “a blow in the stomach.”\nThose critical of the participation of the physicians in the execution cite\nthe AMA's Code of Medical Ethics, which states, “A physician, as a member\nof a profession dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so,\nshould not be a participant in a legally authorized execution.”\nAccording\nto the AMA, this precludes selecting injection sites, starting IV lines, and\nprescribing, preparing, administering, or supervising injection of lethal\ndrugs. For the AMA, this does not extend to testifying about medical history,\ndiagnosis, or mental state; certifying death; witnessing an execution in a\ntotally nonmedical capacity; or relieving the acute suffering of a condemned\nprisoner awaiting execution.\nDefenders of physician participation claim that physicians, as licensed\nmedical professionals, should be involved in order to assure that the state's\ncommitment to avoiding unnecessarily cruel punishment is satisfied.\nIn California, following the postponement of the execution, competing\nbills were introduced into the legisiature by physicians who were members of\nthe California legislature. Senator Sam Aenestad, a general anesthesiologist,\nintroduced legislation to protect physicians who participate in executions\nfrom punishment or professional discipline. Meanwhile, Assemblymen Alan\nNakanishi, an eye surgeon, and a colleague introduced a bill sponsored by\nthe California Medical Association prohibiting physician participation. At\nissue is not only the general ethics of capital punishment but also the ques-\ntion of whether participation of physicians is compatible with their role as\nhealers.",
