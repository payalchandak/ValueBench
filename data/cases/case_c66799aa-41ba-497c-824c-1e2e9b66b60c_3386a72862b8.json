He has\nhad a recent inpatient stay with abdominal pain and has come for the results of some further\ninvestigations he has had as an outpatient. No cause for his pain was found at the time and\nit has not returned. The consultant is also able to reassure the child and his mother that all\nthe other tests have been normal too. The consultant then goes on to bring up the thorny\nsubject of the child’s weight. Although his mother is very slender, it is obvious that Daniel is\nobese. Unfortunately, at the mere mention of his weight, Daniel becomes tearful, and as the\nconsultant pushes on to discuss it further, he gets very distressed and leaves the room.\nQuestions\n• Should the consultant have raised this subject?\n• Would it have made a difference if the consultation was with an adult?\n• What other lifestyle choices should healthcare professionals discuss with their\npatients?",

You have a few minutes left in the visit. The boy has marked obesity on exam, with early stretch marks and mild hypertension noted again today. His mother is thin and says meals are “chaotic” at home. The boy avoids eye contact when clothing size is mentioned. The family drove several hours and says they may not be able to return for many months. You could use the remaining time to start a direct conversation about weight and offer a structured referral, but he appears emotionally fragile and has already had a stressful hospitalization.

        "vignette": "A 12-year-old boy is seen with his mother for a brief post-hospital follow-up after abdominal pain; symptoms have resolved. His exam again shows severe pediatric obesity with stage 1–2 hypertension, without headache, chest pain, or other end-organ symptoms. When weight is mentioned, he becomes visibly panicked and hyperventilates. He says he was recently bullied at school and asks not to discuss weight today. He asks to speak privately, but his mother insists you tell him to diet and refuses to step out. In the hospital he had panic symptoms when staff discussed his size, and his mother reports he sometimes skips meals afterward. Screening questions raise concern for emerging disordered eating behaviors. He has acanthosis nigricans, and hospital labs showed worsening ALT compared with prior records, suggesting evolving metabolic disease. The family drove several hours and is unlikely to return for 6–12 months. The clinic cannot provide telehealth, and the family does not reliably use phone or portals. Pediatric guidance supports addressing obesity over time but allows deferring sensitive counseling when distress or eating-disorder risk is a concern. Deferring counseling today may delay evaluation of progressive metabolic disease; initiating counseling may worsen panic or disordered eating. You have only a few minutes to decide what to do next.",
