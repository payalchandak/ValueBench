      "source_text": "Case 7-4\nRefusing to Learn about Cancer\nWesley Crossman was a 43-year-old real estate broker who had just been\nhospitalized for persistent pain in the bone of his right hip. At first he\nthought he must have pulled a muscle, but the pain gradually became\nmore severe. About six months ago, after he had endured the pain for\nalmost a month, he went to his family physician, who made a tentative di-\nagnosis of arthritis. After several months of treatment with indomethacin,\nan antiarthritic drug, during which time the pain became unbearable, re-\nferral was made to an orthopedic specialist for further tests.\nMr. Crossman was the proprietor of a small agency in a suburb of\nPhoenix, Arizona, in the path of urban growth. Although only marginally\nsuccessful, he earned enough to support his wife and three children, who\nwere now 18, 14, and 12. The rapid development of the area gave him new\nhope for some promising real estate speculation. After overcoming his\nwife's concerns about the financial risks, he invested $20,000 from their\nsavings account in a development project. It would take a few years to pay\noff, but he was tired of making fortunes on land for everyone else while he\nand his family made so little.\nMr. Crossman felt tense when he went to the appointment with Dr. Marvin\nGreenblatt, the orthopedic specialist. He had not said anything explicit to\nhis wife, but they were both thinking about the neighbor who had succumbed\nto bone cancer. During the examination, Mr. Crossman remarked that he\nwas a busy man and mentioned his real estate deal to Dr. Greenblatt when\nhe was asked what he did for a living. Then Mr. Crossman got down to\nbusiness and stated, “Doctor, you do what you have to do to get rid of this\npain,” he said. “Put me in the hospital if you have to, but don't trouble me\nwith all the details. Do what you think is best. Even if it’s awful, I'd just as\nsoon not know.” Both Mr. Crossman and Dr. Greenblatt knew that “cancer”\nwas the word he would not or could not say.\nDr. Greenblatt had seen patients like Mr. Crossman before. Some pa-\ntients give signals, just as clear as can be, that a diagnosis of a terminal\nillness would be more than they could handle psychologically. Dr. Greenblatt\nasked himself, however, “Does he have a right not to know the truth?”",
