He insists that no one at the hospital learn his status. He says he always uses standard precautions and that disclosure would end his career. His schedule includes several exposure-prone operations this week, and he is the only surgeon available for one complex case tomorrow. He asks you to document the diagnosis in a way that will not be visible to employee health or credentialing. Hospital policy allows an infected clinician to continue operating if an oversight panel is involved and certain practice limits are followed, but it also permits physicians to keep the diagnosis confidential if they voluntarily step away from exposure-prone procedures. Hospital counsel confirms either path is legally permissible in this situation. You must decide what to do today.",
