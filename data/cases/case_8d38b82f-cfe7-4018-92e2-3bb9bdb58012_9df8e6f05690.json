      "source_text": "CASE 82:\nPROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY TOWARD\nAN ABUSIVE PATIENT\nBen is a 48-year-old man with terminal metastatic melanoma. Originally diagnosed 3 years\nago, the cancer has spread despite all treatments, including surgical resection, chemotherapy\nand radiotherapy. He is angry at having terminal cancer and has been verbally abusive to\nnumerous staff members, face to face, on the telephone and via email, and including senior\nconsultants, junior doctors, specialist cancer nurses and ward nurses. Ben has made sev-\neral formal complaints against the hospital, in addition to his local District Nursing service\nand community palliative care team. He has, however, maintained strong and friendly\nrelationships with a few oncology team members and his own GP. Ben has had his care trans-\nferred from another hospital and between oncologists at his current hospital due to recurrent\nbreakdowns in relationships with his doctors and nurses due to his behaviour.\nBen attends the emergency department at 2 a.m. with uncontrolled pain. The emergency\ndepartment doctors have referred him to oncology as he is a cancer patient and have refused\nto see him. You are the junior oncology doctor working overnight in the hospital. After\npolitely introducing yourself and appropriately commenting on the difficulties you are aware\nhe is facing from his disease, Ben tells you aggressively to stop being condescending, swears\nat you and makes a derogatory comment about your physical appearance. He demands to see\na senior oncology team member who he says knows his case and he has a good relationship\nwith. You are the only oncology doctor available to see the patient for the next 7 hours when\nthe shift changes.\nQuestions\n• Does a doctor’s duty extend to treating patients who are aggressive and verbally\nabusive?\n• Does it make a difference if the behaviour is as a result of the patient reacting\nbadly to their condition or illness?\n• What if there is no one else able to take over care?",

His disease has progressed despite multiple treatments. He has a long history of verbally abusing clinicians and filing complaints, and his outpatient care has been repeatedly transferred after conflict. You are the junior oncology doctor covering overnight. When you introduce yourself, he swears at you, makes a derogatory comment about your appearance, and demands a senior oncologist he trusts. No senior oncology clinician is available for several hours, and the ED team is asking oncology to direct analgesia because he is on a palliative plan. Hospital policy permits clinicians to set limits and request security support, but it also expects timely symptom relief for patients in distress.
