He uses heroin and cocaine, but he never shares needles and is reliably present at all his clinic visits. He admits that he is often unable to take his medicines regularly when he is using drugs. He is asking about antiretroviral therapy with protease inhibitors. You have just read that HIV viral resistance to protease inhibitors occurs rapidly when patients are unable to take their medicines reliably.\nShould you prescribe protease inhibitors to this patient?\na. No, because the problem of resistance is a real concern in a patient who cannot take his medicines reliably.\nb. No, because the patient is continuing to use heroin and cocaine.\nc. Yes because the patient wants the protease inhibitors.\nd. Yes, because the doctor is under a duty not to abandon the patient and to continue an ongoing therapeutic relationship and encourage him with information and guidance about his HIV disease and issues of addiction.",

He reliably takes daily TMP-SMX prophylaxis. His CD4 count is very low and his viral load is high. He is afebrile today. He has mild oral thrush that is improving on fluconazole. He reports that during periods of increased use his routines break down and he may miss multiple doses. He previously started and stopped ART twice and developed resistance to several first-line drugs, leaving limited remaining options. Because of insurance restrictions, the only regimen you can dispense today is boosted darunavir-based therapy; other options need authorization that will take weeks. He is entering a residential program tomorrow that will not allow outpatient medications until its clinician evaluates him in several weeks, so ART started today would likely be interrupted after 1–2 days, risking virologic rebound and additional resistance. Hospital policy permits either starting ART today or intentionally deferring it in this circumstance. Deferring ART for three weeks at this CD4 level increases his near-term risk of opportunistic infection, hospitalization, or death. You must decide now.",
