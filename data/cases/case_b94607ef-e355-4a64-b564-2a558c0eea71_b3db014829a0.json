      "source_text": "Case 12-9\nStarving an Adolescent to Shape Him Up\nKathleen Barthells has enjoyed her new position for the last two months as\nan occupational therapist on the adolescent psychiatry unit. She feels for-\ntunate to have gotten the job, because the hospital is nationally known and\nthe occupational therapy program is well established. She is involved in\ncare conferences on all of the patients. Her input is valued because of her\nhonesty and insight into the problems of her adolescent patients.\nAt a unit meeting, the chief psychiatrist informs the team that he is going\nto begin using a new type of behavior modification with his patients whose\nbehavior had been diagnosed as an “adjustment disorder with mixed distur-\nbance of emotions and conduct.” He is vague as to the exact type of treatment\nhe plans to use, but he has a solid reputation in the community and the\nhospital, hence the rest of the staff supports him. He admits the majority of\ninpatients on the unit and is therefore quite valuable to the hospital.\nTwo weeks later, Ms. Barthells sits in a care conference on a new ado-\nlescent male patient admitted to the facility by a foster parent. The nurse\nreads the case history. The patient has a history of running away from\nfoster homes, extended absences from school, possible drug use, and a vio-\nlent temper. He is 14 years old. The chief psychiatrist is his attending physi-\ncian. The patient has been in an isolation room for the past two days\nbecause of aggressive behavior shortly after his admission. The psychia-\ntrist says, “I have been withholding food and water from him and intend to\ncontinue with this behavior modification until he is willing to comply with\nthe rules and regulations on the unit.”\nMs. Barthells is not sure if she heard him correctly. She asks for clarifi-\ncation. The psychiatrist replies, “This is a new type of behavior modifica-\ntion therapy that has proved quite effective for recalcitrant youths. He is\nhealthy and a few days without food and water won't hurt him.” The psy-\nchiatrist leaves the group to make rounds. The rest of the care team dis-\ncusses what has happened. A staff colleague asks, “What do you think of\nall this? Is it right?”",

He has a history of running away from foster placements and sudden aggression. After he punches a staff member on admission, he is placed in seclusion. For the past two days, the attending psychiatrist has ordered that no food or fluids be offered until the patient agrees to a written unit safety plan and follows staff directions. The patient intermittently demands water, then spits and throws objects. Nurses document worsening dry mouth and lightheadedness, but he is still awake and oriented. If the restriction is stopped, the team anticipates needing physical restraints and intramuscular sedation to safely provide hydration and meals, which has previously escalated him and caused injury.

He is in seclusion after repeated assaultive behavior toward staff. For the past 48 hours he has taken only a few supervised sips and has refused meals. When drinks or food are brought into the room he sometimes grabs and throws them, and staff have been struck during attempts to retrieve items. He is awake and oriented but highly impulsive. He repeatedly states he will not drink or eat even if it makes him sick. The team is divided about whether he can meaningfully refuse hydration right now. Nursing notes dry mucous membranes and increasing dizziness on standing, though vital signs remain acceptable. His legal guardian is reached by phone and asks staff to avoid force unless medical deterioration is clear. Risk management has approved only two overnight protocols with current staffing. A plan is needed before the night shift.",
