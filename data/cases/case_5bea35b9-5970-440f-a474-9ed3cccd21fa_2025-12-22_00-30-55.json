He denies depression and seems to have a normal mood. He is asking for a prescription or combination of medications that he can take to end his life. He says he will wait for a few weeks or months until he starts to feel weak and then he wants to end his life before he becomes debilitated, bed-bound, or a burden to his family.\nWhich of the following is most appropriate in this case?\na. Provide the pain medications as appropriate but not the means to end his life.\nb. Provide the patient with medications he wants to end his life.\nc.
