The patient developed postoperative chest pain and was\ntransferred to the medical service for further care. She is stabilized\nand receiving morphine for her pain but frequently calls nurses to\nsay that she is uncomfortable. According to the nurse, the patient\ndeveloped an intermittent headache earlier in the day that recurred\nan hour ago after her daughter called to say she would be unable to\nvisit today. When she sees the resident, the patient snaps, \"You look\nso young. I hope you know what you're doing.\" The resident asks a\nfew questions about her headache, but she gives very little\ninformation. When the resident attempts to perform a basic physical\nexamination, the patient yells, \"Don't touch me. I'm going to\ncomplain to the hospital administrators about you because you have\nno idea how to properly deal with a patient.\"\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate response?\na. \"As you may know, this is a teaching hospital; I can assure you that I am well\ntrained and can consult an attending physician if necessary.\"\nb. \"I am sorry you are unhappy with your care; you are free to file a complaint as\ndescribed in the patient bill of rights.\"\nc. \"I see that you're upset; I imagine that you might be disappointed that your\ndaughter was unable to visit.\"\nd. \"I see that you're upset; would you prefer to be seen by my supervising\nattending physician?\"\ne. \"May I ask what is upsetting you so that I can help you as best I can?\"",

She will allow pain medication. Her daughter, listed as emergency contact, cannot be reached tonight, and there is no advance directive on file.
