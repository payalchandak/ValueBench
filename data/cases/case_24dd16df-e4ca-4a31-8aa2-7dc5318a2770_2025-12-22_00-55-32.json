      "source_text": "69. Angela is a 72-year-old woman with end stage congestive heart failure from coronary artery disease--she has had two myocardial infarctions. When her medical management is optimal, she is just able to take care of herself in her own apartment, but with any small decompensation, she ends up in the hospital. She comes in for a clinic visit, and her weight is up 2 kilograms and she is complaining of paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, even though she has been taking her meds as prescribed. Exasperated and discouraged, she asks, \"Am I dying\"? The cardiologist replies: \"Well, no--this is all reversible.\"\nWhat would you, as the medical-legal consultant/ethicist, say to Angela?\na. Agree with the cardiologist that “--this is all reversible.”\nb. Tell the patient that her condition has deteriorated and that she is dying.\nc. Inform the patient that the clinical course of congestive heart failure is unpredictable and includes periods of fairly good function alternating with decompensation right up until death, and that the terminal event is often sudden.\nd. Tell the patient that she needs a hospice referral because her severe end-stage congestive heart failure is terminal.",
