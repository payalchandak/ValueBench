Over the next several weeks the\npatient becomes confused and loses the capacity to understand the\ndetails of her medical care. The husband and son now approach you to\nperform the surgery.\nWhich of the following is most appropriate?\na. Refuse to do surgery and follow the original advance directive.\nb. Perform the surgery only if the request is in writing.\nc. Honor the family’s request and perform the surgery.\nd. Consult the ethics committee.\ne. Perform the surgery only if you really believe that it will benefit the patient in the\nlong term.",

She demonstrated full decision-making capacity at the time, understood her diagnosis and prognosis, and documented her refusal both verbally and in writing. Her husband and adult son disagreed with her decision but accepted it at the time. Several weeks later, the patient develops confusion and loses capacity to understand her medical situation. The family now requests that you proceed with the surgery, arguing that treatment offers her the best chance of survival and that her earlier refusal was made under emotional distress. As her treating physician, you must decide whether to honor her prior refusal or proceed with surgery at the family's request.",
