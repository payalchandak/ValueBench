      "source_text": "CASE 43:\nOUT OF YOUR DEPTH\nOsman is an FY1 doctor currently on call on a night shift in a busy London hospital. An FY2\nand a registrar are working alongside him. Osman is midway through his shift when he\nreceives a bleep saying that he is required to take an arterial blood gas (ABG) from a new\nadmission. The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who has suffered from chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease for 10 years. It is believed that he is suffering from type 2 respiratory\nfailure. Osman tells the patient that he has to take blood to confirm the diagnosis; how-\never, the patient is anxious and agitated. Furthermore, the patient reveals that he has a pho-\nbia of needles and does not want the ABG to be done. Osman states that there is no other\noption and the ABG is essential; however, the patient is becoming more hysterical. Osman is\nunsure of what to do. He is worried about asking the registrar for help, as the registrar stated\nduring the handover meeting at the start of the shift to only bleep him if it is an emergency.\nFurthermore, the registrar has a reputation for being an intimidating figure.\nQuestions\n• What should Osman do in this situation?\n• Who would be held accountable if there were complications from the procedure?\n• Are junior doctors held to the same legal standard of care as consultants?",

A 55-year-old man with severe COPD is newly admitted with increasing drowsiness and breathlessness; the team suspects carbon dioxide retention, and the next steps (whether to start non-invasive ventilation and where to monitor him) depend on confirming his gas levels. When you explain that you want to take an arterial blood sample from his wrist, he becomes panicked and tearful, says he has a lifelong needle phobia, and clearly refuses the procedure. He is able to repeat back what you have told him and insists he would rather “take the risk” than have the needle. Nursing staff offer to hold him still, and there is pressure from the ward to “just get it done” because delays could harm him. You can call the registrar for support, but they have asked not to be contacted unless it is urgent and are known to be intimidating.",
