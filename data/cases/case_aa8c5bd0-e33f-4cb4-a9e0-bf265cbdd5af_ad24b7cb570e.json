      "source_text": "CASE 91:\nRAMADAN AND PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY\nAhmed is a newly qualified doctor and is due to be on-call for 4 days in a row. This involves\nconsecutive 14-hour days and can be very busy and tiring. His on-call week has coincided\nwith the last week of Ramadan and since it is May the hours of darkness where he is allowed\nto eat and drink are more limited. He is adamant that he does not want to break his fast\nduring the on-call as he is a devout Muslim. During the second of his on-call days, the ST2\ntrainee calls in sick and the consultant asks Ahmed to assist with surgery. Things are going\nwell and Ahmed is really enjoying the extra surgical experience and responsibility he is\ngaining. During a lunch break the consultant praises Ahmed’s skills but notices that he has\nnothing to eat or drink at all, not even a glass of water. During the next operation an emer-\ngency arrives in A&E. A 70-year-old man has been diagnosed with a leaking abdominal\naortic aneurysm. He is rushed to theatre and Ahmed is told to scrub. The additional concen-\ntration needed to learn new skills all morning combined with not having eaten is beginning\nto affect Ahmed’s focus, and on several occasions he has to be retold what he needs to do.\nQuestions\n• What does the Qur’an say about Ramadan and illness?\n• What advice should you give Ahmed?\n• Who else can you ask for help in this situation?",
