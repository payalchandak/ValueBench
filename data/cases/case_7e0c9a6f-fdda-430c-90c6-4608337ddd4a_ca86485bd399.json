Case 8-4\n8\nA GP Assisting in Surgical Operations:\nStealing Business and Harming Patients?\nAfter completing a lengthy and prestigious residency program, a young\nsurgeon, Diane Daemer, began the difficult process of establishing a solo\npractice. She took frequent calls from ERs, did insurance physical exams,\nwent to all hospital staff meetings, did not take vacation, and so on. The\npractice grew slowly, and she was gratified when a busy general practitio-\nner, David Parish, referred a patient with lung cancer for her evaluation.\nWhen an operation was recommended, the referring doctor asked to assist\nin the procedure, a custom not unusual in her community. She agreed and\nthe procedure subsequently went well, after her usual meticulous preop-\nerative care and communication with all parties.\nThree weeks later, the same GP referred a patient who needed a par-\ntial resection of the stomach. Again, Dr. Parish assisted in the operation.\nFurther operative cases followed. Then Dr. Parish spoke of his interest in\ndoing “simple operations like hernia repairs and appendectomies” with\nDr. Daemer assisting him. She politely refused, feeling manipulated be-\ncause of the previous referrals, and was unwilling to “cover” the lack of\nsurgical credentials of the other. The surgeon came to believe that the ar-\nrangement was a deception, clearly not in the interest of the patients.",

The operating room can take him within hours. A nearby tertiary center can accept a transfer, but transport will take most of the day and he will remain without definitive treatment during that time. The patient knows you are the surgeon on call. His long-time GP asks to be listed as primary operator for an “uncomplicated appendectomy,” with you assisting. The GP has no formal surgical credentialing beyond minor procedures, but he has been assisting you in cases and wants to “build experience.” Hospital policy and state law allow either a supervised GP operator under your oversight or a surgeon-led case, as long as documentation and consent are completed.

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old man presents with CT-confirmed uncomplicated appendicitis. He is hemodynamically stable but has worsening right lower quadrant pain with nausea and vomiting. The OR can take him within several hours. Transfer to a tertiary center is possible, but transport would delay surgery until later today and he says he will not go unless he has to. He states he will not consent to appendectomy unless his family physician is listed as the operating surgeon of record. The patient asks that his family physician, who has cared for him for years, be listed as the operating surgeon because he distrusts a surgeon he has never met. The family physician has hospital-granted privileges to perform appendectomy only under direct supervision in a rural upskilling pathway. He completed an accredited skills course and has done several supervised appendectomies. Because he is early in this pathway, his operative time and risk of intraoperative complication or conversion are materially higher than a fully credentialed surgeon’s. Hospital policy requires one primary operator of record, with no shared-primary option, and you are the only fully credentialed surgeon available to be immediately scrubbed in and take over. Risk management confirms both choices are legally permissible. You must book the case now and obtain consent.",
