He remains able to communicate clearly and consistently, understands his prognosis, and has no signs of delirium or untreated depression. Over the past year he has lost most limb function and now needs help with nearly all daily activities; he fears an upcoming loss of speech and the possibility of needing a feeding tube or ventilatory support. He says his current quality of life is unacceptable and requests that you provide a clinician-administered life-ending medication at home under your region’s permitted medical assistance-in-dying process. His spouse and adult children know about the request and say they will support whatever he decides. You have already reviewed hospice and symptom-focused options, including ways to manage breathlessness and anxiety as the disease progresses. As the treating physician, which recommendation should you make?",

        "vignette": "Dr. Lin is a family physician in a remote northern community reachable only by a weekly flight. Her long-time patient, Mr. R., is a 58-year-old with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and progressive respiratory failure. He remains cognitively intact and demonstrates clear decision-making capacity: he can explain his condition and prognosis, describes the medical assistance in dying (MAID) process in his jurisdiction, understands alternatives (optimized palliative care, hospice, palliative sedation, and refusing/withdrawing ventilation), and states repeatedly that he knows he can change his mind at any time. Over several visits he has made a persistent, consistent request for MAID, saying he wants to avoid the final phase of paralysis and air hunger.\n\nMr. R. communicates using a speech-generating tablet, but his forced vital capacity is falling rapidly; his neurologist estimates he may lose reliable communication within 2–3 weeks. Local law requires two independent MAID eligibility assessments and confirmation of consent close to the time of provision; once Mr. R. can no longer communicate, MAID will likely be impossible. In practice, the nearest trained MAID assessor is 500 km away with a 4–6 week wait, weather often cancels flights, and Mr. R. cannot safely travel long distances due to tenuous breathing. There is no local MAID coordination service and limited access to backup communication devices.\n\nDr. Lin has a conscientious objection to directly participating in MAID based on deeply held moral beliefs. She worries that providing MAID would violate her moral integrity and cause lasting moral distress, but she also recognizes that refusing could effectively block Mr. R.’s only realistic path to a time-sensitive, autonomous choice in a medically underserved area. Mr. R. says, “I’m asking now while I can still tell you what I want. If I lose my voice, I lose my choice.”",

She documents her moral distress and seeks supervision/peer support afterward, but proceeds to help Mr. R. access MAID within the legal window.",

She simultaneously intensifies palliative care (opioids for dyspnea, anxiolytics, home nursing) and discusses palliative sedation if symptoms become refractory.
