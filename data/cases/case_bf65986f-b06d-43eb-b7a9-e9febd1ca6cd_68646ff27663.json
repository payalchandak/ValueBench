      "source_text": "Case 7-7\nA Psychiatric Patient’s Right to See Her Medical Record\nClaire Mowry was a 38-year-old, single woman who had worked intermit-\ntently over the past ten years as a secretary. She had had difficulty keeping\njobs because she would regularly engage in disputes with fellow employ-\nees, accusing them of not carrying their load of the office work, criticizing\ntheir work, and in one case reporting a fellow worker to the supervisor for\nconsistently showing up late for work.\nCurrently out of work, she was seeing Martin Gaskell, a psychiatrist\nworking with the mental health clinic of the health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO) of her previous employer. Ms. Mowry was currently paying out-\nof-pocket so her HMO coverage could continue.\nDr. Gaskell had now had four appointments with Ms. Mowry. He had\nidentified patterns of what appeared to be paranoid thinking and had\ngenerally come to find her an unpleasant, difficult patient. She clearly did\nnot have a major psychiatric disorder. She was not psychotic—a paranoid\nschizophrenic—but she had personality traits that were causing her\nproblems.\nBy the end of her fourth visit with Dr. Gaskell, Ms. Mowry had become\nconvinced that Dr. Gaskell did not like her. She thought he seemed to be\nimplying that her employment problems were her own fault and that she\nneeded further therapy to address these issues. Ms. Mowry suspected that\nDr. Gaskell was keeping notes on her that would reflect his poor opinion of\nher. She asked to see her medical record.\nWhen Dr. Gaskell hesitated, Ms. Mowry indicated that she would\nreport him to the management of the HMO. Patients in the United States\nhave the right to review their medical records. However, some moral uncer-\ntainty still exists. In particular, many physicians, especially psychiatrists,\nare concerned that granting patients the right to see their records may\nharm patients as well as violate the privacy rights of the provider. Regard-\nless of the law, what is an ethically appropriate decision by Dr. Gaskell?",

After four visits, you document prominent paranoid personality traits and note that she becomes rapidly angry when she feels criticized. Today she arrives agitated and says you “must be writing lies” about her. She demands to read her chart before leaving and says she will file a formal complaint and stop treatment if you refuse. She also reports sleeping poorly and having fleeting thoughts that “it wouldn’t matter if I didn’t wake up,” but denies a plan. You worry that reading your unfiltered impressions could intensify her distrust and dysregulation, yet refusing may deepen her suspicion and end care.
