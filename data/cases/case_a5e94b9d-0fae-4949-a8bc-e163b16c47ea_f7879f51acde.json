      "source_text": "The case of Lisa and Martin\nLisa and Martin are elderly residents in a residential\nhome which caters for people who su er from\ndementia. In general both Lisa and Martin seem to\nbe happy and this appears to be largely the result of\ntheir relationship with one another. During the day\nLisa and Martin are inseparable. They sit holding\nhands, they irt with each other and talk or cuddle\nfor most of the time.\nHowever, despite the genuine happiness both\nLisa and Martin experience the sta at the home are\nconcerned about their relationship. It is apparent\nthat Lisa falsely believes that Martin is her husband\nand that Martin, also falsely, believes that Lisa is his\nwife.\nThis poses several problems for the sta . On the\none hand there is the ethical question raised earlier in\nthe rst section of this chapter of whether they ought\nto adopt a reality orientation approach or one based\non validation. That is, should they encourage the two\nresidents to confront the truth about their relation-\nship or should they respect and validate their feelings\nand the meaning the relationship has for them? On\nthe other hand, in the case of Lisa and Martin there is\na much more pressing ethical dilemma for the sta .\nFor whilst Lisa s husband is in fact deceased, Martin s\nwife is not and comes to visit him on average once a\nweek. This causes practical as well as ethical problems\nfor the sta .\nWhen Martin s wife visits him he sometimes\nrecognizes her, but sometimes he does not. This natu-\nrally upsets his wife. Martin s wife does not appear to\nknow about the relationship between Martin and\nLisa. When she comes to visit, the sta who work in\nthe home try to make sure that Lisa is out or engaged\nin some activity in another room in order to avoid a\nconfrontation. The problem with this is that Martin\nand Lisa desperately want to be together and protest\nwhen they are separated.\nThe sta do not know what to do. This is not, they\nfeel, simply a matter of whether or not they should\nkeep Martin s wife in the dark; it a ects every aspect\nof managing the home. At bed time, for example,\nMartin and Lisa want to sleep together. They have\nsaid this when their respective children have been to\nvisit them and the children have told the sta that\nsuch behaviour cannot be allowed.\nThus far, the sta who work in the home have\nrespected the wishes of the children and have sepa-\nrated Martin and Lisa at bed times despite loud prot-\nest s. The sta nd this very upsetting when they see\njust how unhappy Lisa and Martin are but nd it very\ndi cult to know what they ought to do.",

He spends most days holding hands and kissing another resident, Lisa. Martin repeatedly says he wants to “sleep with my wife,” meaning Lisa, and becomes distressed when staff separate them. At times he recognizes his legal spouse during weekly visits, but at other times he insists Lisa is his spouse and rejects redirection. His adult children demand that Martin and Lisa be kept apart overnight and worry he cannot consent to intimacy. Staff worry that forced separation is worsening his agitation and leading to nighttime wandering and falls. The facility has a private room available now, but assigning it will set the overnight plan going forward.

Martin’s adult children are involved in decisions and urge separation, and there is no documented prior expressed wishes about sexual intimacy for either resident. Staff cannot provide continuous overnight supervision. An unobserved escalation could cause distress, injury, or allegations of exploitation. Sharing a room may reduce Martin’s nighttime agitation and wandering. Separation may better preserve Lisa’s sense of safety. The only private room must be assigned by end of day.
