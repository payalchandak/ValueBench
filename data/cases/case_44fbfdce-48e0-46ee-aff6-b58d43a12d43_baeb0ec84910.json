      "source_text": "I am definitely having it done\nJune Zatz\n\nI remember in 1973, when I was 23 years old, sitting in the hairdresser’s, reading some obscure American magazine. I came across an article about a 19-year- old girl from New York where every female on her mother’s side had contracted breast cancer, going back two or three generations. A decision was taken that she have both breasts removed as this was the only way to ensure that she would not contract the disease herself. I was absolutely aghast when I read this article. This was the first time I learnt that breast cancer was hereditary. My mother, her two sisters and her first cousin had had breast cancer but I never really thought of it as being a threat to me. And the thought of a 19-year-old having such a drastic operation! I never discussed the article with anyone. It was after reading the article that the implications were clearer to me – of contracting the disease. I dismissed as ridiculous the part in the article about the operation, but I know that I stored it away in the back of my mind.\nMy mother had a radical mastectomy when she was 42 years old. As a result of the operation she was left with fluid in her right arm, which caused severe infections where she was bedridden for days. She had bouts of ill-health for years but in between she was a determined lady who never complained. She had a second mastectomy 13 years later followed by various operations and bouts of ill-health. After a benign tumour was removed from her liver when she was 58, her consultant warned my brother and me that ‘cancer will get her sooner rather than later’. Her ultimate illness was when she was 66 years old, short and sharp – cancer of the spine – paralysis – painful – death even now, 7 years later, I cannot think of this period without immense pain.\nMy mother’s younger sister developed breast cancer when she was 46, and after numerous operations and great pain died 2 years later when 48 years old. This was prior to the days of the hospice (where my mother died) and so my mother looked after her, but the pain was not well controlled.\nMy other aunt died when I was only 7 years old. My mother told me she had breast cancer in her early 40s, but also had a heart condition from which she died in her mid-40s.\n\nAfter finding out that breast cancer can be hereditary, I read everything I could get my hands on. Only once when in my mid-20s I attempted to bring up the subject with my mother, as I felt perhaps she could get advice for me from her specialist. But she just dismissed it and refused to discuss it. I never attempted to mention it again. My husband, however, got to know of my fears because I often imagined I felt a lump in my breast. Then I became depressed, lay awake at night imagining all sorts of things and, having two young children, I naturally worried about the children – what would happen if I weren’t around for them? Throughout the years, I only ever went to the doctor twice when the ‘lump’ didn’t seem to disap- pear and I was literally going round the bend. Even when at the doctor’s I managed to conceal my true feelings, was very matter of fact, and he was never aware of the family history as I didn’t tell him.\nMy mother died 7 years ago, when I was 37 years old. Within a few weeks of her death, I realized that I had to do something about my fears and get them out in the open. It was almost as though with her death this released me to discuss my fears out in the open.\nI wrote to my mother’s oncologist detailing the family history and asking whether there was anything else I should be doing apart from self-examination. This resulted in me being referred to an oncology clinic for regular monitoring, initially 6-monthly, then annually. These visits to the clinic I can only describe as horrendous. First of all there was the waiting area where females of all ages (many surprisingly young) were waiting to find out whether they had breast cancer or because they already had it. Then, in the cubicles while waiting to be examined, you could hear the registrar in the next cubicle talking to the patient and I knew from the conversation that all was not well. By the time I was due to be examined, I would be a wreck – then the mammogram; then the waiting a week for the result. After the result I would be elated, my first thought would be thank God, I will be around for another year. I would immediately calculate all my children’s ages. This was what was of prime importance for me – I wanted to be around to see them into adulthood.\nAs I neared the age when my mother developed her first breast cancer, I became more fearful. Over the years I had read many articles and I did not feel that treatments were any more effective today than years ago, even if it were detected at an earlier stage. I felt that I would get breast cancer as my body was similar to my mother’s in many ways – she had fibroids and a hysterectomy – she had gall stones and had her gall bladder removed. I had had both these operations by my late 30s.\nMy mind kept casting back to the article I’d read all those years ago about the 19-year-old who had both breasts removed as a preventative measure. I had never read of this again but decided it was time to pursue it further. In the summer of 1991 I wrote to my oncologist asking if such an operation were possible. His answer took a fairly long time coming, mainly due to admin- istrative procedures. While I waited for the reply, I was on tenterhooks: my feelings were that I would be told that I was crazy, that this operation could be done only in America.\nEventually when his letter arrived stating that yes, I could have this operation – I literally couldn’t believe it – I read the letter over and over for days. Then I wrote another long letter with lots of questions. There followed several letters to and fro: a referral to a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstruction and a referral to a specialist cancer geneticist to discuss the genetic side of things.\nIt took me months to make up my mind definitely. After the second letter from the oncologist, I told my husband what I was investigating and he was horror- struck. He just could not understand why I should have both breasts removed when they were perfectly healthy. To him the logical thing was to wait and, if the cancer appeared, then it will have been caught early, then I should have a mastectomy. He didn’t understand that, the way I saw it, it was too late by then. At this stage, however, I hadn’t made up my mind and in fact because of my husband’s attitude I put things on hold for several weeks. One day, however, I woke up early feeling such anger and resentment towards him – he and I had always until now agreed on major issues.\nI discussed it with him again. This time I had a different attitude: he had made me feel selfish contem- plating such an operation but what I said to him was: ‘What about me, my fears; this is my life and who’s going to look after me if I get cancer – will he nurse me?’ At the same time I said I hadn’t yet made up my mind but I was going to continue my inves- tigations whether he liked it or not. He listened and said he’d like to come with me when I next had a consultation with either the oncologist or the plastic surgeon. I refused as I knew he was still against it but said I’d tell him everything they said.\nSome days I would wake up and say, ‘I’m definitely having it done’. Other days I’d think I was crazy – I tried to imagine what it would be like without breasts, although there was the chance of reconstruction. Gradually my husband came round to my way of thinking. The more information I gathered the more he understood what I could be facing. One day I said, ‘I don’t think I’ll have it done’, and then to my surprise he said, ‘You should go ahead – I’d rather have you alive and well with no breasts’.\nIn April 1992 I made the decision to have the operation. Throughout the 6 months it took me to come to this decision I had several consultations with the three specialists. The clinical geneticist put me in touch with another lady who had had a similar oper- ation. She had an almost identical family history to mine. I had a long discussion with her on the phone. It was invaluable to talk to someone who had been in my situation. She and her sister had had the operation and were greatly relieved that the chance of breast cancer had been removed.\nThe only people who knew about it were my husband, my two children and two friends, one of whom had a medical background and the other was a cousin to whom I’m very close and with whom I’d often discussed the ‘family history’. I instinctively knew from the beginning that I didn’t want anyone’s advice on the matter, I wanted facts on which I could base my decision. The professionals were wonderful. Everyone was patient, answered my questions, was quietly supportive and never offered advice on what I should do. I should also point out that they were all males.\nAt the time my daughter was 18 years old and my son 16. They knew what was happening but my daughter could not understand my contemplating such an operation, so I didn’t discuss it with her, and my son couldn’t deal with it at all perhaps due to his age and sexuality.\nThe plastic surgeon had discussed the breast reconstruction he would be performing, which involved a lengthy operation. At the same time as performing the mastectomies, he would remove fat and muscle from my stomach and use this to form new breasts. It was a complicated procedure and there was also a chance that it wouldn’t work. I asked myself, could I cope with having no breasts? I’d deci- ded not to have silicone implants because of recent bad publicity. I concluded that disfigurement was of secondary importance to the certainty of not getting breast cancer. Since 12 years of age I’d been surrounded by this disease and here was a way to get rid of it.\nFrom the time of making my decision in April 1992 I never looked back once. Now I had to decide when to tell people because I’d be in hospital for 2 weeks and off work for a couple of months. I had lunch with a close friend and started to tell her. She was so aghast that I didn’t finish telling her about the reconstruction. I couldn’t wait to get away from her. She just couldn’t hide her feelings. After this I told a few more people but got more or less the same reaction. I was furious and upset. The way I saw it I had made a very difficult decision and these supposed close friends were completely unsympathetic. They made comments like ‘Do you know what you are doing?’ or ‘Why remove your breasts when you haven’t got cancer?’\nI told my doctor friend who had known from the beginning and she said, ‘They’re so busy trying to deal with their own feelings that they can’t focus on you and provide support for you’. I realized just what a threat this seemed to be to other women to have one’s breasts removed. I told my husband I couldn’t tell anyone else so he said to make a list and he would sit down and phone them. I gave him half a dozen names and he did it immediately as I didn’t want these people to find out from others. Needless to say I received a few phone calls from people we’d not told, to say that they’d heard about it; again they were very unsupportive. Despite the lack of help I never faltered.\nThe operation was performed in September 1992. I was really quite ill, which was to be expected. The plastic surgeon was so attentive and kind that somehow, even though I felt very ill, so long as he was looking after me I knew everything would be OK. I was fortunate in that the reconstruction was successful. While lying in hospital I became obsessed with the imminent pathology result of both breasts. ‘What if I’m too late and the cancer was already there?’ Prior to the operation I remember saying to the surgeon, ‘Please cut everything out. I didn’t want any chances taken.’ It took about 10 days for the pathology results and when I was told that everything was OK, I\n...[TRUNCATED]",

        "vignette": "A 34-year-old woman with a confirmed pathogenic BRCA1 mutation (no personal history of breast cancer) meets with a breast surgical oncologist to discuss breast cancer risk reduction. The surgeon explains that she is medically eligible for risk-reducing bilateral mastectomy and that both enhanced surveillance (annual MRI and mammography with clinical exams) and prophylactic mastectomy with reconstruction are clinically acceptable, guideline-concordant options.\n\nOver three visits spanning 4 months, the patient consistently states that she wants surgery. She accurately summarizes the expected risk reduction, alternatives (continued surveillance and chemoprevention), and the irreversible consequences (loss of native breast tissue and sensation), along with surgical risks (bleeding, infection, implant loss, need for revisions). A mental health evaluation documents that she has decisional capacity and can reason about outcomes; her preference has been stable, though she reports significant health anxiety that peaks around imaging and has led her to miss a scheduled MRI.\n\nThe surgeon is concerned that her anxiety may be unduly driving an irreversible decision that could later cause regret. The patient says delaying has concrete consequences: her insurance preauthorization for reconstruction expires in 8 weeks, and she has a coordinated oncologic/plastic surgery operating room slot now but would face a 9–12 month reconstruction waitlist if she misses it. She reports ongoing distress and avoidance of surveillance while waiting.",
