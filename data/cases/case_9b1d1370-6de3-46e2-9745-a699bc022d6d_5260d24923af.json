Both parents are practising Muslims and want him to be\ncircumcised for religious reasons. He was not circumcised at birth in accordance with\ncustom because he had been in special care due to complications from congenital heart\ndisease. Although the boy is now thriving, due to his underlying condition a general\nanaesthetic would present a heightened risk. As there are no clinical indications for circum-\ncision, the urologist is uncertain about whether to proceed, despite the parents’ insistence\nthat circumcision is performed.\nQuestions\n• Is neonatal circumcision for religious or social reasons ethically and legally\nappropriate?\n• Do the increased risks of circumcision being performed in the community justify\nNHS provision of the procedure even if it is not clinically indicated?",

He was not circumcised as a newborn because he required prolonged neonatal care for complex congenital heart disease.

The child resists genital exams and cannot meaningfully understand the procedure. His parents are clear that this is important to their family and want it done soon before an upcoming community celebration. If the hospital declines, they say they will arrange circumcision outside the hospital. Hospital policy and state law allow elective circumcision with parental consent, and also permit the surgeon to refuse nonindicated surgery.
