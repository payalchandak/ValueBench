She studied a nthropology\nat university and had been in a long-term relationship. After leaving university with a good\ndegree, she struggled to get a job. She eventually found work in a restaurant, which she\nseemed to enjoy. Last year her boyfriend moved out and she decided to quit her job and move\nback home. Over the past year her family has become increasingly worried about her health\nand behaviour. Her personal care has deteriorated and she has slowly withdrawn from inter-\nacting with her family. She has not bothered to find a job locally and only leaves her bedroom\nto wash and get food from the kitchen. Kate has also begun to clean her hands obsessively\nalthough otherwise she does not seem to wash. Her room smells stale and she has refused to\nlet her mum change her bedding. She does not seem to change her clothes and does not allow\nthem to be washed with the family clothes. Her mother has noticed that Kate’s hands are raw\nand that she has sores on her back and her legs. She refused to speak to a GP about her mood,\nand in desperation Kate’s parents have spoken to their GP about what can be done. The GP\nwas concerned enough to attempt a home visit, but on arrival Kate refused to come out of her\nroom, saying that she was just having a break from the stresses of living.\nQuestions\n• Could Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n• Should Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?",

She stays in her bedroom most of the day, rarely changes clothes, will not allow anyone to enter her room or wash her bedding, and has developed repetitive hand-washing that has left her hands cracked and bleeding; her mother has also noticed untreated sores on her legs and back. She refuses to attend the surgery or speak with you, and during a home visit she will only speak through the door, insisting she is “just taking a break from stress” and does not want any help. The family report she is no longer working, is eating irregularly, and becomes agitated if they raise the idea of seeing a clinician.

Her thought process becomes tangential and she cannot consistently explain how she will meet basic needs if discharged. \n\nWhen the clinician attempts a structured decision-making capacity assessment (understanding, appreciation, reasoning, ability to express a choice), she refuses to participate—repeating, “You can’t evaluate me”—and will not allow repeat vital signs, labs, or a physical exam.

The team is uncertain whether her refusal represents an informed, capacitated decision or is driven by possible psychosis or OCD-like contamination fears impairing her ability to appreciate risk.\n\nUnder local law, involuntary evaluation can be initiated if there is imminent risk of serious harm or an inability to provide for basic needs, but it is unclear whether she meets the legal threshold at this moment given incomplete assessment and her refusal to cooperate.",
