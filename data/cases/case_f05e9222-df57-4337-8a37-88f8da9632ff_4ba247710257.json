        "vignette": "You are the attending cardiologist in a tertiary ICU caring for a 45-year-old with refractory cardiogenic shock after a large myocardial infarction. They are awake on high-dose vasoactive support and an intra-aortic balloon pump, and they and their partner are asking for “anything that might keep me alive.” The team believes veno-arterial ECMO could potentially stabilize them long enough to assess recovery or candidacy for longer-term support, but the patient is already developing kidney and liver injury and would likely require days to weeks of intensive, staff-heavy care if ECMO is started. Your hospital’s regional ECMO program has one circuit and perfusion team available, and activating it now would force the unit to decline other transfer requests and postpone scheduled cardiac surgeries that rely on the same personnel and equipment. There is no time to convene a full regional review, and you must decide whether to activate ECMO for this patient tonight.",

He is intubated but awake and intermittently following commands on light sedation. A bedside capacity assessment finds he can communicate a consistent choice, understands the information provided, appreciates likely outcomes, and can reason about options. After counseling about VA-ECMO (including bleeding/stroke risk, limb ischemia, infection, uncertain benefit, and the possibility of prolonging dying), he states clearly: “I want you to put me on ECMO if that gives me any chance—do everything.” He has no advance directive on file; his spouse confirms he has repeatedly expressed a preference for aggressive life-prolonging treatment.\n\nDespite norepinephrine, epinephrine, vasopressin, and an intra-aortic balloon pump, he remains hypotensive with rising lactate (8.5 mmol/L), worsening metabolic acidosis, anuric acute kidney injury, and transaminases consistent with shock liver. The ECMO team estimates that without VA-ECMO he is likely to die within hours. With VA-ECMO, there is a small but real chance of survival to discharge with meaningful neurologic recovery (estimated 10–20%), but his prognosis remains poor given evolving multi-organ failure and unclear candidacy for durable LVAD/transplant.\n\nThe regional VA-ECMO program is operating under a stewardship policy: when circuits are scarce, they should be allocated to patients most likely to benefit, and the center must preserve capacity for time-sensitive referrals. Tonight, the unit has only one available VA-ECMO circuit; if it is used now, the program cannot accept another VA-ECMO patient overnight. The transfer center has alerted the team to a likely incoming request within 2–3 hours: a 28-year-old postpartum patient with fulminant myocarditis in refractory shock with high expected recovery if cannulated.\n\nThe patient’s blood pressure continues to fall, and the team believes a decision about cannulation is needed within 30–60 minutes to avoid irreversible end-organ injury.",
