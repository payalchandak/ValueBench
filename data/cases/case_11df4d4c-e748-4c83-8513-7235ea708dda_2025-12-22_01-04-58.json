        "vignette": "During a regional disaster, a hospital ICU is operating under declared crisis standards of care. Only one dialysis-capable ICU room remains available, and all continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) machines are in use.\n\nA 56-year-old man was admitted 36 hours ago with septic shock from a perforated diverticulitis. After source control surgery, antibiotics, and vasopressors, he is now hemodynamically improving and following commands on minimal sedation. He has acute kidney injury requiring CRRT, but the ICU team expects meaningful recovery and hospital discharge with continued support (estimated short-term survival >80%).\n\nThe patient is unrepresented: he arrived alone, has no emergency contacts listed, and has no advance directive in the chart. Social work has checked the wallet/phone, contacted the listed primary care clinic, searched state registries, and called local shelters; no surrogate has been found. The patient is intermittently delirious and lacks decision-making capacity. An ethics consult and the hospital’s triage committee are available.\n\nTwo other patients in the ED are waiting for a dialysis-capable ICU bed: (1) a 28-year-old with crush injury and hyperkalemia who is expected to survive if started on CRRT within hours; and (2) a 42-year-old with toxin-induced rhabdomyolysis and refractory acidosis who also has a good chance of survival with timely CRRT. The triage policy allows reassessment and potential reallocation of scarce ICU/CRRT resources when doing so is expected to save more lives, but it also requires due process (triage committee review) and documentation that the current patient’s prognosis is substantially worse than those waiting.\n\nThe ICU attending must decide whether to continue life-sustaining treatment for the unrepresented patient or initiate triage-guided reallocation of dialysis-capable ICU resources.",
