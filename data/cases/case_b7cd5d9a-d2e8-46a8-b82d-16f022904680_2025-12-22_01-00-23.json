      "source_text": "Case 18-1\nThe Dying of Pelle Lindbergh: His Brain Is Gone, but Is He Dead?\nAt 5:41 a.m. Sunday morning, November 10, 1985, Philadelphia Flyers star\ngoaltender, Pelle Lindbergh slammed his 1985 Porsche into a cement wall\nof a Somerdale, New Jersey, elementary school. The following summary is\nexceprted from reports from Washington Post staff writer David Sell. While\nall details may not be accurate or conceptually clear, they all reflect state-\nments that can commonly be heard in clinical contexts when discussing\npatients with severe brain injuries.\nFlyers Goalie Lindbergh is Declared Brain Dead\nPhiladelphia, Nov. 10 [Sunday]—Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Pelle Lind-\nbergh was hovering near death tonight in a suburban Philadelphia hospital\nafter he suffered severe brain and spinal cord injuries. Lindbergh was listed\nin critical condition in the intensive care unit of John F. Kennedy Hospital in\nStratford, N.J. The brain damage was compounded by the fact that Lindbergh\nwent without breathing for approximately 15 minutes as rescuers tried to free\nhim from the wreckage.\nSomerdale detective Charles Pope said he arrived at the crash site five\nminutes after the accident occurred. \"He was more or less all mangled up\nunder the steering wheel,” said Pope. He said that after Lindbergh was re-\nmoved from the car his heart stopped beating and CPR was administered.\nReferring to his parents, who were called from Sweden to be at his side, Vicki\nSantoro, nursing supervisor at the hospital said, “They were just devastated.”\nFlyers’ team physician Edward Viner said that if Lindbergh's situation\ndoes not improve, the family will be left with a decision about how long to leave\nhim on the respirator.\n“He's a person that loves life,” [flyers Coach Mike] Keenan said of\nLindbergh.\nStratford, NJ Nov. 11 [Monday]—The injuries to Lindbergh ... left the\ngoalie brain dead. With cardiac stimulants and fluid replacement to keep his\nblood pressure up, Lindbergh was still alive tonight, but with no chance to\nsurvive. :\n“We simply now work with the family to decide how far they want to go\nin sustaining his biological life,” said Dr. Lewis Gallo, one of the hospital doc-\ntors assigned to the case. Withouta respirator, Gallo added, Lindbergh would\nstop breathing “in a matter of minutes.”\nViner said the respirator keeping Lindbergh alive would be discon-\nnected “as soon as they can come to grips with this as a family. ... I’m con-\ncerned about the father’s own health. He's not well and I understand he has a\nsignificant heart condition.”\nStratford, NJ, Nov. 12 [Tuesday]—Pelle Lindbergh, the Philadelphia Flyers\ngoalie who had been brain dead since a car crash early Sunday morning,\nwas declared dead tonight after surgeons removed all his oat organs for\npossible transplantation.\nLindbergh, 26, who suffered extensive brain and spinal injuries, was of-\nficially declared clinically dead Monday morning while his heart and lungs\nwere kept functioning only through the use of a respirator.\nTeam Captain Dave Poulin said, “If his organs can be donated that will\nhelp others and Pelle will live on.”",
