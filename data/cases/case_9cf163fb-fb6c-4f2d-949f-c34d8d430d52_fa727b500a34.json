His own mother died of the condition before Alison was born. Alison wants to know whether she, too, will develop Huntington’s disease. Her parents, who have accompanied her to the surgery, support her wish. Alison’s mother is herself contemplating genetic testing for the BRCA1 gene implicated in some breast cancers, following the death of her own mother and her elder sister from the disease.\nYou know that the clinical genetics unit which serves your patients will not test young people under 18, although Alison can have counselling. You point out that even those over 18 must undergo counselling before having the test, according to the unit’s careful protocol. Alison thinks this over and replies: ‘I can see the point of having some talks with the counsellor first. But if I do decide I want it, do I still have to wait another three years before I can actually have the test?’",

She understands that a predictive test could tell her whether she carries the same mutation. There is no medical treatment she would start now based on the result. She says the uncertainty is consuming her and she wants to know before she starts a new school term in another city in a few weeks. She asks you to help her get tested now. Your regional genetics clinic will provide counselling but generally does not test people under 18. Her parents support testing and will consent. You worry about the potential psychological impact of a positive result and how an irreversible label might affect her future opportunities and family relationships.
