      "source_text": "Case 13-2\nThe Murder of Tatiana Tarasoff: The Therapist’s Duty to Warn\nProsenjit Poddar, a graduate student at the University of California, had a\nromantic interest in a fellow student named Tatiana Tarasoff. She did not\nreciprocate that interest, which led to Mr. Poddar’s depression. He eventu-\nally sought the assistance of the Dr. Lawrence Moore, a psychologist at the\nCowell Memorial Hospital at the university. Mr. Poddar confided his inten-\ntion to kill Tatiana.”!\nThat Dr. Moore took the threat seriously is confirmed by his notifying\nthe campus police, who briefly detained Mr. Poddar but soon released him\nwhen he appeared rational to them. Dr. Moore's supervisor, Dr. Harvey\nPowelson, directed that no further action be taken. Ms. Tarasoff was out of\nthe country visiting an aunt in Brazil. Neither Ms. Tarasoff nor her parents\nwere warned of the threat. When the young woman returned Mr. Poddar\nbegan stalking her and eventually stabbed her to death.\nMs. Tarasoff's parents sued Dr. Moore, Dr. Powelson, the campus police,\nand the university, alleging that they failed to warn Tatiana or her parents\nand failed to see that Mr. Poddar was confined.\nMany psychiatrists, psychologists, and police came to the defense of\ntheir colleagues in this case. Their professional associations entered the\ncase on their behalf. Those focusing on the health professional's duty\nargued that danger to others is not accurately predictable, but even if it\nwere, the duty of the psychologist or psychiatrist in this case is to the pa-\ntient, not to third parties. Furthermore, they contended that a policy requir-\ning a duty to warn would dissuade potential patients from seeking\nprofessional assistance, thus eliminating a potential benefit to the one in\ndanger.\nThose supporting the parents argued that the duty of a professional\ncannot be limited to the patient when the health professional has knowl-\nedge of a serious and credible threat of grave bodily harm.\nThe police were found according to state law to be immune from liabil-\nity and had no duty to warn. The medical personnel were immune from\nfailing to confine Mr. Poddar but concluded they could face charges of fail-\nure to warn. The court concluded:\nWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profes-\nsion should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of vio-\nlence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect\nthe intended victim against such danger. The discharge of this duty may\nrequire the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon\nthe nature of the case. Thus it may call for him to warn the intended victim\nor others likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to notify the police,\nor to take whatever others steps are reasonably necessary under the\ncircumstances.”\nWhile a court case determines only what the law in that jurisdiction\nrequires, it is also important to ask what was ethically appropriate and\nwhether the legal conclusion is, in fact, an appropriate resolution or\nwhether the law should be changed.",

In today’s session he describes persistent thoughts of killing his former partner, a classmate. He names her, describes where she lives, and says he recently bought a knife.

He has no family locally and cannot give you another collateral contact. The former partner is expected back on campus tomorrow after travel.

He reports recently acquiring a weapon and says he could access her when she returns to campus for classes tomorrow. He explicitly refuses you contacting campus security or the former partner. He says he will leave immediately and will not go for emergency evaluation if confidentiality is not maintained. He refuses hospitalization and says any disclosure will end treatment and likely trigger campus discipline and loss of his student visa. The former partner is also a student and is unaware of the risk, so she cannot take precautions unless informed. You can offer a same-day emergency psychiatric evaluation, but mobile crisis cannot arrive before he leaves, and in your jurisdiction an involuntary hold requires stated imminent intent, which he continues to deny. Clinic leadership confirms that either urgent escalation of care with confidentiality or a limited protective disclosure is legally permissible. You must decide before he leaves the office.",
