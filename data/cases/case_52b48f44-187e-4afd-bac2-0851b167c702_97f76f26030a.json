      "source_text": "The case of Sue Axon\nSue Axon is the mother of five children, including two teenage daughters. She objected to guidance, issued in 2004 by the Department of Health in England, which permitted doctors to provide abortion advice or contraception to young people under 16 without the knowledge of their parents. The guidelines, she argued, served to ‘undermine the role of parents’. Ms Axon’s claim was reminiscent of a well-known earlier case, which had led to a ruling in the highest English court, the House of Lords (Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA [1985]). In that case, Victoria Gillick unsuccessfully argued that parents should have to provide consent before a young person could be prescribed the contraceptive pill. Ms Axon’s claim was different: she was not arguing for the right to consent but, instead, the right to know if her child was seeking such advice or treatment. She claimed that she was owed an obligation under ‘article 8 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (which",

        "vignette": "A 15-year-old comes to an adolescent medicine clinic requesting contraception and STI testing. She says she is sexually active with an older boyfriend and does not want her mother told. She fears being thrown out of the home if her mother finds out, but she denies current physical abuse and has no safe alternative housing. Her exam is unremarkable. She understands the options and can explain risks, benefits, and follow-up. Her mother calls the clinic during the visit and demands to know why her daughter is there, saying she has a right to be informed about any sexual health care. The patient becomes tearful and says she will leave and never return if her mother is contacted. Clinic policy and state law allow confidential contraceptive care for minors, and also allow clinicians to require parental involvement when they judge it necessary for the patient’s welfare. You must decide before the visit ends because the patient says she will not come back.",

        "vignette": "A 15-year-old requests contraception and STI testing at an adolescent medicine visit. She reports consensual sex with her 18-year-old boyfriend. Screening for coercion and assault is negative, and the relationship does not trigger mandatory reporting in this state. She demonstrates capacity for informed consent. She has poorly controlled epilepsy and takes valproate, a highly teratogenic medication. She has missed recent follow-up appointments. You worry she may not use contraception reliably or complete needed monitoring without adult support, increasing risk of fetal exposure if she becomes pregnant. She asks that her mother not be told. She fears severe punishment and possible loss of housing, and she says she would avoid future care if her mother learns. Her mother calls during the visit and demands the reason for the appointment. State law and clinic policy permit confidential contraceptive care for minors but allow clinician-directed parental involvement when necessary for the patient’s welfare. Breaching confidentiality could also deter other adolescents from seeking legally permitted care. Social work is unavailable today, and no confidential follow-up slots are available soon.",
