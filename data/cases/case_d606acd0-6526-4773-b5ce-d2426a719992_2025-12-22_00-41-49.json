He decided to try palliative chemotherapy because \"otherwise I might just as well roll over and give up.\" After the first cycle of carboplatin and taxol, he requires hospitalization for fever and neutropenia (a complication of the chemotherapy). You stop by for a visit, and he says he feels terrible, wonders \"if the chemo is worth all this\", but that he's too scared to stop.\nHow would you handle this situation?\na. Encourage the patient to discontinue the palliative chemotherapy because it is an intervention providing, on average, a small benefit at considerable toxicity in metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.\nb. Stop the palliative chemotherapy based of the side effects and medical futility.\nc. Be certain that the patient is well informed understands the benefits and burdens and wishes to proceed with the trial and palliative chemotherapy .\nd. Stop chemotherapy and start hospice care .",
