Sally has a progressive neurological condition and she now has limited verbal\ncommunication, worsening mobility and some elements of dementia. Her life expectancy is\naround 4 years. Sally is frustrated by her condition and the prospect of her future deteriorat-\ning health and reliance on her husband. She says to Zayn that she has been in contact with\nDignitas in Switzerland and intends to go there for assisted suicide. Her husband and two\nadult children oppose this but are prepared to go with her if there is no way of changing her\nmind.\nSally has rejected all other forms of counselling and Zayn feels that he should not abandon\nSally but rather provide a sounding board for her thoughts and offer support for her family.\nQuestions\n• What support can Zayn offer Sally?\n• Are Sally’s children at risk of prosecution if they take Sally to Dignitas for assisted\nsuicide?\n• Should assisted suicide be lawful?",

She can still describe her goals and understands that she may live for years but expects increasing dependence. She tells you, her palliative care physician, that she plans to travel soon to pursue an assisted death. She asks you to write a summary letter, share records, and talk through the process with her and her family. Her husband and adult children oppose the plan but say they will accompany her if she remains determined. You worry that grief, untreated depression, or fluctuating capacity may be driving the request, and that engaging could normalize self-harm. You also worry that refusing to discuss it will isolate her and make her act in secrecy. Hospital counsel confirms either approach is legally permissible here. She wants an answer before finalizing travel plans next week.",

Depression screening did not suggest major depression. Her attention can fluctuate with fatigue and hypercapnia. Despite optimized palliative care, she has recurrent air hunger with panic that she describes as intolerable, though she is often comfortable between episodes. She plans to travel next week to a clinic in another jurisdiction that offers a hastened-death process. The clinic requires a treating clinician’s letter and recent records. She asks you to provide them and to review her plans with her family. Her husband and adult children oppose the plan but want to stay involved. Providing documentation could enable an irreversible, premature death if fluctuation impairs capacity at the visit. Refusing could prolong distress or lead her to pursue hastened death without her treating team’s support. No psychiatry or formal capacity consultation is available before her travel deadline.",
