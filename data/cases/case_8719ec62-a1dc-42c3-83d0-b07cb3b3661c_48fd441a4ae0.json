She already has three sons and she and her husband decided to\nhave another child in the hope of having a daughter. Sophie and her own mother had a very\nclose bond growing up, and she had dreamt of recreating the mother–daughter bond with her\nown child. This desire had been made stronger due to the recent death of her own mother.\nYou are her GP and when she comes to see you she is visibly distressed. She confides that\nshe has already booked an appointment with a counsellor at the British Pregnancy Advisory\nService. She does not want to continue with the current pregnancy as she does not feel she\ncould give enough love to another son. She also tells you that her husband is supportive of any\ndecision she chooses to make as he too has a preference to have a daughter.",

She asks you to help her proceed with an abortion and says she already contacted an abortion service for a soon appointment.

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old at 20 weeks’ gestation asks about pregnancy termination after a normal anatomy scan. She reports recent bereavement and strong disappointment about fetal sex. For 1 month she has had persistent low mood, severe insomnia, intrusive ruminative thoughts, and difficulty caring for her three children. She was previously hospitalized for severe postpartum depression. She denies current thoughts of harming herself or others and has no mania or psychosis. On exam she is coherent, understands options, and can explain consequences. You are concerned that continuing the pregnancy may trigger rapid psychiatric deterioration and possible rehospitalization, with risk of neglect of her existing children. In your setting, termination at this gestation requires two clinicians to attest that continuation poses a serious mental-health risk. Clinicians may decline but must arrange timely transfer. If you decline today, she is unlikely to obtain a second signature or transfer before the local gestational cutoff, and termination access will effectively be blocked. Second-trimester termination also carries higher procedural risk. The termination provider requires your signed certification today, and the earliest perinatal psychiatry assessment is after the cutoff. She refuses any delay and plans to disengage from care if you do not act today.",
