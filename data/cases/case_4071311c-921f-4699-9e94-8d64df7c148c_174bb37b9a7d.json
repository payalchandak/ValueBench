        "vignette": "A 48-year-old detainee is held in a secure facility for questioning after a major public-safety incident. He has stable vital signs, no acute complaints, and appears to have decision-making capacity. Security leaders plan an interrogation starting within the hour that includes prolonged standing with restraints, environmental cold, and sleep restriction. They describe it as compliant with humane-treatment standards but acknowledge it can cause syncope, rhabdomyolysis, or arrhythmia. They ask you to be present with continuous pulse oximetry and cardiac monitoring and to provide IV fluids and airway support if he decompensates so questioning can continue. The detainee refuses any medical involvement and requests only routine care in his cell. Command says the session will proceed regardless and will not accept a stop-the-session role; if you do not attend, you will not be allowed to evaluate him again until hours later. Counsel confirms either course is legally permitted under current policy. You must decide whether to assist.",
