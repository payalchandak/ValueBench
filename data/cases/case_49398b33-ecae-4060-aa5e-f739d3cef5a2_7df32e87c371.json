He remains independent but has worsening fatigue and intermittent abdominal pain controlled with medication. He fears a prolonged decline from bowel obstruction or delirium. He wants the option available before he loses capacity. He is scheduled for port placement and chemotherapy next week, and sedation or rapid decline could prevent completing required evaluations. He has made one prior formal oral request, and today is the next visit allowed under the statute. He appears to understand his diagnosis, hospice and symptom management alternatives, and that MAID involves self-administering medication that will intentionally and irreversibly hasten death. He denies substance misuse, and you do not observe delirium or coercion. His adult daughter objects while his spouse supports him. A consulting physician can confirm eligibility. An external MAID provider cannot see him for several weeks and may require restarting the request timeline, which could jeopardize access and increase the risk of the prolonged suffering he fears. State law and hospital policy permit either participation or conscientious refusal with referral. You must decide your role today.",
