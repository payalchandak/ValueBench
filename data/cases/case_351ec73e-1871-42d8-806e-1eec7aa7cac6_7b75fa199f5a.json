She subsequently develops a postpartum hemorrhage\nand informs the doctors of her refusal to receive blood products, if they are needed in treat-\nment, because she is a Jehovah’s Witness.\nJoshua, age 15, sustained multiple injuries in a car accident. He refuses blood products\nbecause he is a devout Jehovah’s Witness.\nA newborn baby has been diagnosed with a serious heart condition requiring surgery. His\nparents consent to him undergoing the cardiac surgery, but because of their religious beliefs\nthey cannot consent to him receiving blood during the course of that surgery or subsequently,\nif it is needed.\nA 27-year-old devout Jehovah’s Witness, Gemma, is attacked whilst walking home from\nwork. A passer-by calls an ambulance and she is rushed to A&E, where she is found to have a\nruptured spleen. She is unconscious but she is carrying a document that informs doctors that\nshe does not wish to receive a blood transfusion even if the outcome would be death. When\nGemma’s husband arrives, he informs the doctors that her wishes have not changed since\nsigning the document.\nQuestions\n• What is the religious constraint on Jehovah’s Witnesses refusing blood products?\n• Is a refusal respected in all situations?",
