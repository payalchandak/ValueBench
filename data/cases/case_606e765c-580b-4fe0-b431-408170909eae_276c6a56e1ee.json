He has refused antipsy-\nchotic medication in the community and has been sectioned for treatment of his mental\ndisorder under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (MHA).\nDuring his admission he develops pneumonia, requiring intravenous antibiotics, which he\nrefuses, stating he ‘does not want a drip because it might be poisoned’.\nThe team has a dilemma – although they can treat his psychosis without his consent under\nthe MHA, how should they address his refusal of treatment for his pneumonia?\nQuestions\n• In what circumstances can physical problems be treated under the MHA?\n• How does the Mental Capacity Act (MCA) apply to patients under section?",

He is responding to voices telling him to harm himself and believes staff are trying to poison him. After several days he develops fever, hypoxia, and a new chest infiltrate. The medical team recommends intravenous antibiotics because he is vomiting and cannot reliably keep pills down. He pulls at lines and refuses IV access, saying the drip will kill him. He can repeat the facts of “pneumonia” and “antibiotics,” but his refusal is tightly tied to fixed persecutory beliefs. Without prompt treatment he may deteriorate quickly, and sedation or restraints would likely be needed to start therapy and keep the line in place. Hospital counsel and policy confirm that either proceeding with involuntary medical treatment under emergency authority or honoring the refusal while focusing on psychiatric stabilization is legally permissible.",
