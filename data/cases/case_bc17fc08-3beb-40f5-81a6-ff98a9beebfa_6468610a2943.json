Over several visits he calmly and consistently asks to stop dialysis, stating he understands he will likely die within days to weeks without it. He is alert, communicates clearly, and psychiatry finds no delirium or major depression; his family strongly disagrees and urges you to “make him continue.” He is not requesting a lethal medication—only to end ongoing treatment—and he asks for symptom-focused care if he becomes uncomfortable. As the treating physician, you must decide how to respond to his request.",

Two days ago he had a documented episode of delirium during a sepsis evaluation. When briefly more awake, he again says, “Stop dialysis. I’m done—just keep me comfortable.” His spouse, tearful at bedside, says, “This is the medicine talking—he’s not himself.
