      "source_text": "The case of Dr Chabot\nA landmark in this respect has been the so-called Chabot case (Griffiths, 1995). The defendant was a psychiatrist named Boudewyn Chabot, who in September 1991 supplied to Mrs Boomsma, at her request, lethal drugs which she consumed in the presence of the defendant, her GP, and a friend. She died half an hour later.\nMrs Boomsma was 50 years old; she had married at 22, but from the beginning the marriage was unhappy. In 1986 her eldest son committed suicide. From that time on her marital problems grew worse and her husband more violent; her wish to die began to take shape, but she said that she remained alive only to care for her younger son. In 1988 she left her husband, taking her younger son with her. In 1990 her son was admitted to hospital in connection with a traffic accident, and was found to be suffering from cancer, from which he died in May 1991. That same evening Mrs Boomsma attempted suicide with drugs she had put by, but did not die. She then approached the Dutch Association for Voluntary Euthanasia, which put her in touch with Dr Chabot.\nMrs Boomsma was diagnosed as suffering from an adjustment disorder, consisting of a depressed mood, without psychotic signs, in the context of a complicated bereavement process. Although her condition was in principle treatable, treatment would probably have been protracted and the chance of success small. But she rejected therapy, despite Dr Chabot’s best efforts to persuade her. He became convinced that she was experiencing intense, long-term psychic suffering which was unbearable for her, and which held out no prospect of improvement. Her request for assistance with suicide in his opinion was well-considered. In letters and discussion with him, she presented the reasons for her decision clearly and consistently, showing that she understood her situation and the consequences of her decision. In his judgement, her rejection of therapy was also well-considered. Chabot consulted seven experts. None of them believed that there was any realistic chance of success, given Mrs Boomsma’s clear refusal of treatment.",

She lives alone and has cut off most supports. She has no psychosis or mania. She describes her wish to die in clear, consistent terms and demonstrates understanding of alternatives and consequences. She has repeatedly declined medications and psychotherapy, stating that prolonged treatment feels intolerable and unwanted.

You and two independent consultants agree she has decision-making capacity.

She reports persistent anhedonia, guilt, insomnia, and daily thoughts that life is not worth living. Over several visits, she consistently requests assisted dying. She states she refuses further psychiatric treatment, including structured complicated-grief therapy or neuromodulation. She denies suicidal intent outside the assisted-dying pathway and reports no acute plan or preparatory behaviors. Years ago she had a nonfatal overdose after a bereavement. She previously completed several antidepressant trials and supportive therapy, and she stopped them due to side effects and no relief. Two consultants find she can understand, appreciate, reason, and communicate a stable choice. They disagree on whether additional evidence-based treatments offer a meaningful chance of improvement. Assisted dying would end her suffering but is irreversible. Intensive treatment could require hospitalization and exposes her to medication side effects and restrictive monitoring. Hospital counsel confirms either course is legally permissible. The committee meets in two days, and without your recommendation the application closes for months.",
