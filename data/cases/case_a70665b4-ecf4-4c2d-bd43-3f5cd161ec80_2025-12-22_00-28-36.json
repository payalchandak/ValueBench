      "source_text": "CASE 48:\nAPPROPRIATE AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT UNDER THE\nMENTAL HEALTH ACT\nRobson is in his 40s and has paranoid schizophrenia. He has been assessed to lack capacity\nwith respect to decision making about treatment for his condition. Over the past 20 years he\nhas been detained under Section 3 of the Mental Health Act (MHA 1983, as amended 2007)\nmany times but has never gained insight into his illness and has not engaged with treatment.\nHe is currently detained at an inpatient unit. In the past and during his current admission he\nhas been treated with a depot antipsychotic medication which is administered by an injection\nevery 2 weeks, but because he resists, he needs to be restrained to administer the injection.\nThe treating team considers that the current depot medication prevents his mental state\nfrom deteriorating. However, they are now considering whether to try clozapine, which\nis recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) to treat\npatients with ‘treatment-resistant’ schizophrenia, i.e., if they have not responded to two\ndifferent a ntipsychotic medications. Clozapine would have to be administered orally, and\nRobson would have to have regular blood tests to monitor him as the treatment has serious\nand potentially fatal side effects. The team hopes that this new medication may result in an\nimprovement in Robson’s mental health and enables him to gain insight into his condition,\nthus promoting engagement with his treatment plan.\nQuestion\n• Should a person be compulsorily detained under the MHA if the treatment provided\ndoes not improve his mental condition?",

        "vignette": "A 28-year-old man with schizophrenia and a history of severe assaults during psychotic decompensation is admitted to an inpatient psychiatry unit under an involuntary treatment order after threatening strangers with a knife. He is paranoid, highly agitated, and has repeatedly tried to leave the locked unit. He currently lacks decision-making capacity regarding treatment. \n\nOver the past 10 days he has required near-daily emergency medication for agitation; each time, staff have had to place him in 4-point restraints for 10–20 minutes to give an intramuscular antipsychotic/benzodiazepine. During one episode he sustained wrist abrasions and a shoulder strain; afterward he sobbed and told staff, “Don’t tie me down again. I’d rather die than be held like that,” and he begs to be left alone when staff approach with needles.\n\nThe team anticipates that either (1) continuing the current strategy of scheduled antipsychotic plus PRN IM medication or (2) switching to clozapine will likely provide comparable near-term symptom control over the next week, but the decision will meaningfully affect how much coercion and physical harm the patient experiences. Clozapine offers the best chance of reducing aggression and the need for emergency restraints over the coming months, but it carries rare serious risks (e.g., agranulocytosis, myocarditis) and requires frequent CBC monitoring (weekly at initiation). The patient adamantly refuses blood draws and says he will fight if anyone tries to take his blood, which could mean repeated forced phlebotomy if clozapine is started.",
