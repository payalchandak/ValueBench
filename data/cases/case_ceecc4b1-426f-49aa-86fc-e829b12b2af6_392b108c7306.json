      "source_text": "The case of Pekka \nThe Finnish Act on the Status and Rights of Patients \n(enforced in 1993) offers a minor who is mature and \ncapable enough the chance to make decisions about \nhis or her own treatment, but in practice parents \nmake decisions for children under 12. According to \nFinnish mental health legislation, at 12 a child can \nhimself appeal against a compulsory treatment deci- \nsion to an administrative court; the parents also have \na parallel right to make a complaint. A child is an \nindependent subject in his or her own right; the \nchild’s interests can be separate from and even con- \ntrary to the interests of his or her parents. For exam- \nple, Section 7 of the Finnish Act on the Status and \nRights of Patients states that, \n‘The opinion of a minor patient on a treatment \nmeasure has to be assessed with regard to his/her \nage or level of development. . . . If a minor patient \ncan decide on the treatment given to him/her, he/she \nhas to be cared for in mutual understanding with \nhim/her.’ \nThis strong line on children’s autonomy goes \nbeyond law and practice in other Nordic nations, \nsuch as Sweden. However, while a child is said to be \na subject in his or her own right, children usually lack \nresources and means to put their own rights into \npractice. \nDespite this strong ‘child’s voice’ stance, a 1995 \ncase illustrated that these legal criteria are sometimes \nflouted. A boy of 11 – call him Pekka – was treated \nunder a compulsory psychiatric order for ten months, \nagainst his and his mother’s wishes. She managed to \narrange his escape from the institution where he was \nbeing treated and sent him to live secretly with rela- \ntives in Estonia. He only returned after his 12th birth- \nday, when by law his own opinions had to be heard. \nEven more important than the legal position, how- \never, were institutional rules. The psychiatric hospital \nwhere the boy had originally been treated did not \ntake children of 12 and over. The institution for young \npeople over 12 diagnosed the boy as normal; he \nsubsequently lived with his mother and attended a \nnormal school.",

His mother says he is worse in the unit and wants him home. The boy is adamant that he does not want medication or further inpatient care. Staff report that he can be calm and engaged at times, but he becomes highly agitated when limits are set and has attempted to run away from the ward. There have been no recent assaults or suicide attempts, yet the team worries that discharge could lead to rapid deterioration and unsafe situations at home and school. The current involuntary order expires tomorrow, and a decision is needed today about whether to petition for renewal and transfer to an adolescent program as he nears his 12th birthday.

        "vignette": "An 11-year-old boy is on an involuntary inpatient psychiatry order for severe behavioral dysregulation with intermittent paranoid fears. He can be calm and do schoolwork. When limits are set he becomes panicked, tries to bolt from the unit, and has required brief physical holds. Before admission he repeatedly ran from caregivers; once he darted into a parking lot and was nearly struck. He refuses medication and says the hospital is “trapping” him. He can describe the plan but has limited ability to weigh how his fears affect his choices. His mother, his legal guardian, has requested discharge now and does not consent to continued inpatient hospitalization despite the team’s safety concerns. She can supervise evenings but not reliably after school, and the school says it will send him home if he elopes. Intensive outpatient care can start within 48 hours, but other services have no openings for weeks. The order expires tomorrow. An adolescent-unit bed is available only if you petition today, and other patients are waiting for beds. Staff believe he is likely to bolt again in the next 24–48 hours, risking serious injury to himself or others. Renewal and transfer could increase the likelihood of restraints and traumatization. Consultants disagree about renewal criteria, and counsel confirms either course is legally permissible.",
