He had been on that same road just prior to\nthe explosion. He deeply grieved their deaths; subsequently, he spoke with\nan Army psychologist about his “survivor guilt.”\nHe returned to the United States and to his previous job. Ironically,\nwithin six months he was involved in a car accident in which the other driver\nwas killed. Then he developed frequent flashbacks to his war losses,\naffecting his ability to concentrate. While under therapy with a psychiatrist,\nLucille Bell, he heard from a friend that Eye Movement Desensitization and\nReprocessing (EMDR) treatment had been used successfully in such cases.\nHowever, when he sought treatment from Dr. Bell, he learned that his insur-\nance company considered his problem as a “preexisting condition” and\ndenied coverage.",

Over the past month she has presented twice to the emergency department for severe panic and passive suicidal ideation, and her therapist documents escalating self-harm urges when trauma is discussed. \n\nMaya strongly prefers eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and is requesting an out-of-network exception because there is no in-network EMDR provider within 60 miles who can see her within the next 10–12 weeks. She has already completed a full trial of SSRI pharmacotherapy and has tried two covered, in-network trauma-focused therapies (prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy). She stopped both due to worsening dissociation and inability to tolerate the sessions despite appropriate pacing and safety planning; her clinicians document these as failed/intolerable trials rather than nonadherence. Her psychiatrist notes EMDR is an evidence-based, guideline-supported treatment for PTSD and believes delaying effective trauma-focused care increases risk of decompensation, ED visits, and possible hospitalization.\n\nThe requested out-of-network EMDR course is 12 sessions at $250/session. Your plan has a limited exception budget this quarter due to multiple high-cost requests (e.g., urgent out-of-network oncology and pediatric specialty care).
