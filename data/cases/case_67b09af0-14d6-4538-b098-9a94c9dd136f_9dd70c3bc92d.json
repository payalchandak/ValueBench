At medical school you were inter-\nested in the law on advance decisions and you now wish to do a research study to look at the\nprevalence of advance decisions in general practice. You have drafted up a questionnaire\nwhich you want to send out to all general practices in the Clinical Commissioning Group.\nScenario 2\nYou are an FY2 doctor on an intensive care rotation. A patient with multiple sclerosis is\nadmitted to the unit and treated for pneumonia. The patient was adamant that she did not\nwant to receive intravenous antibiotics but no specific reasons were given. The patient’s con-\ndition deteriorated rapidly and she became unconscious. It was considered clinically neces-\nsary to give intravenous antibiotics since they were more likely to be effective against her\nsepsis, and she was no longer able to swallow oral medication. You think that the patient’s\nprior refusal of intravenous antibiotics should be taken into account, and you would like an\nopportunity to discuss the ethical issues.\nQuestions\n• In what circumstances is research ethics approval required?\n• What does a clinical ethics committee do?",
