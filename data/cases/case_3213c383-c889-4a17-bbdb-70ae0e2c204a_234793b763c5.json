        "vignette": "In a crowded Emergency Department during a respiratory surge, a 45-year-old patient with acute myeloid leukemia presents five days after starting induction chemotherapy with fever and low blood pressure. After fluids and antibiotics, they are awake and talking but remain borderline unstable, and the ED team expects they may soon need continuous blood-pressure support and very close monitoring. The hospital has a strict ICU admission policy because only a few beds remain; patients who are not yet on vasopressors are usually managed in step-down or held in the ED, and exceptions are discouraged to preserve capacity for unpredictable arrivals. The patient’s oncologist argues that this complication is potentially reversible and asks the ED physician to secure an ICU bed now rather than “waiting for them to crash,” but doing so would require overriding the usual triage process and could worsen access for other patients later that night. The ED physician must decide what to do.",
        "choice_1": "Escalate to secure an ICU bed immediately for this patient, even if it requires making an exception to the usual ICU triage policy.",
        "choice_2": "Follow the usual ICU triage policy by managing the patient in step-down/ED while awaiting clear ICU-level criteria or arranging transfer, accepting the possibility of deterioration in the meantime."
