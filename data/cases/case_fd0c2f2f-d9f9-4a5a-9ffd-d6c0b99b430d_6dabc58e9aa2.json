He has just finished a 12-hour on-call night\nshift when he decides to go to his local supermarket to pick up some groceries on his way\nhome. Whilst there, he hears someone shout for help. He rushes over to find a body lying\non the floor. It appears that the person has fainted and hit their head on the floor, causing a\nsignificant head wound. James introduces himself as a doctor and applies pressure to the site\nof bleeding to stem blood flow, having checked that the patient was breathing. He asks for an\nambulance to be called. James continues to monitor the patient’s breathing whilst applying\npressure to the head wound. After a short while, an ambulance arrives and the paramedics\ntake over. The supermarket manager takes down James’ details and asks for a description of\nwhat happened.\nThe next day, James arrives at work and recounts the story to a colleague. His colleague\nexpressed his concern at James’ actions, saying that he could get sued. Several days later,\ntwo letters arrive for James in the post. He becomes slightly anxious after hearing what his\ncolleague had said about legal action. He opens the letters; one is from the supermarket\nmanager and the other is from the patient. They both expressed their gratitude for his actions.\nQuestions\n• What is a Good Samaritan act?\n• Is there a legal duty to perform a Good Samaritan act?\n• What standard of care would the doctor be held to in a court of law?\n• Is there an ethical and professional duty to act as a Good Samaritan?",

        "vignette": "A 29-year-old man is brought to a rural emergency department after collapsing in public and striking his head. He is on chronic anticoagulation for a prior DVT, but the agent and last dose are unclear. He is alert and follows commands but is intermittently confused, and staff cannot tell if this is from alcohol, pain, or head injury. He has a deep parietal scalp laceration with an expanding hematoma and persistent bleeding that soaks through packing despite prolonged direct pressure and topical hemostatic gauze. His blood pressure is stable but trending down, and he is becoming restless and pulling at the dressing. The CT scanner is down for at least two hours, and weather delays transfer to a trauma center. The on-call surgeon and neurosurgeon are available by phone but cannot arrive tonight. Immediate bedside exploration and closure could control hemorrhage but could also obscure a skull fracture or evolving intracranial hemorrhage and may worsen bleeding in an anticoagulated patient without reversal or surgical backup. Continued packing may avoid provoking deeper bleeding but risks ongoing blood loss with worsening hypotension and possible need for transfusion before imaging is available. Hospital policy permits either urgent bedside hemostasis by the ED physician or temporizing measures with close monitoring while awaiting imaging. You must decide now whether to explore and close the wound before CT.",
