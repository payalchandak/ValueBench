      "source_text": "The case of Mr R\nMr R was born with a serious malformation of the brain and cerebral palsy. At eight months of age he developed severe epilepsy. At the age of 23 he had spastic diplegia (paralysis) and was incontinent, as well as apparently deaf and blind (with possible vestigial response to a buzzer and to light). He was unable to walk, to sit upright or to chew; so that food had to be syringed to the back of his mouth. His bowels had to be evacuated manually because his limited diet resulted in serious constipation. He suffered from thrush and had ulcers all the way through his guts, according to testimony. When cuddled he did indicate pleasure, and he also appeared to respond to pain by grimacing. Although he was not comatose, nor in a persistent vegetative state, his awareness on a scale of 1 to 10 was rated somewhere between 1 and 2 in an assessment by Dr Keith Andrews of the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability at Putney, London, who said:\nIt is my opinion that he has very little, if any, real cognitive awareness at a level where he can interpret what is going on in his environment. He reacts at the most basic level by responding to comfort, warmth and a safe environment by being relaxed and producing the occasional smile. He responds to discomfort, pain and threatening situations by becoming distressed and crying. These are very basic level responses and do not imply any thought processes.\nUntil he was 17 Mr R lived at home, where he was totally dependent on his devoted parents. He then moved to a residential home, but continued to return home at weekends. Now his condition was beginning to deteriorate: his weight had dropped to just over 30 kg, and he was extremely frail, suffering from recurrent chest infections, bleeding from ulceration of the oesophagus, and continued epileptic fits. In 1995 he was admitted to hospital on five occasions, each time for a life-threatening crisis.\nAfter the last crisis Dr S, the consultant psychiatrist for learning difficulties who was responsible for his care, wrote:\nTo hospitalize Mr R if he had another life-threatening crisis would, in my clinical judgement, be nothing more than striving officiously to keep him alive for no gain to him. In my opinion, this is tantamount to a failing against a basic duty of humanity. Indeed, at the last few admissions to hospital, I have had real concern as to whether it was ethical to treat him actively. That said, I would never withhold treatment against the wishes of his parents. In summary, taking R’s best interests into account and whilst taking into account the basic premise of the sanctity of human life, it is in my judgement unquestionably in R’s best interests to allow nature to take its course next time he has a life-threatening crisis and to allow him to die with some comfort and dignity. That would relieve him of physical, mental and emotional suffering.\nNow please continue with your reading of the case.\nThe immediate question now was whether to resuscitate Mr R in the event of another acute admission resulting in cardiac arrest. He was so frail that it was feared CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) might crush his ribcage. In addition, there was a risk of further brain damage from resuscitation. A subsidiary question was whether to administer antibiotics if he developed pneumonia. After Mr R’s fifth hospital admission, in September 1995, the consultant, Dr S, discussed the position with Mr R’s parents. They agreed that Mr R would not be subjected to CPR if he suffered a cardiac arrest in future. Accordingly, Dr S signed a DNR (do not resuscitate) direction, signed by Mr R’s mother under the heading ‘next of kin’. This decision was opposed by staff at the day care centre which Mr R had been attending; they felt that he did in fact have some ‘quality of life’. In addition they interpreted Dr S’s decision as a ‘no treatment’ policy, which Dr S denied: the only treatment which she was withholding, she argued, was cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Agreement could not be reached, and a member of the day care centre staff applied for review of the decision by a court, on the basis of information provided by social workers involved in Mr R’s day care.\nThe basis of the application was that the DNR decision was irrational and unlawful in permitting medical treatment to be withheld on the basis of an assessment of the patient’s quality of life. The hospital sought a court judgement that, despite Mr R’s inability to give a valid refusal of treatment, it would be lawful and in his best interests to withhold cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and the administration of antibiotics. However, a proposed gastrostomy would be performed, underlining that there was no question of a comprehensive refusal to treat Mr R. Likewise, the hospital decided that it would ventilate Mr R and provide artificial nutrition and hydration if applicable, although initially it had indicated it would not. The application made it clear that the hospital intended to furnish such treatment and nursing care as may from time to time be appropriate to ensure that [R] suffers the least distress and retains the greatest dignity until such time as his life comes to an end.\nIn the High Court hearing, where Mr R was represented by the Official Solicitor (who acts on behalf of incompetent patients), discussion centred on guidelines for resuscitation issued by the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1993 in a joint statement with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). It has been argued that resuscitation, originally devised to be used in a small minority of cases, is sometimes over-used (Hilberman et al., 1997). Although the technique can be very successful in the right context, in some US states it has become the default response to cardiac arrest, that is, it is required unless it is explicitly refused or clearly ‘futile’. Yet cardiac arrest is part of death. But was Mr R dying?\nIt is also wrong to think that CPR necessarily will work for every patient. Because it might not do so, we nowadays prefer to talk of DNAR orders; in instructing ‘do not attempt resuscitation’, we make it clearer to patients, their families and even the healthcare professionals that CPR can sometimes be tried, but there is no guarantee that it will revive every patient (British Medical Association et al., 2007).\nThe 1993 BMA/RCN guidelines, as used in relation to Mr R, did not actually say that resuscitation must always be attempted unless the patient is clearly in a terminal condition. Instead, they suggested three types of case in which it is appropriate to consider a DN(A)R decision:\n(a) Where the patient’s condition indicates that effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unlikely to be successful\n(b) Where CPR is not in accord with the recorded sustained wishes of the patient who is mentally competent\n(c) Where successful CPR is likely to be followed by a length and quality of life which would not be acceptable to the patient.\nCondition (a) is the most obviously clinical of the three. It seems to focus solely on the medical facts of the matter. Certainly Mr R is gravely ill, but he has come through five acute admissions in the past year, so it is difficult to say that he is definitely unlikely to survive CPR. Condition (b) cannot be met, because Mr R is not mentally competent to record a wish. Finally, we have condition (c), focusing on unacceptable quality of life – but again, the guidance talks of this being acceptable or unacceptable to the patient. It is very hard to know whether Mr R gets any enjoyment out of life: he seems to respond to being cuddled, and to react to pain, but that is really all we can say. The BMA guidelines did note that ‘If the patient cannot express a view, the opinion of others close to the patient may be sought regarding the patient’s best interests.’ But, although the situation is nowadays different in England, the 1993 guidelines do not say that opinion has anything more than advisory value as to what the patient would regard as reasonable quality of life. (We will consider the views of his family again in a moment.) The guidelines also appear to envision a different kind of situation – where a previously competent patient, who (unlike Mr R) had expressed definite views about good and bad quality of life, is no longer able to enunciate his or her wishes, but where the family will remember his or her preferences.\nSo, strictly speaking, it is possible to make a case for arguing that none of these conditions applies to Mr R. But that was not the opinion of the court. Prompted by guidance from Keith Andrews as an expert witness, the court agreed that conditions (b) and (c) were not applicable – ruling out the quality of life arguments both for and against. Only condition (a) was to be considered, that is, the likelihood rather than the desirability of successful CPR. Even in hospital settings only about 13% of patients receiving CPR survive to discharge, Dr Andrews testified; in a residential home such as the one Mr R lived in, the chances would be ‘virtually nil’. Accordingly, the case turned on the alleged futility of treatment, rather than on the quality of Mr R’s life. On the basis of medical futility, the Court accepted the DNAR order, but not a global policy against other interventions by the consultant when and if a potentially life-threatening infection arose.",

CPR could also cause major injury and lead to intubation and a prolonged ICU course with uncertain comfort control given his limited communication. The residential home will only accept either Full Code or DNAR, and the hospital does not allow partial-code orders. State law and hospital policy allow either order, and you must enter one before discharge because the parents are leaving tonight and ethics consultation is unavailable until after transfer.",
