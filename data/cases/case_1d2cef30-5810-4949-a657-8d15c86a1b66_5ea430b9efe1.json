Despite a portable DNAR (do-not-attempt-\nresuscitation) form signed by his daughter, who was his legally authorized\ndecision-maker, Mr. Bumgartner received cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nin the emergency room. He was then admitted to the intensive care unit. The\nprimary care physician and consultant neurologist authorized extubation\nand removal of the respirator but then declined to insist on this because\nDennis Havens, the consultant pulmonologist, insisted that Mr. Bumgartner\nwas not “brain dead.” Without any change in his condition, Mr. Bumgartner\ndied three days later.\nHorton Pickering was the case reviewer for the insurance company,\nwhich was part of an HMO system. He refused to pay the costs for the three\ndays of “extended care” because of the valid DNAR on the chart. Mr. Pickering\nclaimed that the patient should not have been admitted to intensive care\nand that overuse of facilities and services were not the responsibility of\nthe HMO.",

        "vignette": "An 82-year-old man with a witnessed massive intracerebral hemorrhage arrives at the emergency department in a coma. His daughter, who holds durable power of attorney for healthcare, presents a signed and witnessed portable do-not-resuscitate order. Despite this, the emergency team intubated and resuscitated the patient during initial stabilization. He was then admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation. The consulting neurologist confirms a devastating prognosis with no meaningful chance of recovery, though the patient does not meet formal brain death criteria. The daughter reaffirms her father's prior wishes to avoid aggressive life-sustaining treatment and requests withdrawal of support. The patient remains comatose and stable on the ventilator. As the insurance medical director reviewing this case in real time, you must decide whether to authorize continued ICU-level reimbursement. Authorizing payment ensures the clinical team can continue current management without external pressure, allowing them to navigate family discussions and end-of-life decisions according to their usual standards of care. Denying coverage would enforce the documented advance directive by creating financial and administrative pressure to withdraw treatment the patient explicitly refused, but it imposes institutional consequences on a case where resuscitation has already occurred.",
