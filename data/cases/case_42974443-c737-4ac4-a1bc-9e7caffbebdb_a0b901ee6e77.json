Pamela is scheduled to have surgery today\nfor removal of the fibroids, and the consultant asks the student if she would like to scrub in\nto assist during the operation. The student has assisted the anaesthetist before the operation\nand has reassured Pamela about the planned operation. Once Pamela is anaesthetised, the\nconsultant asks the student to demonstrate how she would perform an internal examination\non a female patient. The student realises that Pamela was not asked for permission to do this\nand feels that it would be wrong to carry out the examination. However, she also thinks that\nit would be a good learning opportunity and she is slightly in awe of the consultant and she\nknows that he has shouted at other students. The student decides to point out that she does\nnot have Pamela’s consent, but the consultant reassures her that as Pamela is anaesthetised\nshe will not know anything about it.\nQuestions\n• Should the student perform an internal examination on Pamela?\n• What should she say to her consultant if she refuses?",

After induction, the surgeon realizes that a bimanual exam could clarify uterine position and cervical angle, which may help avoid traction injuries and guide safe instrument placement. The anesthesiologist says waking her now would be feasible, but it would mean a second induction and may require postponing the case. Proceeding without the exam is also feasible, but it means relying on imaging and limited tactile information.

After induction and cervical instrumentation for planned uterine manipulation, the surgeon cannot confidently orient the uterus. Proceeding without better orientation may increase the risk of uterine perforation, hemorrhage, or ureteral injury. A brief bimanual exam would likely improve anatomic orientation and reduce these risks, but it may not change the operative plan. Waking her now would require stopping and rescheduling. Her bleeding and anemia may worsen while she waits, with possible emergency visits, transfusion, or loss of a fertility-sparing window. Lightening anesthesia to ask is unsafe, no intraoperative ultrasound is available, and she listed no surrogate and requested no family contact. The OR is behind schedule and another urgent case is waiting for the room. The surgeon must decide now.",
