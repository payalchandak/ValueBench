      "source_text": "Case 10-7\nBiased Counseling: Teaching about Birth Control\nStanislaw Pokowski was in a four-person group practice in internal medi-\ncine. He had immigrated from Poland in 1990 soon after Poland's political\nchanges. He had routinely explained to his female patients that he was\nmorally opposed to abortion and would not counsel patients on the subject.\nSince others in his practice were willing to take such patients, this arrange-\nment had never caused problems.\nDr. Pokowski was increasingly troubled by a related moral problem.\nHe was regularly asked by his patients for prescriptions for contraception.\nHe had provided prescriptions for them but was troubled by such requests\nfrom unmarried patients, especially from young women. He decided he\nwould not ask that these patients transfer to a colleague in the practice, but\nwould rather continue providing care for them. He would counsel them\nabout the pharmacological effects of the pill.\nHis practice was to describe minor side effects first: light bleeding,\nskipped periods, nausea, weight change, bloating, increase in vaginal in-\nfections. He also mentioned a darkening of the skin on the face, which, he\nnoted, may be permanent.\nHe then turned to cardiac problems, noting the association of the pill\nwith blood clots, heart attacks, and blood pressure increases and strokes\nas well as effects of worsening migraines, gall bladder disease, and\nchanges in blood levels of fatty acids.\nOn the subject of cancer he said that questions remain about the as-\nsociation of the pill with cancer and there was some evidence of associa-\ntion with liver cancer. He also said he was not convinced of an association\nbetween the pill and cervical cancer, but some studies have shown an\nincreased risk of breast cancer.\nDr. Pokowski also opened conversation with his younger patients\nabout the problems of bearing children while young and unmarried. He\npointed out the enormous economic responsibility involved in having chil-\ndren and went on to connect this discussion with the fact that even with the\nbest birth control pills pregnancies result. He also urged the patient to talk\nwith her priest or minister about the issues of using chemicals that were\nnot a natural way of limiting births.\nIf his patients insisted on a prescription for the pill, he would then\nwrite it.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nIs Dr. Pokowski providing the truth to his patients about oral contraceptives or\nnot?\nWhat should he tell his patients about oral contraceptives?\nHow does the principle of justice enter into Dr. Pokowski’s decision on how to\ncounsel patients?",

You routinely disclose that you hold strong personal beliefs about sex outside marriage and prefer not to be involved in decisions you think encourage it.

She wants to start immediately and keep it private from family who see her insurance mail and online portal. Her blood pressure is normal and she does not smoke. She reports no migraine with aura, clotting history, or interacting medications. Her last period was about six weeks ago and she had unprotected sex within the past week. You offer a urine pregnancy test and emergency contraception, but she declines testing because she fears documentation will reach her family. Starting combined pills today without confirming pregnancy could delay recognition of an early pregnancy. You have a longstanding conscientious policy of not prescribing contraception and you have been open about it with patients. Clinic policy allows you either to prescribe or to activate an expedited referral pathway, but not to provide a bridge prescription. A nearby family planning clinic can see her today without using insurance, but it requires travel across town and out-of-pocket payment. She leaves tomorrow, and if she cannot reach the clinic today she may go without contraception and emergency contraception. Hospital leadership confirms either course is legally permissible.",
