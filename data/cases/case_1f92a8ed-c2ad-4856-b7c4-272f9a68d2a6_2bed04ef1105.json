      "source_text": "Case 11-3\nSickle Cell and Black Genocide\nWilbur Johnson and Mae Sanford, both African American, had met while\nworking on a community action project in a large Eastern city. After going\ntogether for a year, they decided to get married and have a family.\nMr. Johnson's physician, Lester Kettering, asked if Mr. Johnson knew\nhis sickle cell status and explained that if both he and his future wife were\ncarriers, they had one chance in four that any child born to them would\nhave the disease. He further explained that they would also have two\nchances in four that a child would be a carrier, while in one of four births\nthe offspring would carry no copies of the gene. Dr. Kettering also explained\nthat it was state law that any children born would be routinely tested for\nsickle cell status, unless the parents registered their objection.\nThe disease itself is an inherited abnormality in the structure of hemo-\nglobin, which at a minimum almost always severely handicaps its victims.\nLife expectancy now, as a result of better treatment, has increased, but aver-\nage age of death is still in the forties. Sickle cell disease is autosomal reces-\nsive; that is, both parents must have at least one copy of the gene before\nthere is a risk of producing children with the disease (homozygotes). When\nboth parents are carriers, the risk of bearing such a child is 25 percent with\neach pregnancy. Carriers themselves are almost symptomless and may\nhave no idea of their status unless they are screened.\nMr. Johnson's younger brother died in adolescence from the disease,\nafter many painful and debilitating attacks. He thus knew something about\nit, including the fact that there was a good possibility that he himself was a\ncarrier. Mr. Johnson also knew that the trait is fairly common among African\nAmericans, about one in twelve of them being a carrier, so that there was a\ngood chance his fiancée was a carrier too. Ms. Sanford knows of no sickle\ncell disease in her immediate family, but she is in a racial group with a rela-\ntively high rate of carriers.\nMr. Johnson understands that, if both he and his future wife are carri-\ners, they will face additional choices. Prenatal diagnosis is now available\nthat will accurately determine if a fetus has sickle cell disease. The only\nintervention other than counseling available at that point, however, is the\ntermination of the pregnancy. Their other option would be to continue\nthe pregnancy until delivery, at which time routine testing will determine\nthe sickle cell status. If the infant has the disease (i.e., two copies of the\ngene), treatment regimens are now considered sufficiently effective that\nidentification of infants with the disease is mandated. For example, infec-\ntions need to be suppressed using antibiotics.\nThus, two prospective parents who know they both are carriers have\nfour options: they can risk a 25 percent chance of having a child with the\ndisease itself with each pregnancy, living with the attendant anxiety; they\ncan undergo prenatal diagnosis and abort affected fetuses; they can resort\nto artificial insemination with a noncarrier donor; or they can forgo child-\nbearing altogether, perhaps adopting if the short supply of adoptable\nbabies permits.\nMr. Johnson found each of these alternatives infuriatingly unaccept-\nable. He feared that the offer of premarital screening of African American\nfor the sickle cell trait, which is not a clinical condition and about which\nnothing can be done, was just another government attempt to cripple black\nreproductive capability. In the context of black history, he viewed it as an\nattempt by white society to control his fecundity in the beneficent guise of\nproviding medical options. All of their options seemed to inhibit childbear-\ning either because they would limit births (abortion and forgoing children\naltogether) or because they were expensive (prenatal testing or artificial\ninsemination). The choices were all unattractive and would inhibit his and\nhis wife's normal family development. Since the information would pro-\nduce anxiety and would inhibit childbearing, he came to doubt that screen-\ning for carrier status was defensible. He was also annoyed that while the\nstate rushed in to mandate screening of newborns—screening that might\nsuggest that African Americans should have no children—it paid little at-\ntention to the need for counseling connected with screening that would\nhelp those identified as having a sickle cell trait to understand their situa-\ntion and the alternatives for having children. He was more disturbed that,\nwhile the state mandated testing, it did not mandate health insurance that\nwould be necessary to cover the costs of intervention if their child turned\nout to have sickle cell.\nMs. Sanford did not feel so strongly, but she agreed that there was a\ndanger whenever the state mandated screening for a disease that primar-\nily affected African American families.",

        "vignette": "A 27-year-old Black woman delivers her first child after an uncomplicated labor. The newborn is well. Both parents report sickle cell disease in close relatives and think they may carry the trait. They refuse the routine newborn blood spot screen for sickle cell status. They report prior involvement of child protective services and past discriminatory experiences. They fear that genetic results in the electronic record can trigger added CPS scrutiny or insurance or employment discrimination, which they believe disproportionately affects Black families. They accept standard exams and vaccines. You explain that many infants with sickle cell disease look well at birth. You note that the screen can be indeterminate and still needs confirmatory testing, but early knowledge can speed counseling, infection-prevention planning, and hematology follow-up. You also note that the state newborn screening program is designed to ensure all infants, especially those at higher risk, have equal access to early sickle cell interventions. The lab cannot hold or de-identify specimens, and results auto-populate the chart. The family plans to leave within hours to a remote area and will not return for outpatient testing soon. Hospital policy and state rules permit either honoring documented refusal or ordering the test over objection after rapid ethics review. Specimens must be sent before the next pickup.",
