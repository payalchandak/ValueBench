She says the pregnancy feels intolerable and she is afraid she will harm herself emotionally if forced to continue, but she does not describe an immediate suicide plan. She understands the fetus may be able to survive with intensive neonatal care if delivered now. She also understands that ending a pregnancy at this gestational age would require a multi-day process at a tertiary center and could cause heavy bleeding, infection, or future fertility complications. If you decline, she will likely continue the pregnancy and can pursue adoption, but she says she will not engage in prenatal care if she feels unheard.

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old woman at 28 weeks’ gestation requests pregnancy termination. Dating is confirmed and no fetal anomaly has been identified. She reports escalating depression and panic tied to the pregnancy and says she cannot tolerate continuing. She denies current suicidal intent, plan, or preparatory behaviors. Psychiatry evaluated her twice this week and finds capacity intact and no criteria for involuntary admission, but warns she may rapidly decompensate with increased self-harm risk if the pregnancy continues. Intensive outpatient or inpatient perinatal programs are not available locally within the next week, and she refuses voluntary hospitalization. The specialty center that performs later-gestation terminations will only schedule her within 72 hours if you send records and attest that the pregnancy poses a serious threat to her mental health. The policy language is vague and consultants disagree on whether she meets it. The center has limited late-termination slots, so overstating risk could displace patients with clearer indications, while declining to attest may disproportionately burden patients without local perinatal services. Termination would intentionally end a potentially viable fetus, often with fetal demise induced before a multi-day procedure, and some staff may object. Hospital counsel has confirmed either course is legally permissible here.",
