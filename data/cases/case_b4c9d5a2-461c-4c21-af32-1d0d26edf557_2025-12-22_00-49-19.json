      "source_text": "Case 12-1\nGuilt over Suicidal Thoughts\nLilly Wong was a 44-year-old married woman of Chinese American heri-\ntage. She had been seeing psychiatrist Gilbert DeVita now for a month,\nattempting to resolve intense feelings of guilt related to her persistent sui-\ncidal thoughts. She acknowledged to Dr. DeVita that for the past two years\nshe had had thoughts of ending her life. She had developed deep feelings\nthat included her more and more firm resolve to commit suicide, but si-\nmultaneously felt very guilty that she would be abandoning her respon-\nsibilities to her family and her community were she to do so.\nDr. DeVita had learned over the course of the four sessions he had\nhad with her that she was married to a Caucasian American with a history\nof alcoholism and abuse of his wife. Most of the abuse was mental. He criti-\ncized her constantly, complaining about the way she kept house and prepared\nmeals. Dr. DeVita had gotten her to reveal that, on at least two occasions,\nhe had struck her; once, a year ago, it had resulted in a trip to the hospital\nemergency room. That was the most recent physical attack that Dr. DeVita\nwas able to elicit from Ms. Wong.\nOver the years Ms. Wong had studied the history of Chinese thought\nand the culture of her parents who had immigrated from China when\nMs. Wong was a child. This Chinese cultural history, with its Confucian\ninfluences, was the closest thing Ms. Wong had to a religion. From it she\nhad come to understand that those in her heritage had sometimes chosen\nsuicide as a way to end a difficult life situation. She had decided that\nher marriage was hopeless and that ending her life was her way out. At\nthe same time, from her American culture she had absorbed the idea that\nsuicide was immoral and was in her words, “running away from the\nproblem.”\nDr. DeVita sympathized with Ms. Wong's plight, but had real doubts\nabout the wisdom of her chosen course. He was in a difficult position if\nshe was asking him to help her overcome her guilt in order to free herself\nfrom the constraints that would help her pursue the course she had chosen.\nAt the same time, he was not sure what his role should be. He knew that\nspousal abuse could be reported, but Ms. Wong pleaded that he not dis-\nclose those problems. The physical aspects of the abuse had ceased, at\nleast for the time being, and the mental cruelty was, in her view, not some-\nthing she wanted to address. Dr. DeVita offered to begin a course of therapy\nto overcome what he took to be a depression related to her feeling of hope-\nlessness in her marriage. She asked some questions, as if she were inter-\nested in that approach, but then quickly said that that was not what she\nwanted.",
