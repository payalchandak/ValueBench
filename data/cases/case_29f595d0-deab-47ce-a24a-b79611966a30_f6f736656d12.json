      "source_text": "CASE 31:\nCONSENT AND EMERGENCIES\nYou are a Year 5 specialist trainee (ST5) in obstetrics. You have been asked to review a patient\nby her midwife. The woman is a 30-year-old Polish lady in labour named Greta. This is her\nfirst pregnancy and she is full term. The midwife has established that her husband is on his\nway in. Her grasp of English is limited. She is in a lot of pain and not engaging with her\nmidwife. The trace of her baby’s heart is classified as pathological. Her liquor is stained with\nmeconium. The clinical picture indicates that the baby is in distress and needs delivering\nimmediately by a caesarean section to prevent intrauterine death.\nQuestions\n• What clinical problems can impact on gaining adequate consent to treatment?\n• What could you do if Greta refuses to consent to an emergency caesarean section?",
