      "source_text": "The case of Danny\nTen-year-old Danny has neurofibromatosis, which required removal of a major fibroma in his left tibia when he was only two. (His mother had previously died of the disease.) Bone was taken from his right fibula in an attempt to strengthen the left tibia, but after 15 months in plaster, his lower left leg had to be amputated. His right leg was weakened by the surgery, and he then underwent two attempts at osteostomy to treat a valgus right foot (one that rolls over). Now he is undergoing limb lengthening of the right fibula. As he describes it, ‘I’m going to have a bone graft in my right leg. Take a little bit from here (he touches his hip) and put it here (he touches his ankle) to fix it. And get a pin, just put it in and stitch it, then they wait till they heal it.’ He smiles and jokes about the forthcoming procedure: ‘Then I’ll get a wheelchair – be lazy all the time, I like that, better than crutches.’\nDanny’s parents are less sanguine: they have just learned that another large tumour has to be removed from his left leg stump. They feel that they have little choice but to consent to a further amputation if that proves necessary during the additional surgery, which will be done at the same time as the limb lengthening. They have not told Danny that his entire leg may have to be amputated. He knows about the new tumour, and has said ‘I don’t mind them taking the tumour, but I don’t want them taking any more of my leg away’. Danny’s father says, ‘You feel that everyone is doing what they believe to be in his best interest, but they are tending to work a little bit blind’.\nACTIVITY: Stop at this point in the story and complete your checklist in relation to the limb lengthening of Danny’s right fibula and possible left leg amputation. Has a meaningful consent been obtained? Has the child’s voice been heard? What about the parents’ position?\nIn the event it proved possible to save the remaining left leg, and the right leg grew well, although Danny suffered a great deal of pain from the limb lengthening procedure. Now the surgeons want to lengthen the small stump below Danny’s left knee. Danny’s stepmother explained to the boy that this will give greater leverage to the prosthesis, but Danny said adamantly, ‘I don’t want them doing that!’. He would not explain why; he looked tired and depressed now, with dark circles under his eyes and little of his former chirpy manner. The surgeon gave the family three months to think about it, though he hinted that ‘It would be interesting to see how the leg responds’. Danny’s stepmother was sceptical about the surgeon’s motive: ‘Is he really thinking about what’s for Danny’s benefit, or is he just curious?’ Danny’s father replied, ‘He genuinely felt that there was some advantage to Danny’. But Danny’s stepmother argued, ‘He’s going to senior school soon, he doesn’t want another six months in a wheelchair’.\nIn the end, the family refused consent for lengthening the left leg stump.",

A new operation is offered to lengthen the short left stump to improve leverage for his prosthesis as he grows. It would require another course of external fixation, frequent adjustments, and a long period in a wheelchair, with uncertain emotional toll after his last experience. The boy says he wants no more procedures on the stump and becomes withdrawn when asked to explain. His father thinks the added length could help him walk more independently long-term, while his stepmother worries about another painful, isolating recovery as he starts a new school year. Hospital policy and state law support either proceeding with parental consent or deferring given his sustained objection.
