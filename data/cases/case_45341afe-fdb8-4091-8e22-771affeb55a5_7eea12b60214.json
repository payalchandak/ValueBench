      "source_text": "Case 7-5\nA Clash of Cultures: A Japanese Family Asks That Their Father\nNot Be Told of Cancer\nThe surgeon, Dr. Phyllis Rollins, had just examined the patient after refer-\nral from an internist. Dr. Rollins was part of a large oncology practice in a\nlarge, West Coast American city. Mr. Nikki previously had endoscopy and\nbiopsy of the stomach confirming a very large cancer. Since Mr. Nikki spoke\nlittle English, his son came into the room to help. The patient's wife took the\npatient into another room beyond hearing distance. Then the surgeon fully\nexplained the nature of the malignancy, that an operation was clearly indi-\ncated, and that the father must be given that information, including the\nprocess of preparation, the prognosis, the risks, probable outcomes, and\nother details so that truly informed consent may be obtained.\nAbruptly, the son replied that if his father were told the diagnosis, “he\nwill wither up and die.” Dr. Rollins replied that she could not proceed with\nsurgical care of Mr. Nikki without his understanding of and agreement toa\nmajor operation. “You just don’t understand ‘the Japanese way’—in Japan,\nthe word ‘cancer’ cannot be mentioned to the person who is ill,” said the\nson. He proposed that Dr. Rollins tell Mr. Nikki nothing and prepare for\nsurgical treatment secretly. Dr. Rollins withdrew from the case, providing\nsome other surgeons’ names to the family. Later, she learned that the pa-\ntient had been operated upon at another hospital, presumably without\nbeing told of his diagnosis.",

Endoscopic biopsy shows a large gastric adenocarcinoma that appears surgically resectable but is causing near-obstruction. He speaks little English.

He asks you to describe it as a “growth” and proceed with gastrectomy tomorrow. When you speak with the patient through his son, the patient smiles, avoids questions, and says he wants whatever his family thinks is best. A trained medical interpreter is available now.
