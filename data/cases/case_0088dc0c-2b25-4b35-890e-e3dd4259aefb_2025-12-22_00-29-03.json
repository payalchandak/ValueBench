PT documents he requires a walker and close guarding; nursing notes he frequently forgets to use the call light. The team plans discharge tomorrow because his medical workup is complete, but he lives alone in a two-story apartment with loose rugs and no nearby family.\n\nThe hospital’s inpatient occupational therapy (OT) service has only two “urgent home-safety evaluation” slots per day reserved by policy for patients with a *recent injurious fall* (fracture/head injury), or those with *imminent discharge* who cannot safely leave without OT equipment/home-safety planning. Due to staffing shortages, routine OT consults are running 7–10 days behind.\n\nA competing patient on the unit, an 84-year-old woman who fractured her wrist in a fall last week and is being discharged today to live with her daughter, needs an urgent OT visit to assess stair navigation, bathroom setup, and adaptive equipment. If her OT assessment is delayed, she will likely be discharged without needed equipment and has a high risk of another fall and loss of independence.\n\nThis patient’s case meets the urgent-OT criteria only marginally: his falls were not injurious, and his discharge could be delayed a day or two for outpatient/home-health OT. However, his anticoagulation substantially increases the risk of catastrophic intracranial hemorrhage if he falls again. Interim mitigations (24-hour supervision, short-term rehab placement, or delaying anticoagulation) are not feasible: he refuses a rehab facility, has no family to stay with him, and cardiology recommends continuing apixaban given his stroke risk.
