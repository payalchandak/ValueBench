Since then, staff have kept her indoors, and she has become restless and tearful, insisting she “needs to go for a walk” and trying to exit whenever doors open. Her daughter, who is her health care proxy, says her mother always valued independence and asks that she not be “locked up,” but also fears a fatal injury.
