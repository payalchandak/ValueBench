        "vignette": "A 42-year-old man with a history of depression presents to the emergency department after ingesting a large quantity of acetaminophen approximately 90 minutes ago in what he describes as an impulsive act during an argument with his partner. He is now calm, fully alert and oriented, and adamantly states he regrets the ingestion and wants to go home. He refuses activated charcoal and refuses blood work, saying he feels fine and doesn't want any treatment. He denies ongoing suicidal ideation and insists this was an isolated impulsive moment that he will not repeat. The treating physician knows that without treatment, he faces a substantial risk of severe liver injury or death over the coming days, even though he currently has no symptoms. The patient has decision-making capacity and understands the risks but remains firm in his refusal. The physician must decide whether to accept his refusal or pursue emergency detention to administer life-saving treatment against his will.",
