      "source_text": "CASE 42:\nPROVISION OF INFORMATION\nRachel was very excited to be pregnant with her first child but was not having an easy\npregnancy. She is naturally petite and had developed gestational diabetes, which was not\ndetected until 30 weeks into her pregnancy. She was then referred to a specialist obstetrician\nas her pregnancy was considered high risk.\nAs Rachel had been diagnosed with gestational diabetes she was more likely to have a larger\nbaby. In her case this was particularly worrisome due to her small frame. She was consid-\nered at significant risk of the baby developing shoulder dystocia (the shoulder getting stuck)\nduring delivery. This is a major obstetric emergency associated with short- and long-term\nneonatal and maternal morbidity and associated neonatal mortality.\nAlthough Rachel was told that she was having a larger-than-usual baby, she was not told\nabout the risks of her experiencing mechanical problems during labour and she was not told\nabout the risk of shoulder dystocia. Rachel had repeatedly expressed concerns about the size\nof the foetus and about the risk that the baby might be too big to be delivered vaginally but\nshe had not asked her consultant specifically about this risk.\nDuring the birth the baby did develop shoulder dystocia. There was a 15-minute delay\nbetween the baby’s head appearing and the delivery, and during this time the baby was\ndeprived of oxygen. At a few months old, her son was diagnosed as suffering from severe\ncerebral palsy, caused by deprivation of oxygen. If Rachel had been given the option of having\nan elective caesarean section her son would have been born uninjured.\nQuestions\n• What information should be discussed with patients prior to consent for a\nproce dure?\n• What if a patient does not ask questions about risks?\n• Can a doctor not disclose information about risks if he thinks that information will\nbe harmful to the patient?",
