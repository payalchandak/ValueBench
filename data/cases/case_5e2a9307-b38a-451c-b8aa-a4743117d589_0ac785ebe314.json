      "source_text": "The case of Mr AB\nMr AB was a 90-year-old man who su ered from\ndementia. After several years of being cared for at\nhome by his wife, Mr AB was nally admitted to a\nspecial care unit in northern Italy because his wife no\nlonger felt able to bear the demands which caring for\nher husband placed upon her.\nOn admission to the unit, a clinical and multidimen-\n’\nsional evaluation of Mr AB s condition revealed him to\nbe severely cognitively impaired and to be extremely\nfrail as a result of malnutrition. Mr AB was capable to\nsome limited extent of walking and also of eating but\nwas dependent upon others in virtually every other\nrespect. Although he was able to walk, Mr AB found\nffi\nbalance very di cult and needed the support of a\ncarer. The doctors who saw him also recorded that he\n‘ ’\nhad severe behaviour disorders associated with\n’\ndementia, such as anxiety and agitation.\nThe physician responsible for Mr AB s care\nfl ’\ndesigned a walking rehabilitation programme for\nhim and the nurses in the unit tried to improve his\nfi nutritional status by means of personal care and\nattention during meal times and by the use of nutri-\ntional supplements. It was also decided to reduce the\nlevels of psychotropic drugs with which Mr AB had\nbeen treated while he was living at home.\nAfter 20 days of treatment at the special care unit,\n’\nMr AB s cognitive and functional status had improved\ndramatically and he was now able to walk alone,\n‘ ’\nwithout help. His behaviour disorders were also less\nsevere and disturbing (especially his anxiety and\nagitation) despite the fact that his treatment with\npsychotropic drugs had been reduced.\nAfter 35 days at the unit, however, Mr AB devel-\noped a fever and cough which became progressively\nworse. This was diagnosed as pneumonia. As a result\nof the pneumonia, Mr AB became much more con-\nfused again and was no longer able to walk. He also\nlost the ability to feed himself. All this resulted in a\n’\ndramatic and serious decline in Mr AB s health. It was\n’\nfelt that Mr AB s life would be at risk unless his pneu-\nmonia was treated and he received some nutrition.\n’\nAfter discussing the patient s condition with\nhis wife, the physician started treating Mr AB intra-\nfl\nvenously with uids and also with antibiotics.\nHowever, during attempts to administer intravenous\ndrugs Mr AB became very irritable and agitated. He\nalso refused food during assisted meals.\nAfter further consultation with Mr AB s wife, short-\n’\nterm physical restraints were adopted by the hospital\nsta , both during the administration of drugs and\nff\nduring assisted meals. After 2 weeks Mr AB recovered\nfrom pneumonia and returned to his previous daily\nnourishment and drug therapy.",
