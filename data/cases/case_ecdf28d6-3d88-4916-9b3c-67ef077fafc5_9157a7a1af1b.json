      "source_text": "Case 12-4\nThe Jesus Christian Transplant:\nBrainwashed into Donating a Kidney?\nAsh Falkingham, a 22-year-old man from Sydney, Australia, wanted to\ndonate one of his kidneys to a stranger in Toronto, Canada, as an act of\nkindness. Through the Internet he met Sandi Sabloff, who needed a kidney\ntransplant. One of her kidneys had failed completely and the second was\nfailing as well. Legal complications prevented him from making the gift in\nAustralia so he traveled to Toronto, Canada.\nPrior to coming to Canada, he had been interviewed by telephone by a\ncommittee. It included a psychiatrist, a social worker, and a bioethicist. On\nMarch 19, 2007, he arrived at Toronto General Hospital where the organ\nprocurement was planned. He had further evaluation including meetings\nwith the committee and medical compatibility testing. Following the\nscreening, the hospital sent a letter to Ms. Sabloff indicating the transplant\nwould occur on April 30.\nSome days later, the hospital began reassessing its decision.\nMr. Falkingham’s mother and stepfather, Kate and Nick Croft, had urged\nthe hospital to review the case further. They claimed he had been unduly\npressured into donating by the religious group, the Jesus Christians. It is a\ngroup that believes it should act on its Christian faith by donating a kidney\nto a stranger as an act of kindness. About half of the thirty members of the\ngroup have donated, including its leader David McKay who had donated\none of his kidneys at the Mayo Clinic in 2003.\nMr. Falkingham’s stepfather was quoted by the National Post newspa-\nper as saying, “I’m certain that the pressure to donate a kidney is one of the\nmany pressures involved in being a member of this group. ... I would say it’s\na cult. I would say it's a sect. I would say it’s a madness.” They claimed that\nthe group coerced members into giving kidneys as a way of gaining public-\nity. Meanwhile, the group claims it is their way of expressing spiritual devo-\ntion and Christian charity. Mr. Falkingham said he was sent to a forensic\npsychiatrist with a specialty related to brainwashing and undue influence.\nAfter some five weeks of waiting, the hospital announced that it was can-\nceling the operation. Robert Bell, the CEO of University Health Network, the\nparent of Toronto General, was quoted by the Toronto-based Globe and Mail\nnewspaper as saying, “We need to make sure the [donor] has informed con-\nsent for what this is all about, without any evidence of coercion and without\nany evidence of value consideration being given to the donation of the tissue.”",
