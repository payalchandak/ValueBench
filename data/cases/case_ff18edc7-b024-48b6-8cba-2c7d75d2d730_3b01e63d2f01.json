The ICU team says he could be intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation while antibiotics and supportive care are given, which might allow recovery from the infection and discharge back to baseline, but it could also lead to days to weeks of invasive ventilation, heavy sedation, and complications in a patient with very limited lung reserve.

She is somnolent but arousable and cannot participate meaningfully in decisions. ABG shows pH 7.22, PaCO2 78 mmHg, PaO2 52 mmHg on a nonrebreather. Chest radiograph suggests right lower-lobe pneumonia. The ICU team believes ventilatory support is likely needed.\n\nHer chart contains a POLST completed 18 months ago that is specific: DNR and DNI (\"Do not intubate\"), with an additional statement in her own words: “No breathing machine down my throat. If my lungs fail again, try BiPAP and medicines. If I’m not improving quickly, keep me comfortable.” However, her daughter (documented health care proxy) reports a later conversation after a neighbor’s ICU stay in which the patient said, “If it’s just pneumonia and they think I can get off the ventilator in a few days, I’d want them to try,” though this was never formally documented.\n\nThe intensivist explains that intubation could be a potentially reversible bridge while antibiotics treat pneumonia, with an estimated 40–50% chance of extubation within 5–7 days if her pneumonia responds; but given her advanced COPD and frailty, there is also a substantial risk of prolonged ventilation, need for tracheostomy, delirium, and discharge to long-term care. Noninvasive ventilation (BiPAP) plus antibiotics may avoid intubation and align with her documented wishes, but it may fail, in which case she could die without receiving a potentially life-prolonging therapy. The central conflict is whether to honor her documented DNI as the best evidence of her autonomy versus pursuing intubation as potentially beneficial treatment in the setting of uncertainty about her most recent preferences.",
