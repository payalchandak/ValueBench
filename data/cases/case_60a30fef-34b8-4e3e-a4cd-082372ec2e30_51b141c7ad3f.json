        "vignette": "A 72-year-old woman presents to the emergency department with acute ischemic stroke symptoms that began approximately 90 minutes ago. She has right-sided weakness and expressive aphasia but can clearly communicate \"no\" by shaking her head and pushing away the physician's hand. Before losing more speech function, she repeatedly stated \"no hospitals, no procedures\" and has an advance directive requesting minimal intervention. Her daughter, who has durable power of attorney but whose authority is not yet activated because the patient retains decision-making capacity, urgently requests that the team proceed with thrombolytic therapy, stating \"she doesn't understand what she's refusing—this could save her brain function.\" The stroke neurologist confirms the patient is within the treatment window and that thrombolysis offers a meaningful chance of significantly reducing permanent disability, though it also carries risks including hemorrhage. The patient continues to refuse by shaking her head whenever treatment is mentioned. You are the emergency physician who must decide whether to proceed with thrombolytic therapy.",
