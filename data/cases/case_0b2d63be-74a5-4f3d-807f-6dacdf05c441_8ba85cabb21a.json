He is widowed, has no advance directive, and never named a surrogate. Two relatives (a daughter and a nephew) insist he would want “everything done,” including continued ventilator support, tube feeding, and dialysis if needed; his son and brother insist he would never want to live this way and ask that all life-prolonging treatment be stopped. Both sides describe past conversations but there is no documentation, and meetings have not produced agreement. The patient is not expected to regain awareness, and ongoing treatment would likely mean prolonged dependence on life support with recurrent complications.

        "vignette": "A 68-year-old man is in the ICU after an out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation arrest with ~25 minutes of CPR before return of spontaneous circulation. He has been mechanically ventilated for 9 days for hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Sedatives have been off for 48 hours. He has no command-following, intermittently opens eyes to pain, and shows extensor posturing. MRI and EEG demonstrate severe diffuse anoxic injury, and neurology estimates a very low likelihood of meaningful neurologic recovery. He is hemodynamically stable but cannot protect his airway.\n\nThe ICU team notes that prolonged translaryngeal intubation beyond ~10–14 days increases the risk of laryngeal/tracheal injury and ventilator-associated complications; by institutional practice a decision about tracheostomy (and often PEG for long-term nutrition) is typically made within the next 24–48 hours. A tracheostomy/PEG are invasive and partly irreversible steps that can prolong dependence; compassionate extubation without ongoing ventilatory support would be expected to lead to death within hours to days.\n\nThere is no clearly authorized surrogate. The patient’s estranged adult daughter says he repeatedly told her he “never wanted to live on machines” after seeing a relative die in a nursing facility. His long-term partner (not legally married) insists he would want “everything” and requests tracheostomy, saying he is a “fighter.” A brother can be reached but says he is unsure and does not want to decide. There is no written advance directive.\n\nRisk management explains that under hospital policy/state law, non-emergent, potentially irreversible procedures like tracheostomy/PEG generally require consent from a legally authorized surrogate; if surrogate authority is disputed, an ethics consult and (if needed) emergency guardianship must be initiated, which will likely take several days. Clinically, both continuing life-sustaining treatment while sorting out surrogate authority and transitioning to comfort-focused care based on a documented best-interest determination are medically permissible; the central ethical tension is honoring likely patient preferences under uncertainty versus avoiding burdensome, low-benefit interventions under time pressure.",
