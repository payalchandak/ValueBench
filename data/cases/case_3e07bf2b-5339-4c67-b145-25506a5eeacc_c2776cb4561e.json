      "source_text": "‘\n’\nThe Case of W\n‘\n’\nW , aged 16, was orphaned at the age of eight, when\nher mother died of cancer. Three years earlier, her\nfather had died of a brain tumour. Together with her\n’\nbrother and sister, W was taken into the care of the\nlocal authority; her aunt, who had been named as\ntestamentary guardian, was unable to care for the\nchildren. After a foster placement broke down, she\nwas moved to a second family, but her new foster\nmother developed breast cancer. Her grandfather, to\nwhom she was very attached, died shortly thereafter,\nwhen W was 13. A few months later W began losing\nff\nweight; she had been su ering from depression and a\nnervous tic for some time before, and she was\nreferred for her eating disorder to the same clinic\nwhich had been treating her other conditions. But\nsessions with a clinical psychologist at the clinic did\nnot really resolve the problems, and shortly before\nher 15th birthday W was admitted on an inpatient\nbasis to a specialist London residential unit for chil-\ndren and adolescents. Here she began injuring herself\nby picking at her skin and other forms of self-harm. A\nfl\nfew months later her condition had deteriorated to\nthe point where she had to be fed by nasogastric\ntube, to which she consented; her arms were encased\nin plaster to prevent her picking at her skin.\nThe local authority decided to move W to another\ntreatment unit, to which W was opposed. She had\nff fi ’\ndeveloped a good relationship with sta at the rst\n–\ncentre, she argued although it was also true that she\nff\nhad occasionally been violent towards sta there.\nHowever, the original treatment centre wanted to\ncontinue working with W and opposed the move.\nHer weight was now stable at about seven stone. In\nMarch 1992 W reached the age of 16 and exercised\nher right to be represented by a solicitor of her own\nchoice. Under the provisions of the Family Law\nReform Act 1969, which treats the treatment choices\n–\nof 16- and 17-year-olds as equally valid to an adult s, it\nappeared that W would have the right to refuse the\ntransfer. The authority made a formal application to\nthe High Court to test whether this was so, requesting\nleave to move W to a named treatment centre with-\nout her consent, and to give her whatever treatment\nthe new centre deemed necessary, also without her\nconsent.\nThe High Court ruled that W was competent, with\nMr Justice Thorpe – also the judge in the C case –\n‘\n’\nstating: There is no doubt at all that [W] is a child of\nffi\nsu cient understanding to make an informed deci-\nsion. This was consistent with the evidence of Dr G, a\nconsultant psychiatrist specializing in anorexia nerv-\n‘\nosa, who noted: I am convinced that she has a good\nintelligence, and understands what is proposed as\n’\ntreatment . It might seem, therefore, that because W\nwas competent, she would be allowed to refuse both\ntransfer to the second centre and the ‘blank cheque’\nwhich the authority was seeking for her treatment\nthere.\nOne could certainly argue that the treatment at\n’\nissue in W s case, the possibility of further arti cial or\nfi\neven forcible feeding, is medical treatment rather than\npsychiatric treatment, and that she should have been\nallowed to refuse it, in the same way that Mr C was\nallowed to refuse amputation. But because there is a\npresumption of incompetence for minors under 18,\nthis was not the case. W had no right to say no, it was\nheld in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal.\nff\nThe e ect of the W case is that young people\nunder 18, even if found competent, are not allowed\nto refuse consent to treatment so long as someone\n’\nwith parental responsibility consents. (In W s case the\nlocal authority had parental responsibility.) The case\n‘\n’\nof W went beyond an earlier judgement, that of R ,\nwhich held that a young person of uctuating mental\ncondition was not competent to refuse treatment (in\n’\nR s case, antipsychotic drugs). W was found compe-\ntent but denied the right to refuse treatment none\nthe less.\nWhereas in the case of Mr C the court was\nimpressed by his dignity of manner and self-control,\nff fi ’\nin W s case her attempts to control her environment,\ncarers and body itself were viewed as pernicious. Lord\nDonaldson called W’s desire for control a ‘pathological\nsymptom of her condition: “One of the symptoms of\nff\nanorexia nervosa is a desire by the su erer to be in\n”\ncontrol , and such a refusal [of treatment] would be\n’\nan obvious way of demonstrating this (Re W, p. 631).\nThis looks particularly odd compared with the C case\n(although the W judgement pre-dates C). It seems\n’\nquite likely that Mr C s refusal was a manifestation of\nhis schizophrenic delusions giving rise to his patho-\nlogical distrust of the clinicians – even if it was also\n’\na desire held by other su erers from vascular disease.\nff\nLord Donaldson argued that W s anorexia under-\n‘\n’\nmined her Gillick competence , the formulation\nlaid down in an earlier case establishing that the\ntest is the ability to understand the nature and pur-\npose of the proposed treatment. The test in the Gillick\n‘ ffi\ncase (1985) was whether the child had su cient\nunderstanding and intelligence to enable him or\nher to understand fully what is proposed’ (Gillick,\np. 423). None the less, Lord Donaldson, in the Court\n’\nof Appeal, declared that this was not enough in\nW s case:\n. . .\nWhat distinguishes W is that it is a feature\nof anorexia nervosa that it is capable of\ndestroying the ability to make an informed\nchoice. It creates a compulsion to refuse treat-\nment or to accept only treatment which is\nff\nlikely to be ine ective. This attitude is part\nand parcel of the disease and the more\nadvanced the illness, the more compelling it\nmay become. Where the wishes of the minor\nare themselves something which the doctors\nreasonably consider to be treated in the\n’\nminor s best interests, those wishes clearly\nfl\nhave a much reduced in uence\n(Re W, p. 637).\nW had broken unit rules at her current treatment\nff\ncentre with impunity, it was noted. A judgement in\nher favour would merely be another form of capit-\nulation, reinforcing her sense that she, not the clini-\ncians, was in control. Throughout the judgement the\n‘\n’\nlanguage of discipline, control and hierarchy is evi-\ndent. Whereas the judge in C seems to regard Mr C\nas his equal, the judgements in W are given from a\npaternalistic position. Thus the W case reinforced\nthe important principle in UK law that children\nand young people are presumed incompetent to\nrefuse treatment, although they may give consent.\nThis is the limit to which their competence can\nextend.",

Earlier in admission she required nasogastric feeds and brief restraint per protocol after repeated tube-dislodgement attempts. She is now medically stable on a supervised meal plan and is engaging with the team. She is in child welfare custody, and the agency holds medical decision-making authority. The agency has a state-funded residential eating-disorder bed that must be accepted today or it will be reassigned. The program offers continuous observation and onsite medical monitoring if intake drops, but it is farther from her family and uses seclusion or restraint more often for nonadherence. This unit can continue evidence-based therapy and medical monitoring, but it has limited capacity for prolonged 1:1 observation, and the inpatient bed is needed for other medically unstable patients. Requesting review would likely forfeit the residential slot and prolong use of scarce 1:1 staffing. She understands both plans and refuses transfer.",
