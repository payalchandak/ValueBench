Near the end of a session he becomes guarded, asks you to promise you will not repeat what he says, and then describes a fixed belief that his supervisor is “ruining his life.” He says he has been thinking about killing the supervisor “when the time is right,” adds that he has access to a weapon at home, and refuses to let you contact family or involve his employer because he fears retaliation and says he will never come back if you “betray” him. He is not intoxicated, denies wanting to die, and will not agree to voluntary hospitalization; you must decide what to do before he leaves clinic.",
