At diagnosis she is fully alert and demonstrates clear understanding of the disease, the recommended surgery, and alternatives. She states repeatedly that she does not want breast surgery under any circumstances and signs a refusal that is scanned into the chart. Her husband and adult son strongly disagree and ask you to “do what’s best” if she changes. Several weeks later she develops worsening confusion from an unrelated medical illness and now cannot explain her condition or weigh options. The tumor board slot for surgery is available next week, and delaying longer may narrow treatment options. Her husband and son, as her default surrogates, request that you proceed with surgery now. Hospital policy and state law permit either honoring a prior documented refusal or following a surrogate’s current consent when capacity is lost.",

At a follow-up call a week later she told a nurse she would consider a limited operation if her family could be present, but no revised preference was documented. She now has persistent delirium after sepsis and metabolic derangements and lacks decision-making capacity on exam. Recovery is expected to be prolonged. She is frail and at high risk for postoperative delirium, loss of independence, and need for institutional care. The breast surgeon has an operating date next week; if it is missed, definitive treatment may be delayed for several weeks and oncologic outcomes may worsen. Bridging systemic therapy is not feasible given her current organ dysfunction. Hospital counsel advises that either honoring the earlier refusal or accepting surrogate consent can be legally supportable if well documented.",
