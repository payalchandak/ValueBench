Occupational thera-\npist Mark Petty, OTR/L (licensed occupational therapist), enjoyed the busy\npace and the variety of clients he saw in the clinic. Mr. Petty was assigned a\nnew client, Lee Tung, a 28-year-old automobile manufacturing worker, who\nhad sustained a severe crush injury of his hand on the job. Mr. Petty noted\nthat there were orders to evaluate and begin treatment. As he read further in\nMr. Tung’s medical record, he saw that the physician specifically requested\na certified hand therapist's (CHT) services. Mr. Petty was not a CHT, so he\napproached his supervisor, Vivian Cunningham, to discuss the problem.\nMr. Petty explained that the physician's orders specified a CHT.\n“How soon can Mr. Tung see the CHT?” he asked his supervisor.\n“She's just too busy to take any new clients,” Ms. Cunningham responded.\n“T'll tell you what to do. I would hate to lose this case. It looks like it will take\nat least a year of service to rehabilitate Mr. Tung. It is part of our hospital's\nofficially adopted code of ethics that we must work always for the good of the\npatient. Why don't you just go ahead and provide services to him and have\nthe CHT sign the notes? She can check to make sure that your treatment\nplan is appropriate. Who will know the difference?” Ms. Cunningham then\nwalked away.\nMr. Petty was left standing in the middle of the hallway with Mr. Tung’s\nchart in his hand and a perplexed look on his face. Provide services to a\nclient and have someone else sign off on them? On the face of it, that\nseemed very wrong. Yet he, too, would hate to lose this interesting case,\nand he knew that Mr. Tung should start therapy as soon as possible. He\nwas convinced that the therapy the patient would receive would be supe-\nrior to any alternatives available. He had briefly met Mr. Tung and instantly\nliked him. Would anyone really know the difference if he provided the care\nor if the CHT did? Mr. Petty wondered what the right thing was to do.",

The wounds are closed. Perfusion is intact, but the hand is edematous and hypersensitive. He is in a dorsal blocking splint. He is doing protected passive flexion and active extension at home. He is starting to lose motion. He says he will be fired if he cannot return soon. His workers’ compensation coverage for therapy ends in 10 days unless visits start in-system. The surgeon’s protocol allows early protected motion with expert in-person splinting or short added immobilization if that expertise is unavailable. The only certified hand therapist cannot see him for 3–4 weeks, and policy and insurance bar outside referral. A licensed OT can start tomorrow, but remote supervision cannot adjust splints or catch subtle vascular or tendon problems in real time. The patient understands that starting now may increase rupture or vascular compromise risk, while waiting may cause adhesions and permanent stiffness and could end his therapy coverage. He asks to start tomorrow. Hospital counsel confirms both paths are permissible.",
