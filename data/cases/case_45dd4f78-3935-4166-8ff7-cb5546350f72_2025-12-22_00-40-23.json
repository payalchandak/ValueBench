      "source_text": "CASE 60:\nCHILDHOOD IMMUNISATION\nSophie’s first child, Alfie, is 3 months old. She had an easy pregnancy and uncomplicated\nbirth. Alfie is happy and thriving. Sophie regularly takes him to meet with other mums from\nher antenatal group. A few of those mothers have said that they are not going to take their children to the GP to have the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine because they are\nworried about the side effects. Sophie is concerned to hear this. She and her husband had\nintended to take Alfie for all the routine immunisations because they want to do what is best\nfor him. The mothers’ talk is making Sophie doubt if this is the case.\nQuestions\n• Are childhood immunisations compulsory?\n• Can parents legally refuse to have their child immunised? What if they disagree?\n• Are there any ethical justifications for non-immunisation?",
