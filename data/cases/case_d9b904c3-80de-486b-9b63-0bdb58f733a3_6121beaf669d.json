Richard Huxtable and Maaike Möller outline the main features of the case:\nIn April 1998, Dr Philip Sutorius assisted 86-year-old Edward Brongersma to commit suicide. Brongersma was motivated by ‘life fatigue’ or ‘existential suffering’, and had no somatic or psychiatric medical condition. Sutorius was prosecuted for failing to observe one of the ‘due care’ criteria on which the Dutch policy was based, namely that he ‘should, on reasonable grounds, be satisfied that the suffering is unbearable and that there is no prospect of improvement’.\n(Huxtable and Möller, 2007, p. 118)",

He says he is “tired of living” and finds daily life empty and humiliating. He denies depression, psychosis, or coercion. A psychiatrist finds no treatable mental illness. He has no serious medical disease and is physically independent. He refuses psychotherapy and social programs, saying they would only prolong a life he no longer wants. He has drafted letters to family and set a date within the next two weeks. He says that if you will not assist, he will attempt suicide alone and does not want his daughter to find him. Hospital policy and national law permit either providing physician-assisted dying after consultation or declining and continuing supportive care. A second physician is available to review the case this week.",
