He has\nan infected, draining toe with bone exposed, cellulitis, and x-ray evidence\nof osteomyelitis brought on by the poor arterial circulation related to his\nIDDM. He is noncompliant in visits to the outpatient clinic for care of his\ninfection, has no insurance coverage, refuses social worker and psychiat-\nric consults, and now is refusing further debridement of the decaying tissue\naround the infection.\nMr. Johnson had on previous visits been seen by a consulting psychia-\ntrist who found him to be eccentric, a semiretired man who had done janito-\nrial work and odd jobs through his adult life. The psychiatrist had found\nsome depression but no evidence of mental illness that would have made it\npossible to declare him incompetent.\nDr. Maria Garcia was very concerned about the infection. She was\nafraid that he would lose the toe or, worse, the foot, from gangrene if\nMr. Johnson did not receive aggressive treatment.\nShe contemplated hospitalizing him and using sedation in order to\ntreat the foot. She could not imagine his losing a toe or foot simply because\nhe was so stubborn he would not agree to her recommendation.",

        "vignette": "A 60-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes and severe peripheral arterial disease presents with a malodorous toe ulcer with purulent discharge. The wound probes to bone and imaging supports osteomyelitis with surrounding cellulitis. Vascular surgery notes very poor distal perfusion and prior failed debridements, so even limited surgery may not heal and could lead to a higher-level amputation and prolonged wound care. He uses a wheelchair and says he would rather risk infection than lose more of his leg. He refuses debridement and asks to leave. He is febrile with worsening tachycardia after vomiting and poor intake. His mental status fluctuates. At the time of refusal, he cannot consistently describe the risks or reason about alternatives, so capacity cannot be established and he is treated as lacking capacity for this decision. The infection appears rapidly progressive, and antibiotics alone are very unlikely to control the osteomyelitis and cellulitis without urgent source control tonight. No surrogate is reachable. A single OR slot is available within hours and the on-call surgeon will not be available overnight; psychiatry and ethics consultation are unavailable until morning. Hospital counsel confirms either course is legally permissible.",
