During an unusually busy night shift, a patient\nstarts shouting about how the department is too slow and is staffed by lazy foreigners. Various\nmembers of staff have tried to diffuse the situation but this encourages him even more.\nAt first, other patients join in his banter. Every time you walk through the waiting area, the\npatient makes increasingly insulting comments about you and other nonwhite staff members\nand patients. Other patients are beginning to feel uncomfortable and the atmosphere in the\nwaiting room is changing. He is next to be seen by you. You call him into the treatment area\nbut he refuses, stating he wants to be seen by a ‘British’ doctor only.\nQuestions\n• How will you deal with this situation?\n• What is your legal duty of care to this patient and the other patients?\n• What are your ethical obligations?",

Other patients are now visibly uncomfortable and the waiting room is becoming tense. He is next to be seen by you, the treating physician on duty. When you call him into a treatment cubicle, he refuses and says he will only be seen by a “British” doctor.

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old man presents to the emergency department with chest tightness and worsening shortness of breath. He is alert, speaking in full sentences, and his vital signs and oxygenation are stable. An initial ECG and chest pain labs have not yet been obtained. While waiting, he repeatedly uses racially derogatory language toward staff. He demands a clinician of a specific race or nationality and refuses evaluation unless that request is met. The disruption is escalating, and he has begun making physical threats and throwing objects. Security has been asked to stand by. There is one open treatment space now. The next available emergency clinician is tied up with another high-acuity patient, so reassignment would likely delay this man’s ECG and troponin testing by about an hour and shift the abusive behavior to a colleague. Reassignment would also accommodate a discriminatory request and could pull attention from other patients. Keeping him under your care with security and firm behavior limits would likely allow immediate ECG and labs, but it may require disproportionate staff and security resources and still carry safety risk. Hospital policy allows case-by-case discretion, and counsel confirms either approach is legally permissible. You must decide now who will evaluate him.",
