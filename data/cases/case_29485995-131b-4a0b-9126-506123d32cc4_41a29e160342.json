      "source_text": ". Case 10-5\nAbortion for Socioeconomic Reasons\nIn March of 1970 Norma McCorvey was unmarried and pregnant, living in\nDallas County, Texas. She signed an affidavit claiming she wished to ter-\nminate her pregnancy by an abortion. She wanted it done by a competent,\nlicensed physician and under safe, clinical conditions. Although there has\nbeen some dispute about whether the affidavit stated her actual wishes, it\nstated she was distressed that her right of privacy was put in jeopardy be-\ncause the Texas law was so vague that physicians might be reluctant to\nperform an abortion for a woman in her situation out of fear that it would be\nillegal.\nMs. McCorvey was a working-class blue-collar woman of 24 who\nthought of herself as tough-talking and of unrefined ways. She was raised\nas a poor Louisiana girl who had spent a good part of her childhood in\nreform schools. She ran away from home when she was 10, then supported\nherself with odd jobs as a carnival barker, waitress, cleaner of apartments,\nand construction worker. She had had three previous pregnancies, all of\nwhich had resulted in live births with the children placed for adoption. In\none case, the removal of the child was against her will. She realized she\ndid not meet the criterion of wanting to discontinue a pregnancy to save her\nlife or prevent serious medical problems. She was simply at a point at\nwhich financially, psychologically, and emotionally she should not have\nmore children.\nJames Hubert Hallford, who was a licensed physician in Texas, entered\nthe case testifying that he, in fact, was sufficiently concerned about the\nvagueness of the Texas law that he feared performing abortions. He had\nbeen arrested for performing them and had two prosecutions pending. He\nargued that he could not tell whether his participation in an abortion for a\npatient like Norma McCorvey was legal, that the law was too vague, and\nthat it violated the privacy of the doctor—patient relation and his own right\nto practice medicine.\nThis case became world-famous when Ms. McCorvey was referred to\nas Jane Roe of the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that declared\nlaws restricting abortions unconstitutional. Now that abortion is legal,\nwomen like Ms. McCorvey must make the ethical choice of whether an\nabortion for psychological and socioeconomic reasons like hers would be\nmorally justified.'",

        "vignette": "A 24-year-old woman at 9 weeks’ gestation requests a medication abortion. Dating ultrasound and screening show no contraindications. She understands the procedure and alternatives and that she can decline. She asks whether today’s visit will appear on her phone portal. She reports that her partner checks her messages and controls her transportation. Staff note the partner is in the waiting area repeatedly calling the front desk to confirm the visit is completed. In a brief moment alone, she says her partner has been pressuring her to end the pregnancy and she is not sure what she wants. She would consider continuing the pregnancy if she had stable housing, but she fears being forced out if she remains pregnant. She denies intoxication and current suicidal thoughts. She has a remote history of depression and a prior ED visit for intentional self-injury. The clinic has an unexpected opening today. It is the last available medication-abortion slot this week. The next clinic appointment is after its 10-week medication limit, and she may be unable to return tomorrow. Hospital policy allows same-day abortion if voluntariness is documented, or a short deferral for a second-clinician and advocacy evaluation when coercion is suspected.",
