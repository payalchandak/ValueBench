Her husband, her main carer, was admitted yesterday with pneumonia. He men-\ntioned to staff that his wife was at home alone and was concerned she might not be managing\nwithout him.\nAfter she failed to answer the staff’s phone calls, an ambulance was dispatched, and she was\nfound in her chair, dehydrated and unable to mobilise. Since her husband’s admission she\nhad been too weak and breathless to get up, and had been unable to get herself anything to\neat or drink.\nFortunately her test results are normal and the A&E doctor suggests she stays overnight\nso a carer can be arranged the following morning. The doctor explains to Nora they are\nconcerned that if she goes home she may become dehydrated or have a fall. Nora is adamant\nshe wants to go home, stating that she is fine, would rather sleep in her own bed, and will take\na sandwich from A&E for supper. She starts getting up and making her way towards the door.\nShe has no history of mental health problems.\nQuestions\n• How should doctors approach patients who make decisions they consider unwise?\n• What issues arise from the complex interplay between health and social care,\nparticularly during out of hours?",

In the ED she is alert and conversant, but intermittently dozes off and struggles to explain how she will manage at home tonight. Basic labs and imaging show no new acute problem, and she improves after fluids and oxygen. She insists on going home now, saying she needs her own bed and will “be fine until morning.” Overnight community support cannot be arranged until daytime services open.
