Her family has requested that she\nis only seen by female staff and that she is treated in a side room since the patient and her\nfamily are all strict Muslims. The hospital has managed to accommodate these requests.\nInitial investigations do not reveal why Latisha is critically unwell and her Glasgow Coma\nScale score continues to drop. Her younger sister comes to speak to you to tell you that she\nis worried that Latisha may have attempted to commit suicide since she had a massive argu-\nment with their father, who had found out that Latisha has a non-Muslim boyfriend. You\ndecide to test her blood for drug levels. Before being able to take more blood for toxicology\nscreening Latisha has a cardiac arrest. Despite three cycles of cardiopulmonary resuscita-\ntion (CPR) she never regains a heartbeat. She is pronounced dead at 20.17 hours, 3 hours\nafter her admission to hospital. You know that a postmortem is legally required and go to\ndiscuss this with her family.\nQuestions\n• Which religions do not allow postmortem examinations?\n• Can a postmortem not be performed if there is religious or cultural opposition to it?\n• What should you say to Latisha’s family in this situation?",

She is accompanied by her younger sister, who asks that only female staff examine her and that she remain in a private room for religious reasons. You accommodate this. Initial labs and imaging do not explain her rapid decline. Shortly before she loses the ability to participate in decisions, her sister quietly reports a recent family conflict and worries about possible self-poisoning. The patient arrests and dies despite resuscitation. The family requests immediate release of the body for burial today and refuses any post-death examination. The cause of death remains unclear, and the hospital’s unexpected-death review process strongly encourages autopsy to guide safety reporting and future care standards. Hospital counsel confirms that either honoring the family’s refusal or requesting a medicolegal review that could proceed without consent is legally permissible.

        "vignette": "A 24-year-old woman is evaluated in the ED for sudden confusion and progressive somnolence. She has epilepsy and recently missed doses. Her exam, basic labs, head CT, and ECG show no clear infectious, hemorrhagic, or structural cause. Her sister privately mentions a possible pill ingestion at home, but it is secondhand and uncorroborated. The patient had previously told her family she would not want an autopsy or specimens kept. Before additional tests can be sent, she has a cardiac arrest and dies despite resuscitation. The family says their faith requires burial today. They refuse any delay, specimen retention, imaging, or postmortem examination. Determining a toxic exposure could prompt warnings or evaluation for others in the home and guide family counseling. Sudden unexplained deaths with possible overdose are usually reportable to the medical examiner. Counsel confirms you may either complete the death certificate and release the body or report the death to the medical examiner, who could order a full autopsy without family consent. The funeral home will arrive within hours.",
