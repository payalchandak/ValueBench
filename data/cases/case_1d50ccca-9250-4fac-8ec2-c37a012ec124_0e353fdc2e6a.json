        "vignette": "An 82-year-old woman with moderate dementia but retained decision-making capacity is hospitalized on the general ward for pneumonia. She has been increasingly unsteady, and yesterday suffered a fall without injury. The nursing staff reports she frequently attempts to get out of bed unassisted despite reminders to call for help, placing her at high risk for serious falls and fractures. Her cognition is sufficient that she understands the fall risk when reminded, but she forgets within minutes and insists she can manage on her own. The physical therapy team has assessed her and confirms significant fall risk. The attending physician must decide whether to implement bed rails and a bed alarm, which the patient finds distressing and has explicitly refused, or to respect her refusal and accept the elevated risk of a potentially devastating fall during her hospital stay.",

The clinical superiority of restrictive measures is actually contested in geriatrics literature. Rephrase to: '...placing her at increased risk for falls. The attending physician must decide whether to implement bed rails and a bed alarm, which may reduce some fall risks but which the patient finds distressing and has refused, or to respect her refusal and manage fall risk through staffing adjustments and environmental modifications.'"
