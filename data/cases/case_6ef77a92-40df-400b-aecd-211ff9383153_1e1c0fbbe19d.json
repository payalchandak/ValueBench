      "source_text": "The case of Leslie Burke\r\nMr Burke was suffering from cerebellar ataxia, which meant that his physical condition was deteriorating, but not his mental competence. It seemed that he would at some point need—and he wanted to receive—artificial nutrition and hydration. Guidance had been formulated by the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK about when life-supporting treatment might, and might not, be offered to patients like Mr Burke, and he feared that the guidance indicated that he would not be eligible to receive artificial food and fluids. He was most concerned that, if he lost his mental competence, the doctors would be entitled to stop (or not start) this treatment, with the effect that his life would come to an end.\r\nMr Burke approached the court, arguing that the guidance violated his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, which had been incorporated directly into English law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Mr Burke specifically objected to the infringement of his right to life, his right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, his right to determine what treatment he should receive and his right to equal respect before the law irrespective of any physical or mental disability.",

He fears that when he can no longer swallow, clinicians will decline artificial nutrition and hydration and he will die earlier than he wants. He asks you to document now that he wants long-term tube feeding and IV fluids even if he later cannot speak or loses decision-making capacity. His spouse supports him, but the care team worries that tube feeding may prolong a phase of severe disability and repeated infections without restoring interaction. They also worry about committing future clinicians to an intervention they may judge non-beneficial at the time. Hospital policy and applicable law allow either honoring this request in an advance plan or declining to offer it based on future clinical judgment. You need to finalize the plan at today’s visit.",
