As a result she is\ncompletely bed bound and requires full-time care in a nursing home. She saw her GP with a\ncomplaint of a change in bowel habits and rectal bleeding and was referred for a colonoscopy.\nCancer was diagnosed and originally she consented to have surgical removal of the tumour.\nAnne has been listed for surgery. Anne’s adult daughter, Wendy, was her mother’s sole carer\nprior to her going into the nursing home and she visits Anne every day. Wendy has expressed\nto the consultant her concern that the operation is not in her mother’s best interests. She says\nthat her mother lives a miserable life, in the past she expressed a wish to die and, as the cancer\npresents an opportunity for her mother to die naturally, intervention would be inappropriate.\nAfter Wendy’s visit the doctor speaks to Anne, who tells him that she has changed her mind\nand she no longer wishes to have the operation.\nQuestions\n• Should a change of mind about treatment be respected?\n• In what circumstances can discussion with family amount to coercion such that the\npatient’s decision is no longer valid?",

She was evaluated for rectal bleeding and found to have a resectable colon cancer. In clinic last month, she discussed the operation, asked questions, and signed consent. Pre-op testing is complete and surgery is scheduled for tomorrow morning. Her adult daughter visits daily and tells the surgical team that her mother has long “wanted to be allowed to die,” and that surgery would prolong a life she considers intolerable. After a long visit, the patient tells you she no longer wants the operation and asks you to “just let it be.” Staff report the daughter often speaks for her. Today the patient is groggy after a new antispasmodic and struggles to explain her reasons. The OR needs confirmation tonight.

        "vignette": "A 68-year-old woman with advanced multiple sclerosis is bedbound in a nursing facility. She has colon cancer with recurrent rectal bleeding and worsening anemia. Surgeons estimate resection would likely stop bleeding and reduce transfusion needs, and delay of months risks obstruction and further decline. Her MS increases perioperative burden, including higher risk of postoperative respiratory failure, ICU care, and prolonged recovery. Over two outpatient visits she was alert, asked questions, and repeatedly stated she wanted surgery; she signed consent. There is no POLST or advance directive, and her daughter is not a designated proxy. Surgery is scheduled for tomorrow, and the OR requires a go/no-go decision tonight. This week a new antispasmodic was started, and today she is intermittently drowsy with fluctuating attention. She says “no surgery” and asks to decide when she is more awake. She cannot consistently explain risks and alternatives, and later tells a nurse she is “not sure.” The daughter often answers first and spoke with her privately before the refusal. A capacity consult is not available overnight. Hospital counsel confirms that either proceeding or postponing is legally permissible. Nonoperative, comfort-focused care is also reasonable.",
