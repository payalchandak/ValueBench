      "source_text": "CASE 52:\nPERSONAL IDENTITY\nMelissa, a 30-year-old woman, had always been hard-working and conscientious but had\noften doubted her abilities and worried about her performance at school, university and\nwork. She was shy and nervous in new situations. She had suffered from depressive episodes\nsince her final year at university and had counselling on various occasions, which she found\nhelpful. Recently, in the space of a few months, she was promoted to a stressful position\nat work, her mother died unexpectedly, and her boyfriend of 4 years left her having met\nsomeone else. She felt permanently tired, lacking in motivation and enthusiasm, and was\napt to burst into tears at the slightest provocation. She sought psychiatric help, was diag-\nnosed with depression and was prescribed a course of antidepressant medication. Melissa\nresponded well to the medication and stopped feeling tired and unhappy and unable to\ncope. She stopped worrying about her abilities and her performance at work and found her\njob much more enjoyable. Where previously she had felt shy or nervous in new situations,\nshe felt more confident and convinced of her own ability to contribute.\nSometime after the course of medication finished, Melissa found herself returning to her\nprevious state. She was less self-confident and more concerned about whether her abilities\nwere adequate for the job she had to do. She was not prone to crying or permanently tired as\nshe had been when the medication was prescribed, but she felt shy and nervous and unable to\nexpress herself as fully as she had done when on the medication. She felt lacking in motiva-\ntion and ‘flat’.\nEventually, Melissa asked her psychiatrist whether she could be prescribed the medication\nagain, saying that it was only when on the medication that she had felt her true self. She now\nrealised that the shy, nervous worrier she had previously been was not really her at all, and\nshe wanted to give her real self the chance to come through again.\nQuestions\n• Should Melissa have been given medication in the first instance, given that she had\npreviously found non-pharmacological treatment for her depressive episodes to be\nsuccessful?\n• Should she be prescribed the medication again?\n• What does it mean to say that one has a ‘true’ or ‘real’ self, and to say that one’s real\nself can only be expressed with the aid of medication?",

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old woman has recurrent depressive episodes. Months ago, after multiple losses and a new high-pressure job, she started an SSRI and improved quickly. She felt more confident and outgoing and said she could finally “be herself.” After tapering off, she is not tearful or exhausted, but she feels flat, self-doubting, and socially anxious again. She is still working but is struggling to speak up in meetings and is afraid she will lose her position during an upcoming performance review. She asks to restart the SSRI long term. She reports bothersome sexual side effects and some emotional “numbing” when she was on it, but she also fears sliding back into a deeper depression if she relies on therapy alone.

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old woman has a history of recurrent major depressive episodes (two prior episodes, one with passive suicidal ideation but no attempts). She has no history of mania, psychosis, or substance use. Last year she started sertraline for a work- and grief-related relapse and had improvement in mood and social functioning. She stopped it after 8 months due to markedly decreased libido that strained her relationship and emotional blunting that affected her work. Tapering was difficult and she had weeks of dizziness and irritability. Six weeks after stopping, she is not in a full depressive episode but reports low motivation, self-doubt, and prominent social anxiety. Her performance review is in one month, and she wants a plan today. CBT is evidence-based but may take several weeks to meaningfully reduce symptoms. Her insurer will cover either weekly psychotherapy or medication visits for the next three months, not both. Given her history, delaying medication could allow progression to major depression and return of suicidal ideation during this period. She demonstrates capacity and denies current suicidal intent.",
