        "vignette": "A 54-year-old with newly diagnosed acute leukemia is in the ICU with severe pneumonia and respiratory failure shortly after starting induction chemotherapy. After several days of sedation, they are awake, oriented, and clearly able to explain their situation and reasoning. The ICU and oncology teams believe the infection is treatable and that, if they remain on the ventilator and complete antibiotics, they could regain enough strength to resume curative-intent cancer therapy. The patient says they feel trapped and do not want any more machines or ICU care; they ask to be taken off the ventilator even if it means they may die sooner, and they decline further chemotherapy if they survive. The ICU attending must decide how to respond to this request.",
