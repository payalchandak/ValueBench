        "vignette": "A 72-year-old man with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presents to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress. He is alert, oriented, and able to communicate clearly. His oxygen saturation is declining despite high-flow oxygen, and he is working hard to breathe. The emergency physician judges that without intubation and mechanical ventilation, the patient will likely experience progressive respiratory failure and die within hours. However, the patient has been intubated twice before for similar exacerbations, and both experiences involved prolonged, difficult weaning, severe delirium, and what he describes as unbearable suffering. He clearly and repeatedly states that he does not want to be intubated again under any circumstances, even if it means he will die. He acknowledges he understands the consequences of this decision. The physician is concerned that without intubation, the patient will experience significant air hunger and distress during his final hours, despite maximal comfort measures. The patient's family is present and pleading with him to accept intubation, but he remains firm in his refusal. You are the treating emergency physician and must decide how to proceed.",
