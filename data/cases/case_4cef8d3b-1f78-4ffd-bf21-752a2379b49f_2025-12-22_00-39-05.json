      "source_text": "Case 9-4\nClaire Conroy: Are Medically Supplied Nutrition\nand Hydration Expendable?\nIn 1983, after many years of medical problems, Claire Conroy was 84 years\nold. She had long suffered from organic brain syndrome and had been le-\ngally incompetent since 1979. She was a resident at Parklane Nursing Home\nin Bloomfield, NJ. Her nephew, Thomas Whittemore, was her only living\nrelative and her guardian. In July of 1982, her left foot was gangrenous and\namputation was recommended. Mr. Whittemore refused consent for the am-\nputation, claiming that Miss Conroy has always resisted medical involve-\nment. It is testimony to the evolution of the right of patients and their\nsurrogates to refuse medical treatment in the days since Karen Quinlan\nthat Mr. Whittemore’s right to refuse on these grounds was not challenged\nlegally even though the gangrene was a serious, possibly life-threatening\ncondition. While she was hospitalized in conjunction with the treatment of\nthe gangrene, medical personnel noticed that Miss Conroy was not receiv-\ning adequate nourishment and placed a naso-gastric (NG) tube to provide\nbetter nutrition. By 1983, when the case became public, she was totally de-\npendent on the tube for feeding.\nMiss Conroy had many other medical problems. In addition to the\nsevere organic brain syndrome, she had necrotic decubitus ulcers on her\nleft foot, leg, and hip, a urinary tract infection, hypertension, arterioscle-\nrotic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus and was unable to move except\nfor minor movements of her head, neck, and arms. She did not speak. She\nlay in a fetal position, only sometimes followed people with her eyes, and\nher general physical appearance was very withered. She moaned when\nmoved or touched. It was unclear whether she was capable of experiencing\npain. She showed no signs of cognitive or volitional functioning.\nUsing reasoning similar to that in defending the refusal of the amputa-\ntion, Mr. Whittemore now insisted that the NG tube be removed.\nThe doctors were reluctant to go along. They accepted the legitimacy of\nrefusing ventilators or amputations but considered provision of food and\nfluids as basic medical care, something they expected to provide to all\npatients who needed them.",

The daughter is reachable by phone and says she “doesn’t want her to suffer,” but also worries that “if we don’t replace it, we’re starving her.” Clinically, the team explains that in advanced dementia PEG feeding is unlikely to improve survival, prevent aspiration, or heal pressure injuries, and repeated replacements/restraints are causing significant distress and iatrogenic harm.",
