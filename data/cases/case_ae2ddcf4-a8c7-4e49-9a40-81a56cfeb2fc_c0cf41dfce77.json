At 23 weeks gestation, she was discovered unconscious at\nhome by her husband. She was rushed to hospital but deteriorated further in the A&E depart-\nment. She required intubating and was transferred to ITU. Over the next few days multiple\ntests are performed to try and determine the cause of collapse. She is found to have suffered\na catastrophic intracranial haemorrhage. Despite multiple attempts to wean ventilation and\nsee if she could breathe alone, there was no return of spontaneous respiration. Review by two\nindependent consultants confirms that she has suffered brainstem death and that there is\nno chance of recovery. The review and scan by the obstetricians show that she has a healthy\n23 week live foetus.\nHer husband pleads that the life support machine is not switched off in order to nurture the\nbaby to a viable gestation. He feels that this is what Holly would have wanted.\nQuestions\n• What tests are performed to diagnose brainstem death?\n• Does a person who is declared dead have any interests?\n• Is it lawful and ethical for somatic support to be continued until viability of\nthe foetus?",

Ultrasound shows a reassuring fetal heart rate and no anomalies. Neonatology says a live birth would require weeks of physiologic support and the neonatal outcome is uncertain. The spouse requests continued ventilation and escalating ICU interventions and reports the patient had explicitly stated that if she were declared brain-dead while pregnant, she would want life support continued for fetal benefit. Her sister recalls a general wish to avoid prolonged machine support, but they never discussed pregnancy or neurologic death. Ongoing interventions cannot benefit the patient and would require vasopressors, transfusions, invasive lines, and possibly dialysis, with rising risks of infection and bleeding. If support is withdrawn, fetal demise is expected within minutes to hours. The ICU is at capacity and blood products are limited. You must decide today whether to escalate or withdraw.",
