Over the past week, Jessica\nhas noticed that her registrar frequently turns up late and has often not shaved. He has a\nreputation for enjoying a good night out and has occasionally turned up with a hangover.\nHowever, Jessica is concerned that there are incidents where he appears drunk and that this\nis beginning to affect his concentration and the level of care he is providing to his patients.\nHe often rushes or neglects his bedside care of patients.\nJessica asks the registrar if he is feeling OK, but he irritably brushes her aside and says that it\nis none of her business. Jessica is unsure what to do next.\nQuestions\n• What is whistleblowing?\n• What are the legal protections for a whistleblower?\n• Does Jessica have a professional duty to report?",

A 62-year-old with an open ankle fracture arrives from the ED; the wound is contaminated and the limb is threatened without timely washout and stabilization. The registrar covering trauma is the only senior surgeon in the hospital, but when you meet him you notice slurred speech, unsteady gait, and an odor of alcohol; he dismisses your concerns and wants to take the patient straight to theatre. The consultant is reachable by phone but lives far away, and transferring the patient to a tertiary centre would delay surgery and risk worsening infection and tissue damage. As the junior doctor asked to prepare the patient and coordinate the team, you must decide how to proceed.",
