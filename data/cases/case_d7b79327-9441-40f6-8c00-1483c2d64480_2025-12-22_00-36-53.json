The child has no major comorbidities and was previously healthy. The ECMO consultant estimates that veno-venous ECMO would offer a 55–65% chance of survival to discharge, but with significant risks: ~15% risk of major intracranial hemorrhage, ~10% risk of serious neurologic injury, and likely weeks of rehabilitation if the child survives.\n\nWhile you are evaluating the child, your transfer center calls: a 7-year-old at a neighboring hospital with fulminant viral myocarditis is deteriorating on maximal inotropes and mechanical ventilation. The referring team requests urgent veno-arterial ECMO. They are 90 minutes away by ground, and their child’s predicted survival with VA-ECMO is 75–85% with lower expected long-term morbidity than the current patient. Without ECMO, the myocarditis patient is likely to die within hours.\n\nYour hospital has no written ECMO triage policy for simultaneous or near-simultaneous candidates; decisions are made case-by-case by the attending intensivist with input from cardiology and the ECMO director. The 3-year-old’s parents, after a detailed discussion of benefits, risks (including stroke/bleeding), and uncertainty, explicitly request ECMO because they believe “we have to try everything,” and they demonstrate understanding that ECMO may prolong suffering without guaranteeing survival.\n\nYou must decide whether to initiate ECMO now for the 3-year-old, knowing it would consume the only circuit and team for days and almost certainly prevent offering ECMO to the incoming myocarditis patient, or to defer/decline ECMO for the current child to preserve the resource for the anticipated transfer.",
