The examination was\npart of Dr. Newlander’s standard procedure to look for any dermatological .\nproblems. On Ms. Harris's back, Dr. Newlander saw a brown, mole-like spot\nthat alarmed him. The color was varied; the edges ragged. He could not\nrecall seeing it before.\nDr. Newlander's first thought was that it looked rather like it could\nbe melanoma. Of course, he would not know without excising the tissue\nand getting a report from the lab. He wanted the tissue removed as soon as\npossible and asked Ms. Harris to schedule an appointment. Dr. Newlander\nsuggested an opening in his schedule later in the week.\nMs. Harris asked him what the hurry was. She asked him, “Do you\nthink it is cancer or something?” That was precisely Dr. Newlander's con-\ncern, but he did not wish to alarm her and, in fact, could not know without\nthe lab results. He was strongly committed to dealing honestly with patients\nbut knew that he did not know the full answer to her question. How should\nhe respond to her question?",

She asks why it needs to be done so soon and whether you think it is cancer. She has a history of severe health anxiety and previously avoided follow-up after a frightening discussion of “worst-case” possibilities.

        "vignette": "A 46-year-old woman comes for a routine visit. You notice a new brown macule on her upper back with color variation and an irregular border. You cannot diagnose it by inspection, but it could represent melanoma or another atypical lesion. You offer an in-office excision/biopsy later this week; the next available slot after that is several weeks away. She has severe health anxiety. After a prior visit where “cancer” was mentioned, she had a panic attack, cancelled follow-up, and avoided care for months. If she panics and leaves again, she is likely to avoid care for months, delaying diagnosis and treatment if this is melanoma. Today she says she will not schedule the biopsy unless you answer directly whether you suspect cancer, but she also says hearing that word may make her “bolt.” In your clinic, clinicians may use staged disclosure when patients request it, as long as nothing false is said and the procedure’s purpose, risks, and alternatives are explained and documented. You must respond now.",
