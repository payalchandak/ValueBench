      "source_text": "CASE 72:\nPROVISION OF FUTILE TREATMENT\nMrs Hauser is a 48-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer that has spread to her\nbrain, despite numerous treatments over years. She is currently an inpatient at a private\nhospital, having rapidly deteriorated over the last few weeks. She is now bedbound, requires\na feeding tube as she can no longer swallow safely and is finding it difficult to communi-\ncate, although she can understand information given to her and clearly indicate her wishes.\nMrs Hauser is receiving high-energy nutritional supplements down her feeding tube at her\nrequest, even though her body is no longer able to gain energy or nutrition from them due to\nher advanced disease. She is likely to die within the next few weeks. Mrs Hauser is supported\nby her husband and three teenage children. The entire family has actively and aggressively\npursued all treatment options, switching oncologists to gain access to experimental treat-\nments, some of which are not routinely available in Britain.\nMrs Hauser has repeatedly requested all possible interventions and treatments. Driven not\njust by a desire to keep living, she has expressed a strong need to prove to her children that\nshe will never give up fighting the cancer, equating giving up with abandoning her family.\nMrs Hauser has regularly declined offers of psychological support. She has previously given\nfully informed consent to risky treatments which did not have a strong body of evidence that\nthey would provide a benefit and accepted significant side effects throughout her treatments.\nMrs Hauser had been scheduled for her next chemotherapy in one week’s time and both she\nand her husband are insistent it goes ahead, despite the most recent deterioration. The oncol-\nogist thinks it unlikely that the chemotherapy will provide any benefit, although he cannot\ncategorically say it will not keep Mrs Hauser alive for extra hours or days. He is aware she\nhad severe nausea the last time she had this chemotherapy and there is a risk it could actually\nmake her more unwell and hasten her death, as it can be damaging to the liver.\nQuestions\n• Is this ‘futile’ treatment?\n• Is it legal or ethical to provide or even offer treatment, purely for psychological\nbenefit, rather than physical benefit?\n• Is there a difference between giving the high-energy supplements and the chemo-\ntherapy if both are purely for psychological benefit?",

She and her husband insist on proceeding, saying it matters to her to “keep fighting” for her teenage children. The oncologist doubts the treatment will meaningfully change the course of her illness.
