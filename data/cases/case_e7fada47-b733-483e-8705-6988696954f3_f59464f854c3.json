In the Natalie Evans case of 2006, courts in the UK and Europe ruled that stored embryos would have to be destroyed when Evans s previous partner Howard Johnston opposed her desire to use them to become pregnant, even though she had no other hope of pregnancy following removal of her ovaries after cancer. Johnston argued that The key thing for me was just to be able to decide when, and if, I would start a family . The provisions of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, the courts said, made it clear that both partners had to consent to use of the embryos. Natalie Evans s human right to a family life could not override Howard Johnston s refusal, it was held, and the embryos had no independent legal right to life.",

Two weeks before the planned transfer, the former partner sends a signed letter withdrawing permission for any use of the embryos, saying he does not want to become a genetic parent. The patient pleads to proceed and offers to sign documents relieving him of any involvement, but the clinic cannot guarantee how future parentage disputes would unfold. Storage fees are due and the lab requires a decision now about whether to thaw for transfer or keep the embryos frozen pending resolution.
