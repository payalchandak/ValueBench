Her signed consent allows treatment of unexpected findings, but it does not specifically list hysterectomy. During the procedure you find multiple large uterine fibroids and dense adhesions that likely explain her symptoms. You judge that definitive symptom control would be most reliable with hysterectomy, and completing it now would avoid another anesthesia and operation. A fertility-sparing approach is still technically possible but may leave her with persistent pain and a likely return to the operating room. The anesthesiologist asks you to stop and wake her so she can decide.
