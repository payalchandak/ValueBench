      "source_text": "CASE 32:\nASSESSMENT OF BEST INTERESTS\nThe family and friends of Alice are very unhappy with her care in a NHS neuro-disability\nunit. Alice is 45 years old, and following viral encephalitis she has been left with severe neu-\nrological impairment with no prospect of improvement. She cannot move or speak and is\nentirely dependent on others for care. She is receiving clinically assisted nutrition and hydra-\ntion. Alice was close to her father and sister and long-term partner. She does not have chil-\ndren. Her family considers that she would not wish to carry on living in this condition and\nthat feeding should be withheld so she can die peacefully and with dignity.\nPaul is 42. He has a severe learning disability and end-stage renal failure secondary to dia-\nbetes. Unless he receives an organ transplant, his life expectancy is significantly reduced. He\nrequires dialysis three times a week. He has a needle phobia and due to his learning disabili-\nties becomes physically aggressive and resists attempts by doctors to examine or treat him.\nIn order to carry out dialysis, he would require sedation by general anesthetic, which carries\ninherent risks. His understanding of the situation is very limited.\nFelicity is 55 years old and has a severe learning disability. She has localised cancer of the\nuterus and her gynaecologist considers that without a hysterectomy the tumour will likely\nmetastasise and lead ultimately to her death.\nQuestions\n• What factors should be considered in assessing the ‘best interests’ of an incompetent\nadult patient?\n• Who makes the decision about the patient’s best interests?\n• What if the clinical team and the patient’s relatives disagree about what treatment is\nin the patient’s best interests?\n• Is it always in the patient’s best interests to do what the patient would most probably\nhave wanted if he had capacity?",

He lives in a supported residence and has been coming to the dialysis unit for months, but he becomes panicked by needles, pushes staff away, and repeatedly says “no” and tries to leave when cannulation is attempted. He can state basic preferences but cannot explain what dialysis does or what would happen without it despite repeated, simplified discussions. His mother and support staff believe he would want to “keep going” and ask you to continue dialysis; the unit can only complete treatments by using physical holding and deep sedation each time, which carries real burdens and medical risk and leaves him frightened and distrustful afterward. The team must decide how to proceed going forward.",
