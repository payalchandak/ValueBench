      "source_text": "CASE 19:\nREQUEST FOR NON-THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT\nMichael is 8 years old. His parents have brought him to see the GP as they are concerned\nthat his ears are very prominent and stick out. They tell the GP that Michael seems very\nwithdrawn when he comes home from school, and a discussion with his teacher alerted them\nto the fact that he is being teased about his ears – he is called Dumbo and Mr Spock. Michael\nis wearing a hat throughout the consultation. His parents ask whether a referral could be\nmade so Michael could have his ears pinned back. The GP explains that this is a cosmetic\nprocedure and that it may be better to see how Michael feels about his ears when he is older.\nThe GP also informs them that as it is considered cosmetic surgery it would not be funded on\nthe NHS. Nevertheless they insist that something is done to stop Michael’s suffering.\nQuestions\n• Is it in Michael’s best interests to have a non-therapeutic procedure?\n• Should cosmetic surgery be performed on children?",

His parents report that he has become quiet and avoids activities since classmates began teasing him. He keeps a hat pulled low and speaks little in the visit. His parents say he cries before school and ask for surgery to “pin back” his ears. The GP explains that the procedure is elective and requires general anesthesia, with possible pain, scarring, infection, and dissatisfaction with the result. The parents reply that doing nothing is not working and want action before the next school term starts in six weeks, when the teasing is likely to resume. Hospital policy permits elective otoplasty in children with parental consent and the child’s assent.
