      "source_text": "Case 18-2 ee\nAmbiguous Advance Directives: Who Interprets?\nThe following case was presented to a hospital ethics committee. The\npatient, Molly Murton, is a 74-year-old female first admitted to the hospi-\ntal in June with an acute cerebral vascular accident and currently has a\ndiagnosis of “multi-infarct dementia.” She has deteriorated since her first\nadmission and is now very weak, not coherent, and has to be spoon-fed\nby the nursing staff. She swallows poorly. The patient was transferred to\nthe acute hospital because of swallowing difficulties and aspiration\npneumonia on three occasions in the past year. Two years ago, the pa-\ntient made out a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPAHC)\nnaming her daughter, Helen, as the agent but making no other comments\non the form.\nA year later, one year before the present admission, she made out\nanother DPAHC, with a skilled care facility ombudsman in attendance, in\nwhich she again named her daughter as agent but also added on the form\nthat she wanted no efforts made to prolong her life, no CPR, and no feed-\ning tubes inserted. The patient was presumably considered competent\nwhen she signed the second DPAHC. Her daughter was not in attendance\nat the time.\nSubsequently, no feeding tubes were inserted despite three admis-\nsions for aspiration pneumonia. Now that she is having severe difficulty\nwith oral nutrition, her daughter, unwilling to see her mother suffer, has\ndecided she wants a gastrostomy tube inserted to decrease the likelihood\nof aspiration. She also indicated that if her mother develops pneumonia or\nanother potential fatal complication, she does not want her transferred to\nthe acute hospital. She wants her to be given comfort care in the skilled\ncare facility. The physician fully agreed with the daughter's decision.\nHowever, the administrator of the skilled care facility was uncertain that\nit was legal or ethical for the daughter to go against her mother’s expressly\nstated wishes not to have a feeding tube inserted. The insertion of the\ntube would be for the purposes of comfort and avoidance of aspiration\npneumonia but might potentially prolong her life, which had been objected\nto by the mother.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nSince Ms. Murton specifically stated that she didn’t want a feeding tube in her\nsecond version of her advance directive, should the physician follow the\ndaughter's request?\n| What should the ethics committee say to the skilled care facility administrator\nin response to his concerns?",
