      "source_text": "pregnant through the technique of egg-donation IVF. In both instances, one could argue that as long as the risks associated with fertility treatment and pregnancy were thoroughly explained to and accepted by the woman (and her partner), then to refuse treatment on the sole ground that her health may deteriorate is unacceptably paternalistic on the part of the clinicians involved. Mrs A stated that if she had not agreed to the sterilization (which she claimed she had been placed under undue pressure to accept at the time she was diagnosed with renal failure), then she would not only have been able to, but definitely would have tried to, achieve a further pregnancy, as she did after the reversal of sterilization was performed.\nYour comparison of Lockwood and Overall has brought this chapter full circle, as have the issues of choice and vulnerability in this high-risk pregnancy. At the very start of this chapter we asked you to consider the implications of NRTs more broadly, and in particular for the women who undergo them. Lockwood’s patient Mrs A was vulnerable not only because of her clinical condition, but because of her deep desire to overcome her childlessness. Her pregnancy was clinically riskier than a normal pregnancy, but her feelings about riskiness and uncertainty mirror those experienced by both partners in the IVF context as well. New reproductive technologies have given hope to many couples, but they also create pressures and vulnerability which are not always acknowledged (Franklin and Roberts, 2006).\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 [operative at the time this case occurred, prior to the adoption of the revised law in 2008] also places great emphasis on the ‘interests of the child’ who may be born as a result of procedures such as IVF–ET. This emphasis has been interpreted by some authorities as encouraging fertility units to feel justified in refusing treatment to women with significant health problems (or to post-menopausal women) as it would, so they claim, not be in the ‘interests of the child’ to be born to a mother with reduced life expectancy due to chronic ill-health or comparatively advanced age. Apart from the obvious rejoinders that society happily countenances men becoming fathers at an age when their life expectancy is reduced, and the medical profession’s heroic efforts to assist women with serious health problems who become pregnant spontaneously, it is unquestionably in the interests of the child. After all, the child will only be born if his transplanted mother is offered fertility treatment, so that she should be offered such treatment even if he loses his mother at an early age or has to deal with the consequences of her ill-health, as otherwise he won’t exist!",

She and her partner request egg-donation IVF because she is infertile after prior tubal sterilization that she says she accepted under pressure when she started dialysis. Maternal–fetal medicine explains that pregnancy after transplant can be successful but carries a real chance of worsening kidney function, severe hypertension, preeclampsia, infection, and prematurity. Switching off mycophenolate is possible but increases rejection risk, and delaying longer may reduce fertility success. She demonstrates understanding and repeatedly states she is willing to accept these risks. The IVF clinic asks you, as her transplant physician, to provide medical clearance this week to proceed with ovarian priming and embryo transfer planning. Hospital policy and state law allow either granting or withholding clearance when pregnancy poses substantial medical risk.",
