You have been asked to visit with the hospice nurse to provide\nsupport to the patient whilst difficult decisions are discussed. You are aware that the patient\nhas recently refused to see both the gastroenterology consultant and the oncologist as she\nfeels that they were very abrupt and dismissive of her feelings when discussing completion of\na Do Not Attempt Resuscitation form. The patient is evidently distressed and angry at both\nof the professionals. You suspect that she is subconsciously pushing the professionals away as\nshe is having difficulty coming to terms with her prognosis.\nWhen you arrive the first thing Rosamund asks is how she can go about making a formal\ncomplaint about her gastroenterologist and oncologist.\nQuestions\n• How can patients make a complaint?\n• What is the most common reason for complaints occurring?\n• What should you do if a complaint is made against you?",

During recent hospital appointments, her oncologist and gastroenterologist discussed do-not-resuscitate orders in a manner she experienced as abrupt and dismissive. She has since refused further appointments with them and appears angry and distressed. You suspect her refusal to engage with these specialists may reflect difficulty accepting her prognosis rather than a fully informed choice, and that continued contact with oncology and gastroenterology could still offer meaningful symptom management and support.
