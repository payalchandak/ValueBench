      "source_text": "The case of Alison\nAs a general practitioner, you are confronted with the case of Alison, an intelligent 15-year-old girl whose father has recently tested positive for Huntington’s disease. His own mother died of the condition before Alison was born. Alison wants to know whether she, too, will develop Huntington’s disease. Her parents, who have accompanied her to the surgery, support her wish. Alison’s mother is herself contemplating genetic testing for the BRCA1 gene implicated in some breast cancers, following the death of her own mother and her elder sister from the disease.\nYou know that the clinical genetics unit which serves your patients will not test young people under 18, although Alison can have counselling. You point out that even those over 18 must undergo counselling before having the test, according to the unit’s careful protocol. Alison thinks this over and replies: ‘I can see the point of having some talks with the counsellor first. But if I do decide I want it, do I still have to wait another three years before I can actually have the test?’",

She is articulate, well-informed about the condition, and states she wants to know her status now to plan her education and life decisions accordingly. Her parents support her request. She is willing to undergo counseling but asks why she must wait until age 18 to proceed with testing if she remains determined after counseling. The institutional genetics protocol prohibits predictive testing for asymptomatic minors under 18, citing concerns about psychological harm, the irrevocable nature of the information, and the inability of adolescents to fully anticipate the long-term emotional and social consequences of a positive result. However, the patient argues convincingly that the uncertainty itself is harmful, that waiting will not change her risk, and that she has the capacity to understand the implications. As her physician, you must decide whether to advocate for an exception to the protocol or uphold the age restriction.",
