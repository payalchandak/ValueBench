        "vignette": "An 87-year-old woman with severe dementia and multiple comorbidities is admitted to the ICU with septic shock from a urinary source. She has required escalating vasopressor support and mechanical ventilation. Her family, who have been devoted caregivers, request that \"everything be done,\" and the intensivist believes that with continued aggressive ICU care—including possible renal replacement therapy if her acute kidney injury progresses—she has a reasonable chance of surviving this acute episode and returning to her baseline functional state at the nursing facility. However, the ICU is operating at full capacity during a seasonal surge of critically ill patients. Continuing her intensive care will require keeping her in one of the ICU's specialized beds for an estimated additional 7-10 days, during which multiple other patients with serious acute conditions—including younger patients with reversible illnesses—will need to be managed in step-down units or have their elective surgeries postponed. You are the attending intensivist and must decide whether to continue full ICU-level care for this patient or transition her to comfort-focused measures to free the bed for other patients.",
