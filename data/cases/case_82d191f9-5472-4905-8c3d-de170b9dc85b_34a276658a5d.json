A 32 year old woman was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care\nUnit following a motor vehicle accident; she had multiple injuries\nand fractures, with several complications which continued to develop\nover the first couple of weeks. The patient rapidly developed Adult\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome, was on a ventilator, and was\ncontinuously sedated. Shortly after the patient's admission, her\nparents were contacted and remained vigilant at her bedside. The\nparents reported that the patient was one month away from having\nher divorce finalized. The patient's husband was reportedly\nphysically and emotionally abusive to her throughout their five years\nof marriage. The parents had not notified this man of the patient's\nhospitalization, and reported that visit by him would be distressing\nto the patient if she were aware of it. The patient's soon to be ex-\nhusband is her legal next of kin.\nShould the husband be responsible for treatment decisions which the\npatient cannot make?\na. No, because there is an implied consent by law for provision of \"emergency\"\nmedical treatment in such cases.\nb. Yes because there is a divorce proceeding.\nc. Yes because the law sets an explicit time limitation on implied consent based\non an \"emergency.\"\nd. Yes because the father is the surrogate decision-makers for the patient.",

        "vignette": "A 32-year-old woman is in the trauma ICU after a motor vehicle crash. She has been intubated for several days. She remains unable to follow commands when sedation is lightened. The team anticipates prolonged ventilatory support. By tomorrow, they must decide whether to proceed with tracheostomy and feeding tube placement or continue endotracheal ventilation for a short, time-limited period and reassess. Both options are medically reasonable but differ in invasiveness and long-term burden. She has no advance directive and no documented proxy. Her husband is reachable and requests to serve as surrogate. He says he knows her preferences from prior hospitalizations. Her parents report a recent separation and alleged intimate partner violence. A prior emergency visit note documents suspected IPV involving the husband. The parents report she previously told them she would want them, not her husband, to make decisions if she lacked capacity. The IPV concern raises safety and coercion risks if the husband controls consent and access. Hospital policy prioritizes a spouse but allows an alternate-surrogate process when there is credible concern about appropriateness. The hospital has applied this process inconsistently in IPV-suspected cases, raising fairness concerns. Counsel confirms either route is legally permissible. A court-appointed guardian cannot be obtained in time, and the ICU requires one surrogate to consent now.",
