      "source_text": "CASE 47:\nWHEN TO SECTION A PATIENT UNDER THE MENTAL\nHEALTH ACT\nKate is 27 and lives at home with her parents and younger brother. She studied a nthropology\nat university and had been in a long-term relationship. After leaving university with a good\ndegree, she struggled to get a job. She eventually found work in a restaurant, which she\nseemed to enjoy. Last year her boyfriend moved out and she decided to quit her job and move\nback home. Over the past year her family has become increasingly worried about her health\nand behaviour. Her personal care has deteriorated and she has slowly withdrawn from inter-\nacting with her family. She has not bothered to find a job locally and only leaves her bedroom\nto wash and get food from the kitchen. Kate has also begun to clean her hands obsessively\nalthough otherwise she does not seem to wash. Her room smells stale and she has refused to\nlet her mum change her bedding. She does not seem to change her clothes and does not allow\nthem to be washed with the family clothes. Her mother has noticed that Kate’s hands are raw\nand that she has sores on her back and her legs. She refused to speak to a GP about her mood,\nand in desperation Kate’s parents have spoken to their GP about what can be done. The GP\nwas concerned enough to attempt a home visit, but on arrival Kate refused to come out of her\nroom, saying that she was just having a break from the stresses of living.\nQuestions\n• Could Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n• Should Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?",

She rarely changes clothes and refuses to let anyone wash her bedding. She washes her hands repetitively and they are cracked and bleeding. Her mother has noticed sores on her back and legs. She has stopped working and will not attend appointments. During a home visit, she will not open the door and speaks through it. She says she is “fine” and does not want help. She denies suicidal intent, but her family reports she is eating little and appears confused at times. The clinician worries about untreated psychosis or severe depression with self-neglect.
