      "source_text": "The Benefits and Harms of High-Risk Chemotherapy\nJoe Cavanaugh, a 58-year-old professor of economics, was diagnosed\nwith chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) several months ago. Though\nthis particular type of leukemia is somewhat less responsive to chemo-\ntherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh responded well to a course of chemotherapy\nthat he took orally shortly after his diagnosis. Dr. Cavanaugh’s last blood\ncount indicated that his white blood count was greatly reduced. During\nthe course of his chemotherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh had become close to\nHeather Eyberg, Pharm.D., the clinical pharmacist in the cancer treat-\nment center.\nAfter a follow-up visit with the oncologist, Dr. Cavanaugh stopped by\nDr. Eyberg’s office. Dr. Cavanaugh said, “The doctor has suggested several\npossibilities regarding my treatment. I trust you, and I would appreciate\nyour opinion on my options. The doctor said that now that I have finished\ntaking the oral chemotherapy, I could start interferon alpha or, if I want to\nbe “cured,” I should think about a stem cell transplant. The type of leuke-\nmia I have can rapidly change from this chronic phase into acute leukemia.\nIf that happens, it is unlikely that anything would help, and I would not\nhave long to live. The doctor wants me to think about a stem cell transplant.\nHe said I could remain in this holding pattern for years, but there is no\nway of knowing. Or I could have high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell\ntransplant. What do you think?”\nDr. Eyberg respects Dr. Cavanaugh and his capacity to understand the\nrisks and benefits involved in stem cell transplantation. She knows that al-\nlogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only therapy\nproven to cure CML. If Dr. Cavanaugh has a sibling that is a match and has\nthe HSCT within the first year of his diagnosis, he has a better five-year\nsurvival rate than those who undergo HSCT after the first year of diagnosis.\nSo time is of the essence. The two options presented to Dr. Cavanaugh are\nessentially: watch, wait, take the interferon alpha and hope that the disease\nnever progresses or take a chance on HSCT now. The risks of HSCT are sub-\nstantial. The possibility of infection and other complications is very high.\nIt is not inconceivable that Dr. Cavanaugh could die from the HSCT itself.\nSince Dr. Eyberg is part of the cancer treatment team, she is unsure of\nwhere her moral commitment should lie. Should she counsel Dr. Cavanaugh\nto choose the least harmful course of therapy? The conservative route would\nprobably be to watch and wait and take the interferon alpha. Yet, if the\ndisease progresses to acute leukemia, there is little anyone could do to\nhelp Dr. Cavanaugh. However, Dr. Cavanaugh could be in the percentage\nof patients who never progress to this fatal phase of the disease. Even if he\neventually did change to the fatal phase, Dr. Cavanaugh might have many\ngood years with his wife and children until then.\n_ Dr. Eyberg could also counsel Dr. Cavanaugh to choose that option\nthat maximizes the benefit for him. It is hard in this situation to determine\nwhich course of action will do the most good in the long run. Clearly, HSCT\nholds greater risk in the short run but offers the potential for a cure of\nDr. Cavanaugh’s leukemia in the long run.\nFinally, Dr. Eyberg is troubled by the memory of another patient witha\nsimilar diagnosis who recently chose the option of HSCT and did not sur-\nvive the procedure. Given all of these considerations, Dr. Eyberg is not\nsure where to begin.",

        "vignette": "A 58-year-old man with chronic myelogenous leukemia has completed his initial oral chemotherapy with good response. His oncologist has offered him two treatment paths: begin interferon therapy with close monitoring, or proceed to allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The interferon approach carries minimal immediate risk and could maintain his remission for years, though the disease may eventually transform into an aggressive acute phase that is usually fatal. The transplant offers the only potential cure for his leukemia, but carries substantial procedural risk including serious infection, graft-versus-host disease, and possible death from the treatment itself. Because outcomes are better when transplantation is performed within the first year of diagnosis, delaying the decision may foreclose the curative option. The patient has asked his clinical pharmacist, whom he trusts, for guidance on which path to choose. As you consider your recommendation, you must weigh the immediate danger of an aggressive intervention against the possibility of cure, versus the safety of a conservative approach that preserves quality of life now but may allow progression to a lethal disease phase.",
