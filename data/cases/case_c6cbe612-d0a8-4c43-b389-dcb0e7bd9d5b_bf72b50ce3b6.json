You review that her past flares caused rapid loss of hand function and that uncontrolled inflammation can leave lasting damage even if symptoms later improve.

        "vignette": "A 44-year-old woman with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis has had sustained low disease activity for several years on infliximab and low-dose prednisone. Today she has no active synovitis, and recent ESR and CRP have been low. She reports recurrent sinus infections since starting biologic therapy and is worried about immunosuppression after a friend’s hospitalization. She asks to stop infliximab and try acupuncture alone for the next few months. She says she is leaning that way but would continue the infusion if you strongly advise it. In the past, even brief gaps in biologic therapy were followed by flares that limited hand function for months, and regaining control required higher steroid doses. She has already failed or could not tolerate nonbiologic DMARD options, and switching biologics would require a new authorization process. Her next infusion is this week. The infusion center has limited slots, and a last-minute cancellation may mean another patient cannot be treated this week. If the infusion is missed, the insurer requires full re-authorization, which uses staff time and can delay care for other patients.",
