      "source_text": "This scenario concerns Henry, a 73-year-old man who was diagnosed with depression and then with atypical Alzheimer’s disease. But Henry’s symptoms were still not fully explained, and his dementia was now so severe that communication with him was effectively impossible. The family history, however, included members who had manifested jerky movements or dementia late in life. This suggested a possible genetic link. In conversation with a researcher from a project on memory and ageing, the general practitioner involved in Henry’s care learned that a new testing procedure could determine accurately whether Henry might have Huntington’s disease (HD), an incurable progressive disease of the central nervous system. The testing procedure, based on the number of repeats of the gene for HD, would only be available if Henry was enrolled on the research project. (This is no longer the case as far as HD is concerned, but it may well apply for other conditions.) Henry’s clinical team decided to request consent from his family to use the newly available genetic test and to enrol him in the research project. The family agreed, and Henry tested positive for Huntington’s disease 10 days before his death. But it turned out that Henry’s family hadn’t really understood the implications for themselves of allowing him to be tested. Huntington’s is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that Henry’s children – Ann and Peter would have roughly 50 50 chances of developing the condition themselves. Henry’s wife Mary now wanted everyone in the family to be tested for HD, including her grandchildren (who would have a 1 in 4 chance of developing HD). Ann was willing to be tested herself, but Peter was adamantly against finding out his genetic status or allowing his wife Ruth to learn about Henry’s test results, even though he and his wife already had two young children, and might have more.",

He carries a prior diagnosis of atypical Alzheimer’s disease, but his neurologist suspects Huntington’s disease because of late-life choreiform movements and a strong family history of similar symptoms. A confirmatory genetic test is only available through enrollment in a memory-disorders research registry that is closing to new participants soon. The result is unlikely to change his short-term medical treatment, but it would clarify prognosis, guide end-of-life planning, and would have major implications for his adult children and grandchildren. His wife, as surrogate, wants the test done. One son has told the team he does not want any genetic information and does not want his household informed.

        "vignette": "A 73-year-old man with rapidly progressive dementia is admitted for agitation and dysphagia. He cannot communicate and lacks decision-making capacity. He was labeled as having atypical Alzheimer’s disease, but neurology now suspects Huntington’s disease because of new choreiform movements and a family pattern of similar late-life decline. He left no written directive about genetic testing. He previously sought diagnostic answers but also said he did not want genetic information to burden his children. A confirmatory HTT CAG-repeat test is available only through same-day enrollment in a hospital registry using a CLIA-certified lab; insurance denied standard testing, and enrollment closes after discharge. Enrollment includes long-term storage and broad sharing of de-identified data, and results will be placed in the EHR. Blood draw would likely require temporary sedation or restraints, with near-term risk of aspiration or hypotension. The wife, his legal surrogate, requests testing. One adult son asks not to receive predictive genetic information, though a result would indirectly reveal his risk. The HTT result is unlikely to change tomorrow’s feeding-tube or discharge decisions.",
