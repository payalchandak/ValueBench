A court-appointed guardian makes medical decisions. He is diagnosed with aggressive leukemia that is not curable. The oncology team can offer induction chemotherapy. It would require prolonged hospitalization, repeated blood draws, restraints at times for line safety, and could cause severe infections, bleeding, and distress. It might also shorten his life if complications occur. Without chemotherapy, the focus would shift to transfusions as needed and symptom-focused care, with an expected steady decline.
