      "source_text": "Illness, pain, su ering and the value of life\nRon Berghmans\nIntroduction\nEthical issues related to end-of-life care concern phil-\nosophical questions about the goal(s) of medicine,\nand the place of pain, su ering and the value and\nmeaning of life of the patient. The story of my illness\nexperience and recovery as a cancer patient, on which\nthe following is based, contains three parts: the rst\nencompasses the period from complaint to nal diag-\nnosis (October 2003 July 2004); the second the\nperiod of treatment, recovery, relapse, and repeated\nand more intensive treatment and recovery (July\n2004 April 2006). The third is the one from de nite\nrecovery until the present time. In that period I suf-\nfered a stroke from which I recovered quickly and\nwith only slight residual e ects.\n\nMy personal story of illness, pain and su ering\nand the corresponding experience of life s meaning\nand value started in the autumn of 2003. At that time\nthe chronic back pain which I experienced in the\nlower parts of my back was increasing. As this was\ndi erent from normal I had been used to chronic\nback pain for a great part of my life late in October I\nturned to my general practitioner. She diagnosed the\nback pain as functional and non-speci c and pre-\nscribed pain-killers. Her advice was not to work too\nhard . . . As the pain kept increasing, after a few weeks I\nreturned to the general practitioner. Now she pre-\nscribed di erent pain killers which had as little e ect\nas the previous ones. As my condition worsened, I had\na third consultation during which I expressed my wish\nto have X-rays of my back. Only very reluctantly and\nafter much pressure did my GP agree to refer me to a\nradiologist in the academic hospital. X-rays of my\nlower back showed no real and serious anomalies,\nalthough there was some minor pathology at the\nvertebrae. It appeared that my GP was content to\nsee these particularities as the possible (probable)\ncauses of my pain. Nevertheless, my situation kept\nworsening as there was no therapy available to better\nmy condition.\n\nAfter consultations with di erent other medical\nprofessionals, nally it was July 2004, so more than\nhalf a year after the rst consultation with the GP an\nassistant neurosurgeon decided to scan the whole of\nmy back with MRI. On the basis of this scan it\nappeared that there was a process to be seen halfway\ndown my spinal cord. After taking a biopsy it was\nconcluded that I su ered from malignant B-cell non-\nHodgkin lymphoma and that it was localized in the\nabdomen and the bone marrow. This last detail\nexplained the seriousness of the pain I su ered.\n\nThe shock of a fatal diagnosis It is often said that a\ncancer diagnosis is experienced as a death sentence\nby the people involved. The patient s life is at stake,\nand although therapeutic prospects in many cancers\nhave improved particularly in the case of non-\nHodgkin lymphoma for most people the prospect\nof premature death will be the rst thought when a\ncancer diagnosis is communicated. The knowledge of\na cancer diagnosis implies that the patient and his\nfamily and friends need to relate to this new and\nmostly unexpected fact. One cannot escape the\nneed to give a place to the illness and the future\nprospects regarding treatment (if applicable) and pre-\nmature death.\n\nBecoming aware of the real signi cance and poten-\ntial impact of the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\ncertainly was not something which happened immedi-\nately after it became clear that there was something\nseriously wrong in my body. Additional diagnostic\nprocedures were in some way a distraction from what\nreally was the case, as if as such these procedures\nalready improved my future prospects. So the shock\nof a fatal diagnosis was not really a shock, but some-\nthing which evolved in the diagnostic process and\nduring treatment. In my opinion this phenomenon\na ects bioethical and legal notions of informed consent\nand refusal of treatment, as these notions are tightly\nconnected to communicative aspects during the\nillness course, as well as psychological, social and cul-\ntural factors which relate to defence mechanisms,\ndistortion of information, and cultural habits and\nvalues.\n\nHope Some claim that hope is the crucial factor in\nthe care for patients with cancer. Hope involves the\nprospect that in the future there will be a cure, or at\nleast a prospect of a life with an acceptable quality for\nthe patient. During the di erent treatments I have\nundergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and\nautologous stem-cell transplantation I have experi-\nenced a lot of support from the idea that at the end of\nthe tunnel there would be the light of a successful\ntreatment, even though I was aware that this chance\nwas real, but de nitely not a guarantee. Above that I\ngranted myself the outlook that I would have the luck\nto belong to the statistical group of patients who\nwould survive the lymphoma (about 50% of all su er-\ners). This promoted ghting spirit and gave strength\nduring di cult times.\n\nIsolation In a case of severe illness (together with\nburdensome medical treatments like chemotherapy\nand radiation) the patient becomes more and more\ninvolved with and focused on the illness and the\ntreatments. In my case, the experience of intense\nand enduring pain isolates the person from his\nsurroundings. The physical environment has little\nor no meaning and personal contact becomes di -\ncult, as the person is almost exclusively involved\nwith and focused on the pain he experiences. This\nintroversion increases the vulnerability of the\npatient who has di culty in expressing his or her\nneeds and wishes; this implies a need for carers to\nbe sensitive to the unexpressed needs the patient\nmay have. An illustration in my experience was the\npressure sores on my back, which went undetected\nfor some time.\n\nContemplating wishes in advance As it became clear\nthat my illness might progress in such a way that my\nlife would end during or after treatment, I decided\nthat it would be helpful to draft an advance directive\nstating my medical wishes in case I became uncon-\nscious or otherwise incompetent. When drafting the\nadvance directive together with my wife, we discov-\nered that it was not easy to formulate in an exact and\nunambiguous way my wishes regarding end-of-life\ntreatment and care. It was particularly hard to delin-\neate care which would be acceptable, and care which\nwould not be acceptable. In drafting an advance\ndirective, one rst needs to be conscious of the values\nwhich lie at the basis of your concerns about care at\nthe end of life. On the basis of these values it becomes\npossible to give practical guidance to carers and rel-\natives. In any case, I learned that debating my wishes\nwith my wife gave me the con dence that in case I\nbecame incompetent and decisions ought to be\nmade, then my wife would be in a good position to\nact as my representative on the basis of my personal\nvalues and wishes. It seems to me that the involve-\nment of a person who is close to the patient can\nprovide much better and more valuable input into\nthe process of medical (and ethical) decision-making\nat the end of life than any formal advance document.\nAt the same time I am aware that this is the ideal case\nin which there is a formal advance directive together\nwith a person who has knowledge of the concerns\nand wishes of the patient.\n\nHopelessness My experience with severe pain is\nlargely connected to the pre-diagnosis period\n(October 2003 July 2004). Central in this period was\nthe continuous back pain which coloured my exis-\ntence and that of my family and friends.\nAs the pain became unbearable, the rehabilita-\ntion physician who was in charge of my physical\ncondition would give an injection with corticoste-\nroids. The e ects were really miraculous. The rst\ntime, within two hours the pain was completely\ngone and kept away for six weeks. This gave me\nand my family the opportunity to spend ten happy\ndays in Tuscany. However, each subsequent injection\nhad less e ect, and after 4 or 5 injections the pain\nonly stayed away for less than 24 hours. The rehabil-\nitation physician discussed the issue and explained\nthat he thought it was useless to continue the use of\ncorticosteroids. I could not do other than agree, there\nwas no choice.\nLess than a week later as my condition kept\ngrowing worse the situation became unbearable.\nThe pain was continuously intense and I saw no pros-\npect of relief whatsoever. As there was no use in\nadministering corticosteroids, I contemplated suicide\nas an escape from this terrible lot. After a sleepless\nnight I remember it was early on a Saturday morn-\ning I called the rehabilitation physician. In my mind, I\nhad made the decision that if he was not willing to\ninject me once more with corticosteroids, I would\njump from the local bridge into the river.\n\nConfusion and broken communication Next to the\npain during the pre-diagnosis period, there was the\npain which accompanied the medical procedures\nparticularly the intensive chemotherapy which was\nfollowed by autologous stem-cell transplantation I\nreceived morphine by injection. This pain-killer was\ncontinuously infused by a syringe driver, and brie y\nafter the start of this I became seriously confused. This\nconfusion encompassed di erent experiences.\nThe rst experience was one of hallucinations:\npartly visual, and partly what I would call experiential.\nThe visual experience involved distortions of visual\nperception: when I looked out of the hospital window,\nI saw dancing construction cranes.\nThe second experience involved what may be\ncalled broken communication . This was very fright-\nening. As I had di culty expressing myself, I was\nunable to clarify my wishes, but particularly my con-\ncerns to others. An example was my conviction that\ntime had been xed.\nThe third experience involved unclearness about\nplace and time. Particularly at night I was disturbed\nabout my environment. I didn t exactly know where I\nwas, and why I was where I was staying. Besides that, I\ndidn t know the time or date, let s say the coordinates\nof my existence in time. As already mentioned, there\nwas a period in which I experienced time as being\nxed, which was particularly troublesome as I thought\nthat this eternal xation of time would imply that I\nwould have to stay in the hospital without end. This\nwas extremely frightening as I was eager to leave\nhospital as quickly as possible.\nIn particular, the experience of broken communi-\ncation was frightening because I could not get my\nworries and fears across to the people who were\ncaring for me: nurses and doctors. Only my wife was\nsensitive enough and able to see that my mental\ncondition was worrisome. Her intervention led to a\nreduction of the morphine dose, which resulted in a\npassing of the side e ects.\n\nUnbearable su ering The notion of unbearable suf-\nfering is di cult to assess. In a recent publication,\nmotivations of patients with a request for euthanasia\nor physician-assisted suicide were explored on the\nbasis of 10 patient-centred, qualitative studies (Dees\net al., 2009). This exploration showed that patients\nexpress their unbearable and unrelieved su ering in\nterms of pain, weakness, functional impairment,\ndependency, being a burden, hopelessness, indignity,\nintellectual deterioration, perception of loss of one-\nself, loss of autonomy, and being tired of life.\n‘\nThe authors of this article conclude that the point\nwhere su ering becomes unbearable is a very indi-\nvidual perception that is closely related to the person-\nality, the life history, social factors, and existential\nmotivations. Irreversible disintegration and humilia-\ntion of the person appeared to be the start of openly\nexploring the phenomenology of death. The circum-\nstances of their illness brought all the patients to the\npoint where they would rather die than continue to\nlive under the conditions imposed by their illness.\nThe unbearableness of su ering can be explored\nfrom two positions: the viewpoint and experience of\nthe su ering person, and the viewpo\n...[TRUNCATED]",
