      "source_text": "Case 4-5\nIntentional Exposure of Unknowing Sexual Partners to HIV\nIn 1997 Nushawn J. Williams was 20 years old. He was publicly identified\nby name as a drug dealer who in upstate New York and New York City had\nintentionally had unprotected sexual relations with as many as three hun-\ndred women and adolescent girls, one as young as thirteen years of age.\nAt least thirteen of them had since been found infected with human.\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mr. Williams had learned of his HIV status\nthe previous September while in Chautauqua County jail on a charge of\nstealing a car. He continued to be sexually active after being told by a\npublic health nurse of his HIV status.\nMr. Williams kept a list of his sexual partners. Thus, it would be possi-\nble to identify them, contact them, and offer testing. In the case of pregnan-\ncies, treatment could be provided, lowering the probability that the newborns\nwould acquire the infection. Mr. Williams, who claimed he suffered from\nschizophrenia, had many contacts with health professionals while in jail\nafter being prosecuted by Chautauqua Country District Attorney James\nSubjack. Although it has never been made public whether the diagnosis of\nschizophrenia has been confirmed, his claim provides a reason why his con-\ntacts with health professionals were so extensive.\nTraditionally, health professionals owe a strict duty of confidentiality to\ntheir patients or clients. The World Medical Association's Declaration of\nGeneva states bluntly, “I will respect the secrets that are confided in me.\" It\nalso states that “the health of my patient will be my first consideration.\"\nOther traditional codes require that the health professional remain\ndedicated to the welfare of the patient. In this case, however, the health\nprofessional who learns of Mr. Williams's aggressive and dangerous be-\nhavior would be aware that his sexual partners are at serious risk from his\nactivity. Moreover, should they become pregnant, their children could re-\nceive life-saving benefit if the women are informed, diagnosed, and treated.\nTheir future sexual partners also have a direct interest in learning of their\nsituation. It is plausible that Mr. Williams has a legal, financial, and psy-\nchological interest in not letting this information be passed to the women\nhe has exposed. If a health professional becomes aware of Mr. Williams's\nbehavior and knows he has a list of the women he has exposed, is that pro-\nfessional's duty exclusively to serve the patient's interest, or must he or she\nin determining the moral duty also take into account the interests of the\nwomen and those associated with them?",

He keeps a written list with names and contact information. He refuses to share the list or allow anyone to contact them. He says disclosure would “ruin his life” and he will stop coming to care if you report him. He also mentions one partner who may be pregnant.

        "vignette": "A 20-year-old man is seen in an HIV clinic after a new positive test done in jail. He feels well and has decision-making capacity. He agrees to same-day rapid-start ART and wants to become undetectable. He reports recent condomless sex with multiple partners, sometimes during substance use. He is not willing to commit to condoms or abstinence. He brought a handwritten contact list to help remember partners’ names. He allows you to verify spellings, but he refuses any assisted or mediated partner notification. He fears serious personal consequences, including losing housing and possible retaliation, if partners are approached and the disclosure is traced back to him. He is scheduled for release tomorrow and plans to leave the area with no reliable phone. ART will reduce transmission risk, but viral suppression takes time. Partners could have ongoing exposure before suppression. HIV case reporting is complete. Counsel confirms either approach is legally permissible. The health department can only begin outreach if you send the contacts today.",
