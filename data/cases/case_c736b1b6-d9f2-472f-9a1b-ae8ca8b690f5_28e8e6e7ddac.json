Work through the\nscenario and associated questions, which will\ntake you about 40 minutes, and then return to\nthe text.\nWe have begun with a case taken from a real-life\ninstance, aimed at illustrating the difficulties patients\nmay encounter when deciding whether to give their\ninformed consent to participate in a research trial.\nThis scenario concerns Jan, whose attention is caught\nby a newspaper advertisement requesting people\nwilling to participate in a drug trial for a syndrome\n‘ ’\ncalled generalized anxiety disorder. It is based on an\nactual case from Finland, which seems particularly\nappropriate as the birthplace of the Helsinki\nDeclaration.\nThis scenario concentrates on ve key issues regar-\nfi\nding the patient’s perspective on medical research:\n* Informed consent and criteria for determining\nresearch subjects’ understanding of the risks and\npurposes of the trial;\n* Placebo use in randomized clinical trials, the gold\nstandard of evidence-based medicine;\n* Risk and adverse consequences of both\nparticipation and non-participation in clinical\ntrials;\n* The medicalization of ordinary life, epitomized\nin this scenario by the dubious syndrome being\nstudied in the trial, ‘generalized anxiety\ndisorder’;\n* The doctor–patient relationship in medical\nresearch and how it may conflict with that\nrelationship in the clinical setting. In clinical\nmedicine the patient’s best interest is the doctor’s\npriority, but the research subject is not actually a\npatient and may derive no therapeutic bene t\nfi\nfrom the trial. Indeed, in Phase I trials, where\nthe objective is to study potential side e ects\nff\nof the treatment, the participant runs the\nfi\nrisk of harm rather than bene t. Those subjects\nfi\nassigned to the placebo arm of a clinical trial\nfi\nwill receive no clinical bene ts except\n–\n’\npossibly psychosomatic ones another issue in\nJan s case.",

She recently responded partly to therapy and low-dose SSRI but is frustrated with side effects. She brings a newspaper ad for a local randomized drug trial for “generalized anxiety disorder.” The study includes a placebo arm and requires tapering her current SSRI for several weeks. She says she wants to enroll today and asks you to sign the treating-physician form confirming she is medically eligible. In conversation, she repeatedly describes the study medication as “the new treatment I’ll be getting,” and she dismisses the possibility of placebo or symptom rebound, even after you review the consent summary. The research team’s enrollment closes this week. The IRB-approved protocol and hospital policy allow you either to sign eligibility or to decline and recommend standard clinical care instead.",
