You have been asked to visit with the hospice nurse to provide\nsupport to the patient whilst difficult decisions are discussed. You are aware that the patient\nhas recently refused to see both the gastroenterology consultant and the oncologist as she\nfeels that they were very abrupt and dismissive of her feelings when discussing completion of\na Do Not Attempt Resuscitation form. The patient is evidently distressed and angry at both\nof the professionals. You suspect that she is subconsciously pushing the professionals away as\nshe is having difficulty coming to terms with her prognosis.\nWhen you arrive the first thing Rosamund asks is how she can go about making a formal\ncomplaint about her gastroenterologist and oncologist.\nQuestions\n• How can patients make a complaint?\n• What is the most common reason for complaints occurring?\n• What should you do if a complaint is made against you?",

Over the past week she has become weaker and more somnolent from rising bilirubin and escalating opioids.

She recently refused further visits from her gastroenterologist and oncologist after a blunt discussion about a resuscitation form. Today she is angry and asks you to help her file a formal complaint. No out-of-hospital DNR form is in the home. Her daughter is present and says the patient previously told the family she would not want CPR, but the patient now refuses to discuss code status and says, “Just leave me alone about that.” The nurse worries she may lose the ability to decide within days.

        "vignette": "You are covering a home hospice patient with advanced metastatic pancreatic cancer. She is weaker and more somnolent from cholestasis and escalating opioids. She is lucid only in brief stretches. In those moments she states she is dying at home and would not want CPR, but she cannot sustain attention to weigh complex choices. After earlier resuscitation discussions, she declined further clinician visits. Today she asks for help filing a complaint. No out-of-hospital DNR/POLST is in the home, and EMS has been called twice this week for dyspnea; crews note repeated full-code responses divert resources. If she remains full code, the next episode will likely lead to nonbeneficial CPR/intubation and hospital transfer. If code status is raised again today, she has threatened to revoke hospice and refuse opioids. Her daughter is the legal surrogate and recalls no-CPR wishes, but an adult son recently told staff she wanted everything. State law and hospice policy permit leaving default full code or completing a surrogate-signed DNR/POLST after a good-faith finding of incapacity.",
