Despite a portable DNAR (do-not-attempt-\nresuscitation) form signed by his daughter, who was his legally authorized\ndecision-maker, Mr. Bumgartner received cardiopulmonary resuscitation\nin the emergency room. He was then admitted to the intensive care unit. The\nprimary care physician and consultant neurologist authorized extubation\nand removal of the respirator but then declined to insist on this because\nDennis Havens, the consultant pulmonologist, insisted that Mr. Bumgartner\nwas not “brain dead.” Without any change in his condition, Mr. Bumgartner\ndied three days later.\nHorton Pickering was the case reviewer for the insurance company,\nwhich was part of an HMO system. He refused to pay the costs for the three\ndays of “extended care” because of the valid DNAR on the chart. Mr. Pickering\nclaimed that the patient should not have been admitted to intensive care\nand that overuse of facilities and services were not the responsibility of\nthe HMO.",

He is unresponsive, on a ventilator, and not expected to regain the ability to make decisions; he is not declared dead by neurologic criteria. His daughter is his legally authorized surrogate and presents a signed out-of-hospital form stating he did not want resuscitation or continued life support if he could not meaningfully recover. In the chart, however, there is an older clinic note describing him as “wanting everything done,” and the daughter says he sometimes spoke differently depending on who was present. The team is divided: some feel continuing ventilation risks prolonging suffering without benefit, while others worry that withdrawing now could end his life based on an uncertain interpretation of his wishes. You must decide what to recommend today.",

By ICU day 1 he remains ventilator-dependent on high settings and requires norepinephrine.

She describes multiple conversations over the past year in which he said, “If I’m on machines and can’t get back to living on my own, don’t keep me alive—let me go,” and that he specifically feared “ending up in a nursing home on a ventilator.” She requests a transition to comfort-focused care and palliative extubation, understanding this will likely lead to death within hours to a day.\n\nThe team also finds a primary-care clinic note from a routine visit 2 months ago (when he was stable and not discussing a serious-illness scenario) stating: “Goals of care: patient wants everything done.” There is no formal advance directive or POLST on file.
