The oncology team recommends combination chemotherapy with curative intent. She can clearly describe her diagnosis, the goals of treatment, and that declining therapy is expected to shorten her life. She says she does not want chemotherapy and asks to go home, explaining that she fears losing the ability to care for her partner during treatment and wants to prioritize feeling well for the time she has. She is calm, consistent, and shows no signs of delirium, intoxication, or depression. Her family is pleading with the team to “do something.” The team believes treatment should start within the next day or two while her organ function is still stable enough to tolerate it.

        "vignette": "A 48-year-old woman is hospitalized with stage III non-Hodgkin lymphoma and cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Oncology recommends combination chemotherapy that offers a meaningful chance of long-term remission. Treatment requires a central line and close monitoring for toxicity. She says she wants to leave today and decline disease-directed treatment because she wants to stay well enough to care for her partner. Overnight, nursing staff documented periods of inattention and disorientation. Her calcium is elevated and is being treated. She started high-dose corticosteroids for airway symptoms, and her insomnia has worsened. She can repeat key facts but gives shifting explanations of how she will manage at home. She has alternated between wanting treatment and refusing it. If she leaves now, hospice and home supports cannot be arranged until after the weekend. Discharge today carries a high risk of sudden airway compromise or venous obstruction within 24–48 hours without inpatient monitoring. A brief medical hold for formal capacity evaluation may require security involvement, restraints, or sedating medications, increasing risk of trauma or falls. Hospital policy and state law allow either discharge after bedside assessment or a brief medical hold, but a decision is needed within hours.",
