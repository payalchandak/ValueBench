      "source_text": "Case 9-6\nAssisted Suicide, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Depression\nKathleen Rheel was a 56-year-old, married, former schoolteacher in the\nOregon public schools who had retired from teaching five years previously\nbecause the daily grind had become too much for her. She had two years\nbefore been diagnosed by Michael Carver, her internist, as showing the\ninitial signs of Alzheimer's disease. She and her husband had never had\nchildren. She believed her friends had not realized her situation, but she\nhad noticed an increasing inability to remember names, and her husband\ndetected that she was forgetting birthdays and appointments. She feared\nher symptoms were getting worse. She and her husband had discussed a\nplan to hire a housekeeper, anticipating the time when she would not be\nable to be left by herself. She had become increasingly distressed at these\nprospects. She had always been a lover of knowledge. She read constantly, and she and her\nhusband enjoyed attending adult education classes and local theater. She\nhated the thought of a life without these basic pleasures. Her life was grad-\nually becoming unbearable.\nMs. Rheel was horrified at the prospect of a gradual decline in her\nmental abilities and the economic impact on her husband if she would\nneed care for a prolonged period. She explored the prognosis with\nDr. Carver, who indicated that he thought the disease was progressing but\nthat she would be quite capable of managing her own affairs and enjoying\nlife for some years to come.\nDuring one of her appointments with Dr. Carver, she asked about the\nterms of the Oregon law that permits physicians to assist in the suicide of\nterminally ill patients. Dr. Carver was reluctant to discuss it. He had origi-\nnally been opposed to the law, believing that the physician’s task is to pro-\nmote health rather than cause the deaths of patients. Gradually, however,\nhe had become convinced that some patients suffered terribly in spite of\nreceiving the best medical care available. He believed in hospice care but\nrealized that some patients, such as Ms. Rheel, were not candidates. Her\nsuffering was not physical. Even high-quality psychiatric and social work\ncare were not going to address her increasing misery.\nDr. Carver knew that the Oregon assisted suicide law applied only to\npatients who were 18 years of age, capable of making and communicating\ntheir own health care decisions, and had a terminal illness that would lead\nto death within six months. He explained that Ms. Rheel would not qualify\nsince, although the Alzheimer's disease would likely eventually be related\nto her death, she did not have a terminal illness that would lead to death\nwithin six months.\nOver the course of the next year, Ms. Rheel’s condition worsened some-\nwhat. Her depression became more pronounced, although in Dr. Carver's\nopinion she was clearly still mentally competent. At an appointment with\nDr. Carver, she pressed more aggressively. She informed him that she had\ndecided that she did not want to live with her deteriorating condition. She\nand her husband had made all arrangements; her will had been reviewed,\nshe had begun giving some of her possessions to friends and relatives, and\nshe was now serious about discussing Dr. Carver's assistance. Dr. Carver\nstrongly urged her to accept a referral to a psychiatrist, but she declined.\nThis continued for three additional appointments. It was clear to\nDr. Carver that she was increasingly committed to ending her life. She had\nclearly thought through the decision carefully and would likely choose\nnonmedical means if he did not cooperate. He was concerned that the\nOregon law would not condone his prescribing of a lethal agent, since his\npatient was not terminal according to the terms of the law. He reasoned,\nhowever, that, as she became increasingly suicidal without the hope of\npsychiatric care, she, in fact, would commit suicide within the next six\nmonths. He knew that the Oregon law left it up to the physician to deter-\nmine whether the six-month criterion had been met. Fearing the bad conse-\nquences of her suicide using nonmedical means, he seriously explored\nwhether to write a prescription for barbiturates that would, with medical\nsupervision, lead to her death. If he determined she met the terms of the\nlaw and remained mentally competent, he believed he could, with reluc-\ntance, write the prescription. Ms. Rheel died with her husband and\nDr. Carver at her side. Her death was reported under the terms of the law.",

She is independent in basic daily activities but has worsening short-term memory and needs help managing finances. She clearly explains her diagnosis, the medical aid-in-dying (MAID) process, and that she wants control before her cognition declines. She describes daily distress about her loss of independence. She reports intermittent low mood and hopelessness since diagnosis. A psychiatric evaluation last month found no psychosis or major depressive disorder impairing judgment. Her spouse reports occasional days of marked confusion, raising concern for fluctuating capacity. She denies an immediate plan or intent for unsupervised self-harm. Today she presents a written, witnessed MAID request and asks you to initiate the process now. She refuses further psychiatric evaluation and does not consent to any involuntary hold. Under local law and hospital policy, you may prescribe under the protocol if capacity and voluntariness are documented, or you may decline and pursue urgent mental health evaluation. If you decline today, an emergency psychiatric pathway is activated, often involving involuntary detention or medication, and MAID is deferred. A required neuropsych reassessment next month may change her eligibility, and no alternate MAID prescriber can see her sooner.",
