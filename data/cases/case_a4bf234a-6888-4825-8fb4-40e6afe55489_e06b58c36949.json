She declines the influenza vaccine. She says she felt unwell for days after a prior shot and does not want “anything injected” unless she chooses it. The unit director asks for an occupational health clearance today because respiratory viruses are already circulating and several staff have called in sick. You are the occupational health physician. Hospital policy allows staff to decline vaccination if they accept added precautions, and it also allows temporary reassignment away from high-risk units when supervisors request it. Keeping her in her current role without vaccination could increase risk to vulnerable patients and coworkers. Reassigning her could strain staffing and feels coercive to her.",
