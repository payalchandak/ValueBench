      "source_text": "The case of Jeanette\nJeanette is a 50-year-old woman with widespread\nfl\ndisease, including bony metastases [cancer whch\nhas spread to the bones] from a renal [kidney]\ntumour. Having so far been treated for cancer as an\noutpatient, she is admitted to hospital when her\ncondition deteriorates. She is in constant pain, even\nwhen resting or performing only minimal move-\nments. Radiotherapy has given her some relief from\nher symptoms, but this was short-lived; she is now\nreceiving high doses of opioid drugs.\nJeanette explains to her doctor, Dr Hearn, that noth-\nff\ning anyone has ever done has made any appreciable\ndi erence to her increasing pain. However, she contin-\nues to ask for opioids to be provided. Dr Hearn discusses\n– this request with Jeanette and he learns that she is taking\nthe drugs because, although they do not adequately\ntackle her pain, they do help her to go to sleep.\nAfter consultation with his colleagues on the\nward and on the oncology team, Dr Hearn concludes\nthat Jeanette has very few treatment options remain-\ning. She is now very frail and seriously unwell, and\nDr Hearn believes that she has only days left to live.\nHe approaches an anaesthetist at the hospital in the\nhope that she might be able to administer spinal\nanalgesics, which could provide Jeanette with pain\nrelief through a line inserted at the base of her spine.\nThe anaesthetist, Dr Robertson, is unwilling to per-\nform the procedure, since she is concerned about the\n–\nbed sores that Jeanette has at the base of her back\ninserting the line could expose Jeanette to the risk of\nserious infection.\n’\nDr Hearn is disappointed with the anaesthetist s\ndecision, since he feels that, even if there is a risk of\nff\ninfection, it is more harmful to leave her su ering\nfi\nand in pain throughout her nal days. He explains to\nJeanette that the only remaining option is to try\nincreasing her analgesics again, which she agrees to.\nUnfortunately, as is sometimes the case, the opioids\nff\ncause her to su er from distressing hallucinations and\nconfusion, while her pain is unrelieved. Dr Hearn\ndecreases the opioids back to the previous level.\nJeanette now says that her situation is so intoler-\nable that she would rather be asleep than awake and in\npain. She fully understands that her prognosis is short,\nand she asks Dr Hearn to sedate her until her death.",

Prior radiotherapy gave only brief relief. Escalating opioids has not controlled her pain and has caused distressing hallucinations and confusion, so doses were reduced. She is now frail and appears to be nearing the end of life. An anesthetist declines a neuraxial analgesic catheter because she has sacral pressure ulcers and the insertion site could seed a serious infection. The patient says she cannot tolerate being awake in pain and asks to be kept asleep until she dies. Her family wants to remain able to talk with her and worries that deep sedation could shorten her life, but they also do not want her to suffer. Hospital policy and state law allow either approach in this situation. A decision is needed tonight as her agitation and pain are escalating.",

During one tonight, she is assessed to have decision-making capacity and understands that continuous deep sedation will likely prevent further interaction. The palliative team estimates a limited prognosis but cannot say if it is days or a few weeks. A neuraxial analgesic catheter is too high risk because sacral pressure ulcers could seed infection. Overnight staffing cannot support a monitored ketamine or lidocaine infusion. Transfer is not feasible until morning. Despite adjuncts and intermittent dosing, she is expected to have recurrent severe pain and agitation overnight without continuous deep sedation. Continuous deep sedation also carries near-term risk of respiratory depression or aspiration, with possible life-shortening. She requests continuous deep sedation and explicitly refuses proportional sedation. Her family asks to keep her awake enough to talk and finish goodbyes. You must enter one of two mutually exclusive sedation protocols tonight.",
