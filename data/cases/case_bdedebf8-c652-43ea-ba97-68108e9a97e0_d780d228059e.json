She was diagnosed with asthma at the\nage of 6 and has had several admissions to hospital with severe asthma attacks. She is now\nat boarding school and feels that over the past few months her asthma has not been as well\ncontrolled as before, despite taking her inhalers regularly. On closer questioning you discover\nthat she is only really symptomatic during extreme exertion, but Shania feels that she would\nlike to try stronger treatment as her breathing is affecting her during running and she wants\nto compete at county level at the upcoming cross-country sports events.\nQuestions\n• When is a young person considered competent to make healthcare decisions?\n• Are there any limitations on what treatments a young person can consent to?\n• What is the role of parents of a competent child in healthcare decision making?",

She now reports tightness and wheeze only with intense running. She wants “stronger” daily medication so she can compete in an upcoming county cross-country meet next week. Her current exam is normal, and she has no recent night symptoms or urgent visits. She asks you not to contact her parents. She says they “overreact” and might pull her from sports. You think a step-up controller regimen could reduce exercise symptoms, but it also adds monitoring needs and potential adverse effects, and you are not fully confident she will follow up once she returns to school. The school nurse can supervise inhaler use but cannot consent. Under local policy, a capable adolescent may consent to asthma treatment, and involving parents is also permitted.

        "vignette": "A 15-year-old girl with asthma is seen in clinic while home from boarding school. Last year she was admitted to the ICU for a sudden severe exacerbation during sports. She now has chest tightness and wheeze only with intense running. She uses albuterol before practices but still sometimes has to stop. She is not on a daily controller. Her exam is normal today. Spirometry and exercise testing are not available at this visit, and her next appointment is after a major competition next week, when she will be back at school. Given her prior ICU admission, another exercise-induced attack during next week’s competition could be life-threatening without step-up therapy and a clear emergency plan. She asks that you not contact her parents. She says they become very anxious and may limit her athletics, and she worries she will avoid follow-up and continue relying on albuterol alone if you tell them. Starting an inhaled corticosteroid now could reduce symptoms but adds the need for monitoring and reassessment for side effects and effectiveness, and this would be difficult to arrange before she returns to school if her parents are not involved. School staff can remind her to use inhalers but cannot coordinate emergency planning. Local policy permits either confidential adolescent consent or parent notification when safety is at stake. You must decide today.",
