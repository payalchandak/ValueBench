During the visit, you recognize the patient as strongly resembling a “wanted” bulletin recently circulated to clinicians about a fugitive indicted for involvement with explosives. The patient gives a different name, asks for privacy, and becomes guarded when you ask routine identifying questions. You cannot confirm the identity in the chart, and you are unsure if this is a mistaken resemblance. If you contact law enforcement now, officers may arrive while the patient is still in the clinic, which could escalate and endanger staff and other patients. If you do not report, you may be allowing a potentially dangerous person to leave without intervention. Hospital counsel confirms that either maintaining confidentiality or notifying law enforcement is legally permissible here. The visit is ending, and the patient is preparing to leave.",

        "vignette": "An adult patient presents for a routine dermatology follow-up and requests continuation of a chronic medication. Missing even a short refill has previously led to a painful disease flare and urgent care visits. During the visit you notice the patient resembles a photo in a recent hospital security alert about a “person of interest” wanted for questioning in a serious assault. The photo is several months old and low quality, but you also notice a similar distinctive neck tattoo. The alert notes the person may be armed and asks staff to report any suspected match because the individual may return to the hospital. The patient registered as a walk-in, paid cash, declines to show photo ID, and requests that the visit remain confidential and that no one contact law enforcement. The EHR has no stored photo, and registration cannot verify identity. Clinic security is off-site. The patient is here with a small child and is now leaving. Counsel confirms that maintaining confidentiality or alerting law enforcement is legally permissible because identity is unconfirmed and there is no specific imminent threat.",
