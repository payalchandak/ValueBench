She has been your patient for three years and has generally adhered to treatment recommendations. When asked why she wants the records, she declines to provide a reason, stating only that she wants to review them herself. Her chart includes detailed psychiatric notes documenting periods of acute anxiety, intrusive thoughts about her health, and a previous episode in which she became intensely distressed after misinterpreting laboratory results as indicating serious illness. At that time, she required additional urgent counseling visits to address catastrophic health beliefs. Her anxiety is currently well-controlled on medication. You are concerned that unsupervised review of detailed clinical documentation—particularly psychiatric assessments and diagnostic considerations that were ultimately ruled out—may trigger significant psychological distress and undermine her current stability. However, she is legally entitled to access her own records without providing justification. You are the treating physician and must decide whether to release the records immediately.",
