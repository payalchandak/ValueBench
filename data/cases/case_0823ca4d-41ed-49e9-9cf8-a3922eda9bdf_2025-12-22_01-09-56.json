As he is her primary caregiver, she feels dependent on him and pleads with you not to say anything to him about it.\nHow would you handle this situation?\na. This is a case of elder abuse and the doctor is required to always report incidents of abuse to the authorities.\nb. The doctor is not permitted under HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) to report the abuse.\nc. The laws supporting reporting elder abuse allow the doctor to break confidentiality and report suspected abuse.\nd. The patient should not be reported. Instead, she should obtain support and access to other services in order to maintain her primary caregiver.",
