His friend Carlos has had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for many years. He is now in the terminal stages of the disease and is in constant pain and suffering. Carlos and Patrick have been friends for a long time and Patrick has always said that he would be there to support Carlos. Carlos now asks him to travel with him to Dignitas in Switzerland so that he can be assisted to end his life. Patrick wants to be there for his friend. Personally he does not have any ethical quandaries about whether he should prevent Carlos from making a decision to seek assistance to end his own life. However, he is worried that he now has professional responsibilities and duties, which would be compromised by travelling to Switzerland with Carlos.\nQuestions\n• What does deontological theory say about duties and obligations?\n• To what extent must duties be followed irrespective of the consequences?\n• According to deontological theory is it morally acceptable for Patrick to take his friend to Dignitas?",

He has severe, constant pain despite high-dose opioids and adjuvant medications. He is alert and consistent in conversation. Psychiatry finds no delirium and no major depression impairing decision-making. He asks you, his attending physician, to start the process for medical aid in dying, stating he wants control over the timing and to avoid further decline. His sister begs you not to “help him die” and asks for deeper sedation instead. The patient says he fears being continuously sedated because he wants a few more meaningful days awake. His symptoms are worsening and he is likely to lose the ability to swallow medications soon, which would close the window for his preferred plan.
