      "source_text": "_. Case 3-4\nThe Eager Research Subject: Justifying External Moral Standards\nDr. Laura Bollinger was a 62-year-old former college professor of biology\nwho had taken early retirement when she developed macular degeneration\nthat produced blindness. Over the years in which her sight was deteriorat-\ning, she began researching the causes and potential therapies for blind-\nness. She had been a patient in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH)\nAge-Related Eye Disease Study and had developed a friendship with NIH\nscientists at the National Eye Institute. In particular, she came to know and\nbecame friends with Dr. Anton Hakola, one of the leading researchers in\nthe vision restoration lab.\nFrom that friendship, she learned of some avant-garde research that\nwas arousing the interest of the research ophthalmology community. With\nthe development of microcircuity electronics, some scientists believed that\neventually the technology would be developed that could produce an artifi-\ncial eye. In effect, it would be a miniature camera that converted images into\nelectrical impulses that could be fed directly into the occipital lobe of the\nbrain, thus bypassing a damaged eye. At the point Dr. Bollinger heard about\nthese ideas, the research was in its earliest stages. Very few animal studies\nhad been completed. She knew that eventually researchers would want to\nattempt the development of this technology in humans, who could give much\nmore precise feedback on the placing of the electrodes into the brain.\nAfter extensive research on the safety and potential effectiveness of\nthis line of research, Dr. Bollinger gradually came to the conclusion that\nshe would be the ideal research subject. She was blind, had a deep interest\nin developing such technology, and had the scientific capacity to under-\nstand the risks and to cooperate with the investigators. She also had large\namounts of time available. She offered her services to Dr. Hakola.\nHesitant at first, he came to believe that Dr. Bollinger understood ex-\nactly what she was doing and could, in fact, be a significant contributor to\nthe research. She understood that the research would involve cutting a\nhalf-dollar-sized hole in her skull, through which researchers could pass\nelectrodes. Similar work had been done over the years to map the location\nof motor and sensory areas of the brain, but these experiments were often\ndone on patients who needed to have their skulls opened for some thera-\npeutic purpose. This project would involve a much larger hole, and it would\nbe undertaken solely for research purposes.\nA protocol was developed and presented to an institutional review\nboard (IRB), a hospital board responsible for reviewing research to assure\nthat subjects are protected. Several members of that board questioned the\nresearch on the grounds that it posed risks that were too great and that the\nresearch must first be developed in lower animal species before being\ntried in humans. After extensive debate, the IRB refused to approve the pro-\nposal until further animal studies were completed. These could take two to\nthree years.\nDr. Bollinger was disturbed, indeed annoyed, at the IRB decision. She\nunderstood that she was very unlikely to benefit from the study. Surely the\nfirst results would produce nothing more than a crude visual image of light\nand dark patterns, and that could take many years. She was unlikely to live\nlong enough for the technology to be perfected. On the other hand, she felt\na close identification with the community of the visually impaired and felt\nshe had a moral right to make her unique contribution, as long as scientists\nwere willing to accept her as a research subject. She was willing to sign\nany legal release from liability that seemed necessary. If Dr. Bollinger and\nDr. Hakola both find this research at this time to be moral and the informed\nconsent is impeccable, are there moral standards to which the IRB can\nappeal that would justify delaying the research?",
