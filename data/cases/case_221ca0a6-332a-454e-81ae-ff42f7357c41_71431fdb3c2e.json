      "source_text": "Case 6-7\nDishonest Colleagues: Intentionally Shorting Tablet Counts\nAfter Lorine Lance, Pharm.D., counseled Ferris Janowski, an elderly pa-\ntient, about his three cardiac maintenance medications, she was surprised\nby Mr. Janowski's final question, “Would you please open these prescrip-\ntions and count them for me so that I know I'm getting what I paid for?\nThere was a letter in my favorite advice column last night that told about\nhow you can get shorted on your prescriptions, so I just want to make sure\nall the pills are there. No offense meant, you understand. I just can’t afford\nto pay for pills and not get them.”\nMr. Janowski's prescriptions had been filled by the owner of the phar-\nmacy, Glen Battin, R.Ph., who would not be in for several hours. Dr. Lance\ndecided to humor Mr. Janowski and opened the first bottle. To her dismay,\nthe prescription was four tablets short. She made up the difference. The\nremaining two prescriptions were also short by the same amount—four\npills each. Dr. Lance remedied the shortage in these two and returned all\nthree prescriptions to Mr. Janowski. “I guarantee you that these are filled\naccurately and fully,” Dr. Lance told Mr. Janowski as she handed him his\nmedications.\nMr. Janowski was not the only patient with concerns about shortages\nthat day. Evidently, several patients were prompted by the newspaper ar-\nticle to count their pills and found less than there should have been.\nDr. Lance took numerous calls from angry patients and tried to determine if\nthe caller might have miscounted, lost a pill, or took more than they should\nhave, all reasons that the prescriptions could appear short. She noted that\nall of the prescriptions that patients claimed were shorted were for mainte-\nnance drugs and that Mr. Battin had filled them. _\nWhen Mr. Battin arrived at the pharmacy, an exhausted Dr. Lance told\nhim about what she had discovered and the number of dissatisfied pa-\ntients that called to complain about shortages. She was certain Mr. Battin\nwould have a reasonable explanation. He stated, “It's really a shame that\nadvice column printed that letter. We'll have to stop shorting maintenance\nprescriptions for a while until people get over the excitement and the need\nto count every prescription.”\nDr. Lance could not believe what she was becreg. ‘You mean that you\nhave been shorting prescriptions?” Mr. Battin shrugged, “Just the mainte-\nnance prescriptions and only on the higher-end products. People don't miss\nthree or four pills a month and the pharmacy recoups a steady amount. ©\nBesides, they always come in for a refill before they run out, so the patients\naren't harmed.” /\nDr. Lance had always admired Mr. Battin, but his nonchalant admis-\nsion of guilt instantly changed her appraisal of her employer. She had\nnever knowingly shorted a prescription. How could she work for someone\nwho did it as a matter of course? Furthermore, what should she do about\nthis dishonest behavior?",
