      "source_text": "The cases of C and F\nC and F were two girls, aged three and nine years of\nage respectively, both of whose parents were sepa-\nrated. The children lived with their mothers, each of\nwhom refused to consent to their daughters receiv-\ning a range of vaccinations, including the combined\nmeasles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. The girls\nmothers were opposed to vaccination because they\nfelt that it posed unacceptable risks – indeed, there\nhad, at the time, been much media coverage of\nresearch which suggested an association between\nreceiving the vaccine and developing autism and\nbowel problems (Wake eld et al., 1998).\n’\nThe girls fathers were, however, in favour of them\nbeing immunized, because they felt that this was in\n’\nthe children s best interests. The fathers approached\nthe courts for permission for the injections to be given\nand (although there were some di erences in their\nfi ff\nsituations) the two cases were considered together.\nACTIVITY: Stop here for a moment. Based on\nfi\nwhat little information you have, what do you think\n’\nyou would decide if you were the judge? Consider\narguments both for authorizing the vaccinations and\nfor prohibiting them.\nMr Justice Sumner, in the High Court, basically agreed\n’\nwith the girls fathers: he ruled that it would be in\n’\nfl each child s best interests to receive a range of vacci-\nnations. He did recognize that the mothers (and their\ndaughters) were owed the right to respect for their\nprivate and family life, but he further noted how these\nfi\nrights were quali ed by the need to protect the\nhealth of the children. He also thought that, in time,\nff\nthe mothers would be able to come to terms with his\ndecision, despite any initial upset they might feel.\nThe mothers decided to appeal to the Court of\nAppeal, but here too their case failed. This court ruled\nthat the trial judge had been guided by the right\nconsiderations, since he had determined the best\ninterests of the children by considering both the\nmedical evidence and other factors relevant to the\nwelfare of the children. However, the appeal judges\nconceded that Mr Justice Sumner had been particu-\nlarly thorough in his consideration of the medical\nevidence, but they felt that this was entirely appro-\npriate given the crucial importance of this evidence.\nLike the trial judge before them, the appeal judges\nfelt that the balance tipped considerably in favour of\nthe combined MMR vaccination and away from the\n’\nunreliable evidence presented by the mothers legal\nteam which was, said Lord Justice Sedley, ‘junk\n’\nscience .",
