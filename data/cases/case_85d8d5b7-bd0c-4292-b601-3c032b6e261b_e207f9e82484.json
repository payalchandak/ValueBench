The fetal heart tracing in the ED is concerning, and the on-call obstetrician believes an emergent repeat cesarean is the safest way to prevent catastrophic deterioration for both patient and fetus. The patient is awake and can state her name and situation, but she is in intense pain and intermittently vomiting; she repeatedly says she does not want surgery, asks for “anything else,” and insists on waiting for her partner and trying to deliver vaginally because of a prior traumatic operative experience. The attending must decide whether to treat her refusal as binding or to proceed urgently, arguing that the emergency and her distress make it impossible to obtain a reliable refusal in time.",

The obstetrician strongly suspects uterine rupture or placental abruption with ongoing hemorrhage. The OR team is ready and estimates 8 minutes to incision if they go now; delaying 5–10 minutes could plausibly result in fetal hypoxic injury or death and worsening maternal shock.
