Her parents insist on knowing what is “really going on” before taking her home today. She appears oriented and can describe options and consequences, but her emotions are labile.

        "vignette": "A 16-year-old girl is seen with her parents for several weeks of depressed mood and irritability after a breakup. When interviewed alone, she has recent superficial forearm cuts consistent with non-suicidal self-injury. She reports one recent episode of drinking and more frequent cutting since the breakup. She denies a current suicide plan or intent and has no prior attempts, but she endorses brief passive death thoughts. Firearms are stored in a home safe. She knows the access code is sometimes left in an unlocked desk and has searched for it when overwhelmed. She asks you not to tell her parents. She expects punitive responses and says she would stop seeking care. An ED evaluation today could provide same-day risk assessment, observation, and means-restriction counseling, but she refuses voluntary transfer. She can see her therapist tomorrow. Her parents demand specifics before the two-hour drive home and say they will not return without them. Clinic policy allows either approach when risk is ambiguous. You must decide before she leaves.",
