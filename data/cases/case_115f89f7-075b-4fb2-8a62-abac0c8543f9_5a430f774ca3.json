      "source_text": "CASE 94:\nDISCLOSURE OF DIAGNOSIS AND CULTURAL\nRELATIVISM\nAn 85-year-old Japanese man, Aiko, who came to the UK 10 years ago to live with his chil-\ndren, is admitted with haematuria. He has known bladder cancer but has been under sur-\nveillance with regular cystoscopy for many years and during this time has had multiple\nadmissions with frank haematuria. These have usually been secondary to urinary tract infec-\ntions. Unfortunately, on this occasion it is discovered that his bladder cancer has turned\naggressive and spread rapidly. He is found to have multiple metastases and it is likely that he\nis in the terminal stage of his disease.\nHis son and daughter arrange a meeting with the oncologist and are insistent that their father\nshould not be informed of his prognosis, since they feel that he will ‘give up’. Rather, they ask\nthat ‘we should respect him and not directly tell him of his prognosis so that he might enjoy\nthe last part of his life’. The oncologist agrees to discuss their request with the other members\nof the clinical team.\nThe palliative care nurse insists that the patient has a right to know so that any palliative\ntreatment that is given can be obtained with informed consent. The senior ward nurse takes\nthe view that the team should balance the risks and benefits of telling the truth to this patient.\nThe registrar believes that Aiko himself should be asked how much he wants to know.\nQuestions\n• Is there a moral obligation to tell Aiko his prognosis?\n• To what extent should cultural beliefs and practices influence your decision making?",

His son and daughter request a family meeting and insist you not tell him the prognosis. They say direct disclosure would cause despair and that their family tradition is to shield elders from bad news.
