      "source_text": "CASE 47:\nWHEN TO SECTION A PATIENT UNDER THE MENTAL\nHEALTH ACT\nKate is 27 and lives at home with her parents and younger brother. She studied a nthropology\nat university and had been in a long-term relationship. After leaving university with a good\ndegree, she struggled to get a job. She eventually found work in a restaurant, which she\nseemed to enjoy. Last year her boyfriend moved out and she decided to quit her job and move\nback home. Over the past year her family has become increasingly worried about her health\nand behaviour. Her personal care has deteriorated and she has slowly withdrawn from inter-\nacting with her family. She has not bothered to find a job locally and only leaves her bedroom\nto wash and get food from the kitchen. Kate has also begun to clean her hands obsessively\nalthough otherwise she does not seem to wash. Her room smells stale and she has refused to\nlet her mum change her bedding. She does not seem to change her clothes and does not allow\nthem to be washed with the family clothes. Her mother has noticed that Kate’s hands are raw\nand that she has sores on her back and her legs. She refused to speak to a GP about her mood,\nand in desperation Kate’s parents have spoken to their GP about what can be done. The GP\nwas concerned enough to attempt a home visit, but on arrival Kate refused to come out of her\nroom, saying that she was just having a break from the stresses of living.\nQuestions\n• Could Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?\n• Should Kate be detained for assessment or treatment under the Mental Health Act?",

        "vignette": "A community mental health nurse and social worker conduct a same-day home visit for Ms. L, a 43-year-old woman with schizoaffective disorder who recently stopped attending clinic. Neighbors report she has not been seen outside for 2–3 weeks and there is a strong odor from her apartment. When the team arrives, Ms. L speaks through a locked door and refuses to let anyone enter or examine her, repeatedly stating, “You’re with the building and you’re here to poison me.” Her speech is tangential and she cannot explain how she would obtain food, water, or medications if she continues to avoid leaving the apartment. Through the partially opened door, the nurse notes Ms. L appears markedly thin, with dry cracked lips, and has multiple excoriations on her forearms with surrounding redness and drainage suggestive of infection. Ms. L says she has had “no appetite,” has not taken her antipsychotic or diabetes medications for weeks because they are “contaminated,” and she has been scratching because “bugs are under my skin.” She repeatedly requests privacy (“Just leave; I don’t want anyone inside”) but will agree to briefly talk from the doorway and is willing to accept sealed water bottles/food left outside. The team must decide how to respond given concern for impaired capacity due to paranoid delusions and imminent medical risk from self-neglect (dehydration, uncontrolled diabetes, possible cellulitis).",
