Tonight a diabetes specialist nurse has presented a case of\na 16-year-old girl, Stephanie, who has suffered from diabetes since a young age. Stephanie has\npreviously had well-controlled blood sugar levels with a four times daily insulin regime and\ncarbohydrate counting. Over the last year, however, the nurse has become very concerned\nabout a decline in her physical health. She does not think that Stephanie is taking her i nsulin\nregularly as she is losing weight, has had recurrent infections and her blood sugars have\nrisen. She has also missed several important appointments including one with the paediatric\nconsultant. Whenever the nurse tries to discuss her diabetic control, Stephanie closes up and\ninsists her medication control is fine. The nurse is at a loss as to how to help Stephanie further.\nQuestions\n• How can Stephanie’s non-engagement with treatment be managed?\n• How can the medical profession encourage teenagers to engage with healthcare?",

She improves after IV fluids and insulin, but bedside testing still shows persistent ketones.

When you speak with her alone, she says she has been skipping insulin on purpose and does not want her parents told. She understands that she could become critically ill or die, but says family conflict will worsen if they find out and she will stop coming to clinic. You think ongoing unsupervised management is unlikely to be safe. There is no guardian at the bedside, and discharge planning must be made within hours.
