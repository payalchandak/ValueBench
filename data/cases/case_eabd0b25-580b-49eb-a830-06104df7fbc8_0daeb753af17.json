Following her\nfirst trimester scan at 13 weeks she was informed that she was high risk for having a child with\nDown’s syndrome. She underwent further diagnostic testing in the form of amniocenteses\nwhich confirmed the diagnosis. The couple is distraught as they had tried for a long time to conceive, but Adele does not think she can cope with a baby with Down’s syndrome. Despite\ncounselling, Adele is now sure that she wants to terminate the pregnancy. She visits her GP\nto request a termination. However, the GP is a practising Roman Catholic with a strong faith,\nand he does not wish to participate in abortion services.",

A 24-year-old patient, Ms. R., is 20 weeks and 5 days pregnant and requests help obtaining a pregnancy termination after learning on ultrasound that the fetus has severe anomalies. In their region, most clinics will not provide termination after 22 weeks, and the nearest out-of-state center is a 6-hour drive. Ms. R. has limited savings, cannot take repeated days off work, and says that if she misses the window she will be forced to continue the pregnancy.\n\nThe out-of-state center tells Dr. Patel’s office that an expedited appointment is sometimes possible within 48–72 hours, but only if they receive a clinician-completed intake packet (recent ultrasound report, relevant labs) and a same-day clinician-to-clinician call confirming gestational age and medical details. Without that handoff, their first available intake is 10–12 days away—likely after the 22-week cutoff. \n\nFQHC leadership has issued a written directive that clinicians must not personally arrange abortion referrals or make direct scheduling calls because of organizational policy and fear that perceived facilitation could jeopardize funding and invite political/legal scrutiny; staff may provide general information and release records on request. Dr. Patel must decide what to do today, knowing Ms. R.’s decision is time-sensitive and that the clinic also has obligations to maintain access for many other patients.",
