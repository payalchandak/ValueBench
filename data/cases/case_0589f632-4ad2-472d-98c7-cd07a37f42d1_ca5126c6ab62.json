      "source_text": "Case 8-3\nContinuing Treatment of a Patient Who Will Not Pay Her Bills\nA thoracic surgeon, Beau Schenker, MD, was called to the Emergency De-\npartment to evaluate and treat Nelda Thomas, a 40-year-old female who\nhad chest pain of sudden onset. Her history pointed to lung disease, not\ncardiac problems. The exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the left\nchest, and x-rays confirmed free air in the chest that had collapsed the left\nlung. Dr. Schenker determined that the patient had a spontaneous pneumo-\nthorax. He discussed with Ms. Thomas the well-established treatment: a\nchest tube. Dr. Schenker stated, “We will need to insert a small tube into\nyour chest to withdraw the air and allow the lung to re-expand.”\nMs. Thomas and her husband were relieved to learn that the chest pain\nwas not the result of a heart problem and agreed quickly to the procedure,\nwhich was successful.\nDuring the brief hospital stay, Dr. Schenker and Mr. Thomas, the pa-\ntient's husband, reminisced about their days in high school since they co-\nincidentally attended the same school. Ms. Thomas was seen several times\nfor appropriate follow-up in Dr. Schenker's office after her hospitalization.\nSeveral months later, Dr. Schenker’s business manager reported that the\nbalance of Ms. Thomas's bill had not been paid. Since Dr. Schenker’s office\nhad a policy of not using collection companies, Dr. Schenker said “write the\nbill off.”\nTwo years later, Ms. Thomas was once again in the emergency room\n(ER) for recurrence of the same problem. She requested to be seen by\nDr. Schenker. When the Emergency Department paged Dr. Schenker, he ad-\nvised the staff to call another available thoracic surgeon to see Ms. Thomas.\nA few minutes later, Mr. Thomas called Dr. Schenker directly at his office.\nMr. Thomas admitted he had not paid the earlier bill (although Dr. Schenker\nhad not brought up the matter) and promised to pay the old balance and\nthen prepay for the costs of his wife's current needs. Dr. Schenken replied,\n“It's not about the money but about mutual respect. I am sorry but I cannot\ntake care of your wife at this time. Another thoracic surgeon will take the\ncase so you have nothing to worry about.” Ms. Thomas was treated suc-\ncessfully by another physician. Should Dr. Schenker have relented and\ntaken the case the second time?",
