        "vignette": "During a winter respiratory surge, the medical ICU is operating at maximum capacity with several critically ill patients boarding in the emergency department and additional transfer requests from smaller hospitals. A 68-year-old man with severe COPD was admitted to the ICU with pneumonia, was intubated, and is now improving: he is awake, hemodynamically stable, and on minimal ventilator support, but he still needs frequent suctioning, close monitoring during spontaneous breathing trials, and rapid response if he tires or aspirates. The step-down unit can care for ventilated patients but has fewer nurses and less respiratory therapy coverage overnight. The ICU attending, following a hospital surge policy reviewed by a triage officer, must decide whether to keep him in the ICU until he is safely extubated or move him out now to open an ICU bed for other patients expected to need immediate intensive support.",

He is awake, following commands, and on high-flow nasal cannula (40 L/min, FiO2 0.40) with stable blood pressure and heart rate, no vasopressors, and improving blood gases. By unit criteria, he is eligible for transfer to a step-down unit (stable hemodynamics, no vasoactive infusions, no invasive lines).\n\nHowever, his risk of extubation failure remains nontrivial: he has copious secretions, a weak cough, and required frequent suctioning overnight. If he decompensates, he may need rapid reintubation and immediate ICU-level rescue.\n\nAt the same time, the ED calls about a 45-year-old woman with septic shock from pneumonia who has been on a peripheral norepinephrine infusion for 3 hours and is becoming more hypoxemic despite noninvasive support.
