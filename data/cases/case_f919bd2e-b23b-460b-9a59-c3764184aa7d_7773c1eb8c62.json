He says he is “done” and refuses antibiotics or hospitalization, asking for comfort-focused care only. He is awake and conversant, but his reasoning centers on hopelessness and fear of further decline. His adult daughter arrives and insists he would want treatment if he were “thinking clearly.” Pneumonia treatment needs to start soon to be effective.
