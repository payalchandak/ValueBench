He has\nan infected, draining toe with bone exposed, cellulitis, and x-ray evidence\nof osteomyelitis brought on by the poor arterial circulation related to his\nIDDM. He is noncompliant in visits to the outpatient clinic for care of his\ninfection, has no insurance coverage, refuses social worker and psychiat-\nric consults, and now is refusing further debridement of the decaying tissue\naround the infection.\nMr. Johnson had on previous visits been seen by a consulting psychia-\ntrist who found him to be eccentric, a semiretired man who had done janito-\nrial work and odd jobs through his adult life. The psychiatrist had found\nsome depression but no evidence of mental illness that would have made it\npossible to declare him incompetent.\nDr. Maria Garcia was very concerned about the infection. She was\nafraid that he would lose the toe or, worse, the foot, from gangrene if\nMr. Johnson did not receive aggressive treatment.\nShe contemplated hospitalizing him and using sedation in order to\ntreat the foot. She could not imagine his losing a toe or foot simply because\nhe was so stubborn he would not agree to her recommendation.",

The patient is alert, can clearly explain his situation and the potential consequences, and repeatedly refuses further procedures or admission, saying he “doesn’t want to be cut on” and wants to go home; he also declines social work and mental health evaluation.

On arrival, his fingerstick glucose is 42 mg/dL; he is diaphoretic, intermittently somnolent, and gives inconsistent answers. After IV dextrose he becomes more conversant but remains tangential and cannot reliably explain back his diagnosis or the risks/benefits of treatment. He is febrile to 38.6°C, HR 118, and the ulcer is malodorous with erythema tracking up the midfoot. Plain films are concerning for osteomyelitis.\n\nThe ED clinician and podiatry recommend admission for IV antibiotics, glucose monitoring, and possible urgent debridement to prevent sepsis and amputation. The patient repeatedly insists on leaving, stating: (1) he is terrified the hospital will “take my foot,” (2) he cannot miss work or he will lose his job, (3) he is the sole caregiver for his mother at home, and (4) he is uninsured and believes he will be “bankrupted” by admission. He initially refuses to let staff call his sister because he “doesn’t want to worry anyone.”\n\nThe clinician is concerned that the patient’s decision-making capacity is impaired right now due to fluctuating mental status from hypoglycemia and infection. The team attempts less-restrictive alternatives: they correct his glucose, give food, recheck serial glucoses, provide quiet observation for several hours, repeat a focused capacity assessment, and involve social work to explore caregiver coverage, transportation, rapid follow-up, and financial assistance. During lucid moments the patient can state he has a serious infection but cannot consistently demonstrate understanding of the immediate risks of leaving (sepsis, limb loss, death) or compare options; minutes later he becomes confused again.
