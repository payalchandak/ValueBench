      "source_text": "Case 13-3\nThe Cruzan Case: Whether to Forgo Nutrition\nBased on a Patient’s Views\nAt 12:54 a.m., January 11, 1983, police were called to the scene of a single car\naccident. They arrived six minutes later and found Nancy Cruzan lying\nface down in a ditch thirty-five feet from her car without detectable cardiac\nor respiratory function. At 1:12 a.m., spontaneous cardiac and respiratory\nfunction was restored, but there had been significant anoxia for as much as\ntwelve to fourteen minutes.\nNancy was left with permanent brain damage, in a coma for three\nweeks. A gastrostomy was performed on February 7, consented to by her\n(then) husband. Since then she had been at Mount Vernon State Hospital,\nfed entirely by gastrostomy tube. At the time of review of the case, she was\nnot on a ventilator, was oblivious to her environment except for reflexive\nresponses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli, and had a massive en-\nlargement of the ventricles of her brain that were filling with cerebrospinal\nfluid. The finding was that cerebral cortical atrophy was irreversible, per-\nmanent, progressive, and ongoing.\nThe highest cognitive brain function was exhibited by her grimacing,\nperhaps in recognition of ordinarily painful stimuli, indicating the experi-\nence of pain and apparent response to sound. She was described as a\nspastic quadriplegic with irreversible muscular contracture and tendon\ndamage in all extremities, no cognitive or reflexive ability to swallow food\nor water to maintain her daily essential needs. She was alive but in a per-\nsistent vegetative state (PVS). She could live for decades in this condition.\nBefore the accident she had expressed, “in somewhat serious conver-\nsation,” that if sick or injured she would not want to continue her life unless\nshe could live “halfway normally.” Her parents, Lester and Joyce, took over\nthe role of guardian and asked the Missouri courts for permission to termi-\nnate artificial hydration and nutrition.\nThe lower court supported their request, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed, arguing the state has an unqualified interest in life without regard\nto quality. This interest took two forms: (1) prolongation of life of individual\npatients and (2) interest in sanctity of life itself. Moreover, the case raises the\nquestion of how certain we must be of the patient's wishes. In this case, Nancy\nhad not explicitly stated she would refuse nutrition and hydration medically\nsupplied. The state noted how this case differs from other famous cases in that\nNancy was not a competent patient contemporaneously refusing treatment;\nshe did not have an advance directive, she was not terminal, the treatment\ncould not be a burden to her (since she was in a vegetative state), and this case\ninvolved nutrition and hydration rather than more complex treatments.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n» Why would artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently than other\nmore complex treatments?\nShould artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently?\n/Is a “somewhat serious conversation” enough evidence to discontinue life-\nsustaining treatment? Why or why not?",

Over the past month she has had repeated tube-site infections, and the surgeon recommends replacing the tube this week. Her parents are her legal guardians. They report that, before the crash, she told them she would not want to be kept alive if she could not live “halfway normally.” She has no written directive, and other relatives dispute how firmly she held that view.
