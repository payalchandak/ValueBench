      "source_text": "Case 8-5 :\nProfiting from Self-Referral for MRIs\nFor many years internist Jonathan Birch had performed x-rays on his pa-\ntients in his private office. He billed them a reasonable charge for the time\nand materials involved, including enough to amortize the costs of the\nequipment. By the late 1980s Dr. Birch was making increased use of more\nsophisticated imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. By comparison, this equip-\nment was extremely expensive and would not be utilized sufficiently to\njustify having the equipment in his office. He began referring patients\nneeding this type of diagnostic test to an imaging center at the local hos-\npital. Patients were billed directly by the hospital. This had the effect of\nreducing Dr. Birch’s income that he used to derive from the simpler in-\noffice procedures.\nIn 1989 Dr. Birch was approached by Imaging Resources, Inc., about a\nnew free-standing imaging facility it was launching. Dr. Birch was invited\nto visit the facility and inspect its state-of-the-art equipment. Dr. Birch was\nimpressed. He considered it better than the hospital's facility and was con-\nsidering shifting his referrals to the new center.\nThe director of the center then presented an offer to Dr. Birch. He was\ninvited to invest in the center. He could buy a 1 percent interest in the facil-\nity with income on the investment projected as 12 percent. Furthermore, the\nfacility would loan Dr. Birch the money he needed to make the investment\nat 6 percent interest with the interest and principal paid off with the earn-\nings on the investment. As soon as the investment was paid off, Dr. Birch\nwould own his share in the company and would receive profits on his\nownership.\nDr. Birch realized that the more patients he referred, the better the im-\naging business would do. In effect, he would be able to recoup some of the\nincome he had lost when he shifted from x-rays in his office to the use of the\noutside imaging facility at the hospital. Dr. Birch was vaguely uncomfort-\nable with the offer he received. It could be interpreted as giving him an\nownership interest in order to influence his decisions about when to order\nimaging and what facility to recommend. He was made more uncomfort-\nable when he learned that only physicians were being offered the favor-\nable investment terms. He learned that only colleagues who did substantial\namounts of referral for imaging were approached. Even so, Dr. Birch accepted\nthe offer and the loan.\nFollow-up\nBy 1991 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was taking action\nagainst some of these joint-venture investment schemes that gave the ap-\npearance of being designed to provide financial incentives to physicians to\nchannel business to certain imaging centers. There were accusations of\nkickbacks. In response, the government issued regulations that provided\n“safe harbors,” provisions which, if met, would give physicians assurance\nthat they would not be guilty of violating anti-kickback laws. The original\nprovisions made clear that investment in large, public corporations (such as\ndrug companies) was acceptable, that physicians could provide services to\njoint ventures for a reasonable fee, and that investment terms (such as the\nloan received by Dr. Birch) had to be available to all investors, not just doc-\ntors who referred patients.* Later amendments clarified these provisions, but\nthey remain in place essentially as originally promulgated. More recently,\nregulations governing self-referral have appeared in 2001, 2004, and 2007,\nand in 2010 a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol was published pur-\nsuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).°\nAs a result of these regulations, Dr. Birch decided to repay the loan and\nmade an effort to assure that the company made a good faith effort to con-\nform to all the provisions of the safe-harbor regulations. He was convinced\nthat the company, of which he was now a minority owner, was the best fa-\ncility in town and that he would never refer a patient in order to increase\nthe profits of the company. Still, he was concerned about whether this ar-\nrangement was ethical.",

You own a small stake in that center through a physician-only investment program, and you receive quarterly distributions that increase as volume grows. Your ownership is disclosed on your clinic’s conflict-of-interest form, but most patients do not read it unless you bring it up.

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old woman sees you for three months of low back pain with intermittent right-leg tingling and a sense of “giving way,” which has become more frequent. Her strength and reflexes are normal today. She has no fever, trauma, or bowel or bladder symptoms. You are concerned about a lumbar disc herniation or other lesion and want an MRI soon to guide next steps. An earlier MRI could allow same-week neurosurgical review or an epidural steroid injection if a compressive lesion is found. The hospital MRI can schedule her in three days, and images flow directly into the hospital record for rapid specialist review. The only alternative her insurer will authorize today is an independent imaging center that can scan her tomorrow evening, but it is often out-of-network and may leave her with higher charges. Studies from that center sometimes need to be repeated at the hospital for comparison or surgical planning, which can add cost and delay treatment. You own a small interest in that center, and your income increases with its volume. The patient says she distrusts doctors who “profit off referrals” and wants to hear all imaging options before deciding. She asks you to recommend one site before she leaves. Radiology and compliance confirm that either referral is permitted with appropriate conflict management, and there is no outpatient pathway to expedite the hospital slot.",
