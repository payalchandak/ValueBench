Although\nthey have both always wanted a family, Adele initially wanted to focus on her career and\nthen struggled to conceive. When she finally fell pregnant, both Adele and her husband were\nthrilled. Unfortunately, following her first trimester scan, a nuchal screening test indicated\nthat the foetus had a high risk of suffering from Down’s syndrome. She decided to undergo\nfurther diagnostic testing, and amniocentesis confirmed Down’s syndrome. The couple is\ndistraught. They had waited a long time to conceive and wanted the ‘perfect’ baby to fit into\ntheir busy lifestyles. Adele does not feel she would ever be able to return to work if she had\nto care for a disabled child and thinks having to give up her career would be detrimental to\nher mental health. After much deliberation she visits her doctor to discuss termination of\npregnancy.",

The pregnancy is otherwise medically uncomplicated. She and her partner are distressed; she says she is not prepared to raise a child with significant additional needs and believes continuing the pregnancy would seriously undermine her ability to work and cope emotionally. She requests a termination and asks you to arrange it promptly. You think she understands the medical facts, but you also worry about the irreversibility of ending a wanted pregnancy, the possibility of later regret, and the moral weight some people attach to terminating for a disability. You must decide how to respond today.",

        "choice_2": "Do not arrange termination at this visit: recommend continuing the pregnancy for now and instead arrange further counseling and disability-focused consultation before revisiting the decision, even though delay could narrow her options."
