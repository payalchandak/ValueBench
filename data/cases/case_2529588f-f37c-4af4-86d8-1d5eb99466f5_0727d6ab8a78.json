She is taken to the local Accident and\nEmergency department by her teacher. X-rays reveal she has a nasty comminuted fracture\nof her radius, and the orthopaedic team believes that it is going to need manipulation under\nanaesthesia in order to achieve satisfactory realignment. Your surgical ST6 has asked you to\ncomplete the necessary pre-theatre checklists and to complete the consent form. You try to\nexplain to him that the parents are not present, but he reassures you that the teacher can sign\ninstead since she is the accompanying adult.\nQuestions\n• Who can consent to medical treatment for young children?\n• What happens in an emergency?",

Her teacher is present and has a school permission form for routine care, but it does not mention anesthesia or procedures. Repeated calls to the parents go to voicemail, and the tour group is scheduled to leave early morning. A theater slot and anesthesia team are available now, but if you postpone, the next opportunity may be tomorrow after significant swelling, with a higher chance of a more invasive operation and prolonged pain control. Hospital policy and state law would allow either proceeding in the child’s best interests or waiting for parental consent in this non‑life‑threatening situation. You must decide tonight.",

        "vignette": "A 7-year-old girl is brought from a school trip after a fall onto her wrist. X-rays show a displaced, comminuted distal radius fracture. She is neurovascularly intact. Pain improves with IV analgesia, but the deformity remains. The orthopedist recommends reduction soon because delay until tomorrow afternoon may make closed reduction harder due to swelling and can increase long-term stiffness or need for open reduction. ED procedural-sedation staff are not available overnight, so the plan is closed reduction and casting in the operating room under anesthesia. The teacher has a permission form for routine care that excludes anesthesia and is not a legal guardian. You have tried both parents, listed emergency contacts, and the school administrator, and no one is reachable. Overnight splinting and analgesia are feasible but will not correct displacement. An OR team is available now; the next slot is tomorrow afternoon. Hospital policy and counsel advise that either proceeding under an urgent-treatment exception with documentation or waiting for parental consent is legally permissible. You must decide tonight.",
