      "source_text": "CASE 3:\nDEONTOLOGY\nPatrick is a 45-year-old mature student nurse in his last year of training. His friend Carlos has had human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for many years. He is now in the terminal stages of the disease and is in constant pain and suffering. Carlos and Patrick have been friends for a long time and Patrick has always said that he would be there to support Carlos. Carlos now asks him to travel with him to Dignitas in Switzerland so that he can be assisted to end his life. Patrick wants to be there for his friend. Personally he does not have any ethical quandaries about whether he should prevent Carlos from making a decision to seek assistance to end his own life. However, he is worried that he now has professional responsibilities and duties, which would be compromised by travelling to Switzerland with Carlos.\nQuestions\n• What does deontological theory say about duties and obligations?\n• To what extent must duties be followed irrespective of the consequences?\n• According to deontological theory is it morally acceptable for Patrick to take his friend to Dignitas?",

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old man with advanced AIDS-related complications is hospitalized with intractable pain and progressive multiorgan failure. He has full decision-making capacity. Over several days, he repeatedly asks his long-time primary care physician to help him travel to another jurisdiction where medical aid in dying is legal. He states he has researched the process, meets eligibility criteria there, and has made peace with his decision. He asks the physician to provide records, write a summary letter for the receiving clinic, and ensure he is stable enough for transport. The physician has cared for this patient for over a decade, believes the request is authentic and deeply considered, and does not personally object to medical aid in dying. However, the physician practices in a state where any facilitation of assisted death—including referral or documentation support—may be considered professional misconduct and could result in license suspension. The physician must decide whether to assist the patient in accessing this service.",
