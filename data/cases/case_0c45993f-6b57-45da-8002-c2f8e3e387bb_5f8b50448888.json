Osman is midway through his shift when he\nreceives a bleep saying that he is required to take an arterial blood gas (ABG) from a new\nadmission. The patient is a 55-year-old gentleman who has suffered from chronic obstruc-\ntive pulmonary disease for 10 years. It is believed that he is suffering from type 2 respiratory\nfailure. Osman tells the patient that he has to take blood to confirm the diagnosis; how-\never, the patient is anxious and agitated. Furthermore, the patient reveals that he has a pho-\nbia of needles and does not want the ABG to be done. Osman states that there is no other\noption and the ABG is essential; however, the patient is becoming more hysterical. Osman is\nunsure of what to do. He is worried about asking the registrar for help, as the registrar stated\nduring the handover meeting at the start of the shift to only bleep him if it is an emergency.\nFurthermore, the registrar has a reputation for being an intimidating figure.\nQuestions\n• What should Osman do in this situation?\n• Who would be held accountable if there were complications from the procedure?\n• Are junior doctors held to the same legal standard of care as consultants?",

He can state where he is and why he came to hospital, but his agitation and fluctuating alertness raise concern that his breathing failure may be affecting his ability to weigh information.
