He is still going to work but is increasingly isolated and struggling to function. He repeatedly refuses to talk about depression and says he will not take “psychiatric medications.” Today he says he cannot keep living this way, but he also insists, “Don’t label me and don’t give me a lecture. If you push this, I won’t come back.” He asks for “something simple” and tells you he prefers not to hear details about medications. You believe an SSRI is a reasonable option, but it can cause effects he may find unacceptable and it typically requires follow-up. His next available appointment is months away due to scheduling limits.

He asks for “something simple.” He declines diagnostic labels. He will only tolerate a brief discussion and says he will stop coming if he feels pressured. He also states he will not schedule another visit just to review details, but he still requests an SSRI today. You assess moderate major depression. He is oriented, can repeat back the plan, and denies suicidal intent or plan. He has no history of mania or psychosis and no substance misuse. He refuses psychotherapy or a behavioral health referral, and the wait for those services is months. Clinic staffing rules prevent phone or portal check-ins after starting a new medication, and his next visit is months away. Untreated symptoms could worsen and new suicidal thoughts could emerge. Sertraline could help, but adverse effects and rare early worsening of suicidal thoughts could lead him to stop it without telling you. Dedicated mental-health visits are scarce and prioritized for higher-risk patients. State law and clinic policy permit brief key-risk consent or declining to prescribe if consent seems insufficient.",
