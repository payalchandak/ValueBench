      "source_text": "The case of Diane Pretty\nDiane Pretty had motor neurone disease, a condition that progressively attacks the sufferer’s muscles, leaving them increasingly dependent on others to perform even the most basic tasks. Although she had, in her own words, ‘fought this disease each step of the way’, Mrs Pretty felt that her prognosis was bleak and she was especially concerned at the possibility that she might suffocate in the final stages of her life (Dyer, 2002).\nRather than succumb to increasing dependency and a possibly distressing demise, Diane Pretty wished to obtain assistance in committing suicide, which her husband Brian was willing to provide. However, the law in England clearly condemns any such assistance: whilst suicide itself is lawful, assisting suicide is a crime that (according to the Suicide Act 1961) carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Rather than risk her husband being convicted and incarcerated, Mrs Pretty wanted confirmation from a legal official that no action would be taken against him. The official in question, the Director of Public Prosecutions, declined to make any such statement and so Mrs Pretty approached the courts in an attempt to demonstrate that the legal prohibition on assisted suicide violated her human rights.\nMrs Pretty insisted that her rights were being infringed in five ways. First, she claimed that her right to life granted her the right to determine when her life could come to an end – that is, the right to life was a right that she could waive. Secondly, she argued that the state prohibition on assisted suicide meant that she was being forced to endure an inhuman and degrading existence. Thirdly, the right to personal autonomy or privacy entailed that her autonomous decision to die be respected. Fourthly, Mrs Pretty argued that she had a right to freedom of thought and that, as such, her right to believe in the justifiability of assisted suicide should translate into her (and her husband) being free to act in accordance with this belief. Finally, Mrs Pretty pointed to the right to be free from unjust discrimination; since able-bodied persons were freely entitled to commit suicide, Mrs Pretty argued that she – as a disabled person – was being treated unfairly by the law.\nMrs Pretty’s case reached the (then) highest court in England, the House of Lords. The five Law Lords decided, unanimously, that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe Mrs Pretty’s rights (or indeed anyone else’s).\nThe right to life, they explained, did not encompass a ‘right to die’; indeed, this would be contrary to the very purpose of the right, which was to uphold the sanctity of human life. Moreover, the Law Lords were not convinced that it was the legal policy (and therefore the UK government) which was the cause of Mrs Pretty’s suffering – the true cause of this was her disease, and the only obligation owed by the state was a duty to ensure that her suffering was adequately alleviated (which fell short of enabling her to have her life ended).\nThe judges were even less persuaded by Mrs Pretty’s arguments about freedom of thought. Just because Mrs Pretty believed that assisted suicide was morally justified did not mean that the state had to recognize her right to engage in this. The Law Lords further rejected the idea that Mrs Pretty was being unjustly dealt with by the law, not least since they found no (legal) support for the idea that the decriminalization of suicide amounted to a legal ‘right to commit suicide’.\nThe House of Lords also resisted Mrs Pretty’s seemingly central claim that her decision ought to be respected since it was autonomously reached. Respect for autonomy, they reasoned, only entitled an individual to be free in the way they lived their life – and the right did not extend to seeking its ending. The judges added that, even if they were wrong about this, there were important social interests at stake (like the preservation of the sanctity of life) that justified placing limits on what an autonomous individual could do.\nMrs Pretty was neither impressed with the Law Lords’ decision nor deterred from advancing her cause. Using the same human rights arguments, she approached the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Once again, and for the final time, Mrs Pretty’s case failed. However, the European court differed from the English court in one respect: it was willing to concede that Mrs Pretty did have a right to respect for her autonomous decisions, even a decision to die. It nevertheless concluded that it was for the UK government to decide whether there were more important social interests at stake that prevented the right from prevailing.\nMrs Pretty succumbed to her disease less than two weeks after she had lost her case in Strasbourg. Unfortunately, she appears to have endured the very breathing difficulties that she had fought to avoid (Dyer, 2002).",

She is no longer able to feed herself and communicates with eye-tracking. She has frequent choking episodes and escalating shortness of breath. She remains lucid and consistently states she does not want to risk dying by suffocation. She asks you to prescribe medication for medical aid in dying and says she wants to take it while she can still swallow. Her spouse supports her request but is visibly distressed. You can offer hospice now, and palliative care can provide symptom-focused sedation if dyspnea becomes refractory, but that approach may prolong a course she finds intolerable. A recent evaluation finds no delirium and no major depression, but she is understandably anxious. State law and hospital policy permit either proceeding with aid in dying or declining and focusing on comfort care. You must decide this week because her ability to self-administer may soon be lost.",

        "vignette": "A 52-year-old woman with advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is seen in your neuromuscular clinic. She has severe bulbar weakness and uses eye-tracking to communicate. She has a gastrostomy tube but can still swallow small volumes of thin liquid. She uses noninvasive ventilation at night and now has episodic air hunger and choking on secretions. She remains decisional and repeatedly requests medical aid in dying because she wants control before she can no longer self-administer. She declines a hospice-only plan and does not want deep, continuous sedation. Hospice can start immediately, and palliative care can rapidly escalate opioids, anxiolytics, and secretion management, with proportionate palliative sedation if symptoms become refractory. With her progressive bulbar dysfunction, ingesting the aid-in-dying medication could trigger prolonged choking or aspiration compared with hospice-based symptom control. Hospital policy and state law permit either prescribing or declining. No other credentialed prescriber in your system can see her in time, and transfer would likely outlast her ability to self-administer, so declining would effectively deny her a legally available option that other patients with better access can obtain. You must decide this week.",
