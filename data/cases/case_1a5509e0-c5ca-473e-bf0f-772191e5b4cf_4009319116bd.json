        "vignette": "A 78-year-old woman with mild dementia fell at home and sustained a displaced femoral neck fracture. She is medically stable but has moderate chronic kidney disease, mild heart failure, and takes anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Without surgery, she will remain bed-bound, face certain complications from immobility including pressure ulcers and pneumonia, and will likely require permanent institutional care. Hip replacement surgery could restore her mobility and independence, allowing her to return home with family support. However, given her age and comorbidities, the surgery carries substantial perioperative risks including cardiac events, bleeding complications, delirium, and a meaningful possibility that she may not survive the procedure or immediate postoperative period. Her family is present and expresses that before her fall, she valued living independently at home above all else. You are the orthopedic surgeon deciding whether to recommend proceeding with surgery.",
