After careful eval-\nuation, excisional biopsy was plausible, and he carefully discussed with\nher the seriousness of obtaining the diagnosis with this operative proce-\ndure. She seemed to understand the situation accurately and agreed to\nhave the biopsy. At her request, he called the referring physician, 65 miles\naway. Then she insisted on the surgeon calling her sister, her niece, her\nneighbor, and her minister to inform them about the proposed treatment.\nDr. Clark complied with the request but noticed that each of the people he\ntalked to on the patient's behalf seemed confused as to why he called. Then\nshe was scheduled for the operation.\nThe patient returned in 10 days for pre-op exam and further details of\npreparation. She then asked that a different neighbor be called about her\nsituation. The surgeon realized another round of calls would be re-\nquested; he not only had little time for this but believed serious behav-\nioral problems awaited. He canceled the operation and shared his\nconcerns with her, then called the referring physician with the story and\nthe need for further evaluation now, despite the real possibility of malig-\nnant disease. He was not interested in being her physician under these\nconditions.",
