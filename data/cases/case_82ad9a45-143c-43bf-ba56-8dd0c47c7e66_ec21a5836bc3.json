      "source_text": "Case 6-5 _\nBrought to the ER after a Suicide Attempt\nMax Perrin, a 55-year-old male, was brought to the emergency room (ER) by\nthe local rescue squad following a suicide attempt by means of consuming\nrat poison. The ER physician, Dr. Christopher LeMarke, recognized him im-\nmediately, as did the ER nurses. He had been a regular in the facility,\nhaving visited for his primary medical care and for two previous suicide\nattempts within the past eighteen months. During the previous visits his\nhistory had been explored completely. He was divorced, alienated from his\nadult children, and chronically depressed but was not considered suffi-\nciently impaired that he could be declared incompetent.\nOn the basis of state law, such patients could be held for up to seventy-\ntwo hours on the signature of two physicians if they were deemed danger-\nous to themselves or others. Mr. Perrin had never before engaged in any\nbehavior that would suggest he was dangerous to others, but he surely was\na danger to himself. He had on past admissions received short-term psy-\nchotherapy and prescriptions for antidepressant drugs, but he had stopped\ntaking them because he said they made him feel sleepy.\nHe was now in the ER, incoherent and semiconscious. Should Dr. LeMarke\nsign the involuntary commitment, enlist another physician to sign as well,\nand initiate another round of therapy?",
