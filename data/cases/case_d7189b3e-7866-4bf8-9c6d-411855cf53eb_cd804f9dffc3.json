He had been on that same road just prior to\nthe explosion. He deeply grieved their deaths; subsequently, he spoke with\nan Army psychologist about his “survivor guilt.”\nHe returned to the United States and to his previous job. Ironically,\nwithin six months he was involved in a car accident in which the other driver\nwas killed. Then he developed frequent flashbacks to his war losses,\naffecting his ability to concentrate. While under therapy with a psychiatrist,\nLucille Bell, he heard from a friend that Eye Movement Desensitization and\nReprocessing (EMDR) treatment had been used successfully in such cases.\nHowever, when he sought treatment from Dr. Bell, he learned that his insur-\nance company considered his problem as a “preexisting condition” and\ndenied coverage.",

He has recurrent intrusive memories and panic when driving after a recent fatal car crash, layered on earlier combat-related grief.

Your practice can provide EMDR, but his insurer denies it as treatment for a “preexisting condition” and will not authorize payment. The clinic has a small grant that covers a limited number of EMDR courses using strict eligibility rules, and exceptions can be made at the physician’s discretion. Hospital compliance confirms that either pursuing an exception or following coverage rules is legally permissible.
