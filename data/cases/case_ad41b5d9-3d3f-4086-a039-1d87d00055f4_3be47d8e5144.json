She\nhas had two courses of chemotherapy and a total hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\nShe found the chemotherapy really tiring and had a lot of side effects. Since she was diagnosed\n18 months ago she has not been able to work. A follow-up positron emission tomography\n(PET) scan demonstrated that she had a further lesion in her breast. A biopsy confirmed\nthis to be a primary breast cancer. Her oncologist suggests a third course of chemotherapy.\nHarriet has heard about a new wonder drug which has been discussed on the news. The drug\nis reported to increase the curative rates of breast cancer in women under 50. However, there\nare few randomised drug trial data on the drug. It is also extremely expensive. Harriet wants to\nknow more about it and whether or not her doctor will prescribe it for her.\nQuestions\n• Is there a legal requirement to provide treatment on the National Health Service\n(NHS)?\n• How is the NHS funded?\n• What is the role of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)?\n• Should doctors be the gatekeepers of resource allocation?",

She has been unable to work for over a year. A new biopsy confirms a separate primary breast cancer. Her oncologist recommends standard chemotherapy again. The patient asks instead for a recently publicized targeted drug that she found online. The drug is available at the hospital, but her insurer and the institution’s formulary only cover it for patients who meet specific criteria that she does not clearly meet. An exception request would need the oncologist’s signature this week to be considered before her treatment window closes, and denial would mean starting standard therapy now or delaying care. Hospital policy allows clinicians to request exceptions when they judge it warranted, and compliance states either option is permitted.
