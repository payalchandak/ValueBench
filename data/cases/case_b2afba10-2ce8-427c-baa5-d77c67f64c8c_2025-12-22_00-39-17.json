      "source_text": "CASE 24:\nWITHHOLDING INFORMATION FROM A CHILD\nAdam is a 12-year-old boy being treated for osteosarcoma of the arm in the paediatric oncol-\nogy unit where you are working as a first year specialist trainee (ST1). Although he initially\nresponded well to treatment, he has suffered a relapse and now has widespread metastatic\ndisease. His parents have been told about his relapse and a further cycle of chemotherapy,\nwith the hope of prolonging his life by a few months, has been suggested. The chances of cure\nare negligible and the side effects likely to be very significant.\nHis parents have considered the options and decided they would like him to have further\nchemotherapy. However, they are adamant that they do not want Adam to be informed that\nhis cancer has spread or that he is likely to die even with the additional chemotherapy. They\nwish to protect him and are very worried that telling him will cause him great distress. Your\nconsultant has encouraged them to involve him in decision-making and explained that\nfamilies are encouraged to discuss things honestly with their children, even when the prog-\nnosis is terminal. However, his parents continue making plans with him for the following\nyear and telling him he needs further chemotherapy to ‘get better’.\nQuestions\n• Should Adam be involved in the decision about whether he has further chemo-\ntherapy?\n• What ethical principles should be considered when deciding whether to withhold\ninformation from a patient?",
