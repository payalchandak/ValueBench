Imaging shows progression despite prior lines of therapy. Her oncologist is offering a final course of palliative chemotherapy that could ease symptoms but may worsen nausea and fatigue. The inpatient team is worried she will not tolerate treatment without nutritional support. The nutrition service recommends total parenteral nutrition through a central line since she is eating very little and has early satiety and mouth soreness. She is alert and not septic, but she is frail and has limited mobility. Starting TPN would likely require central venous access, close monitoring, and ongoing infusions after discharge. Declining TPN would avoid procedural and line-related complications but may leave her too depleted to attempt chemotherapy and may accelerate decline.
