The clinic has a fixed, limited number of government-covered IVF cycles each year, and it uses strict eligibility rules to decide who can receive them; based on the written criteria, she falls just outside the cutoff because of a comorbidity that makes treatment more complex but not impossible. She cannot afford self-pay IVF and says that without coverage this is likely her last chance to have a genetically related child. You are the attending physician asked to decide how to handle her application under the clinic’s allocation policy.",

She has obesity (BMI 42) and obstructive sleep apnea treated inconsistently with CPAP. The program requires documented anesthesia clearance (including optimization of OSA and a pre-op assessment) before a patient can be scheduled; the clearance process typically takes 8–12 weeks and sometimes includes a request for weight-loss efforts and consistent CPAP use. The next funded IVF batch starts in 3 weeks, and only 2 publicly funded cycles remain this fiscal year. If she is not included in this batch, she will likely lose her chance at funded IVF this year because she cannot afford self-pay and she will turn 40 before the next funding cycle. \n\nHer reproductive endocrinologist estimates that proceeding now could meaningfully improve her chance of a live birth compared with waiting a year, but the anesthesiology consultant notes increased risk of airway complications, hypoxemia, and unplanned hospital admission with sedation/anesthesia in patients with untreated OSA and BMI >40, especially without documented optimization. \n\nThe patient states she understands the anesthesia risks and still strongly prefers to proceed as soon as possible due to her age; she is willing to sign additional consent but cannot self-pay. The nurse coordinator notes that approving her without clearance would displace a named next-in-line patient—an otherwise similar 34-year-old who already completed anesthesia clearance and has been waiting 10 months—because the program schedules strictly by readiness and queue position to maintain fairness.",
