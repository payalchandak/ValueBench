As part of\nher investigations you need to perform a digital rectal examination. You explain this to her\nand she consents but is obviously unhappy about it. She asks you if it can be done by a female\ndoctor. Unfortunately the only female doctor on duty is busy with a trauma call. You decide\nto go ahead and perform the examination. The patient is diagnosed with constipation and\ndischarged home with Movicol. A few weeks later your consultant calls you into his office. He\nhas received an angry letter from the patient saying she has been extremely distressed by the\nexperience and felt violated by the rectal examination. She has requested a written apology.\nQuestions\n• In what circumstances should a chaperone be present?\n• Who is an appropriate chaperone?",
