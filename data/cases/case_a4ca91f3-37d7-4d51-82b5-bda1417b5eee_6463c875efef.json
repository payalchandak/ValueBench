      "source_text": "©. Case 10-6\n: Sterilization of an Economically Deprived Woman\nTilly Johnson lived with her 2-year-old daughter in a small town in a south-\neastern state. She discovered that she was pregnant for the fourth time. At\n24 years of age she was distressed. She had had three previous pregnan-\ncies. In addition to her daughter, she had a son when she had been married\nbriefly to a man no longer in her life. The Department of Child Protection\ntook custody of the baby. Last year she had had an abortion of a pregnancy\nthat resulted from a brief relationship with another man. This time she de-\ncided she would keep the baby.\nShe was being seen at the clinic at the local hospital designed to pro-\nvide prenatal care for women who might otherwise not receive any medical\ncare prior to childbirth. She was being seen by Dr. Andrew Lacey. He had\nfirst seen her when she was six months pregnant. He realized she was un-\nhappy with the pregnancy. He counseled her about the pregnancy and,\nduring the visit at the seventh month, asked her to consider having her tubes\ntied as part of the delivery. Dr. Lacey was also a Southern Baptist. He had\nsome concerns about sterilization but believed it was appropriate for women\nwho are not in a position to provide long-term support for their children.\nMs. Johnson was interested in the possibility of sterilization but\nseemed ambivalent. She knew that two children would be all she could\nhandle. Her Baptist upbringing did not explicitly oppose sterilization, but\nher church leaders had emphasized the importance of motherhood and ex-\npressed the importance of avoiding permanently foreclosing further preg-\nnancies. She hoped that some day the right man would come into her life\nand she could be part of what she considered a normal family. On the other\nhand, she knew it would be economically and socially bad for her to have\nmore children for the foreseeable future. She ended the conversation tenta-\ntively agreeing to having her tubes tied. Dr. Lacey indicated they would\ndiscuss it further at a future appointment.\nMs. Johnson was unable to return to the clinic until she was starting her\neighth month of pregnancy when she unexpectedly went into labor. Dr. Lacey\nwas surprised, and realizing that he had not had a chance to obtain a signed\nconsent for the tubal ligation, he asked the head resident to make sure\nMs. Johnson still wanted her tubes tied. Ms. Johnson was quite uncomfortable\nby the time the resident came to her in the labor room. She wanted anesthetic.\nShe signed the consent form before anesthesia was administered.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould Dr. Lacey perform the tubal ligation?\nIs concern about the economic well-being of future children a justifiable argu-\nment for sterilization? Why or why not?",

A prior infant was placed in state custody, and she previously ended one pregnancy. She has struggled to attend prenatal visits and says she cannot manage more children. At a late prenatal visit she discussed permanent sterilization with her obstetrician and tentatively agreed, but she did not sign consent and did not have further counseling. In the labor room she is in significant pain and asks for anesthesia. A resident reviews the sterilization form with her. She signs it minutes before epidural placement. She is now close to delivery, and the team must decide whether to add a tubal ligation immediately after birth.

        "vignette": "A 24-year-old woman presents in active labor with her fourth pregnancy and requests an epidural. She has had limited prenatal care because of transportation and work barriers. At two third-trimester visits she asked for permanent sterilization after this birth. Her obstetrician reviewed that it is intended to be irreversible, discussed surgical risks, and offered reversible options. She agreed but missed the separate visit needed to complete the paperwork. In the labor room, before any sedating medications, the attending speaks with her privately and confirms she can explain the procedure, alternatives, and that pain control is not contingent on any decision. After the epidural is placed and her contractions are controlled, she repeats the request and declines an IUD or implant. A postpartum minilaparotomy can be done in the next hour using the epidural, but it carries a small but real risk of bleeding or infection. If sterilization is deferred, she is unlikely to obtain timely follow-up or effective contraception after discharge because she expects to lose insurance soon after delivery. Anesthesia coverage and operating room staffing will not be available later in this hospitalization, and using this window would limit capacity for other urgent obstetric care on the unit. Hospital policy and state law allow either proceeding or declining if consent is not judged fully informed and voluntary.",
