You have spent the last week getting to know the area and\nsome of the other medical students who are also on attachment with you. Although you were\nfeeling relaxed you are now quite nervous about your first day in the hospital. On arrival the\nfirst thing you notice is how busy it is everywhere. Whole families are queuing outside a door,\nwaiting to see the doctor. Everyone is very subdued. Despite seeming exceptionally busy the\ndoctor in charge of paediatrics is extremely pleased to see you. After a brief introductory talk\nhe gives you a list of names and shows you to a big room. On one side a large group of mothers\nand their children are sitting on benches. On the other side are a desk and an examination\ncouch. He gives you a prescription pad and then waves goodbye. Nervously you call your first\npatient, a 5-year-old boy. His mother tells you in very stilted English that he has a sore throat\nand painful knees. Could this be rheumatic fever? You feel out of your depth but do not know\nwhat to do about it.\nQuestions\n• Should students follow the ethical guidelines that they would follow in their own\ncountry or do they not apply in the host country?\n• Do medical schools provide guidelines for their students?\n• What would you do in this situation?",

The senior pediatrician is in the operating theatre and cannot return for several hours. A 5-year-old boy is brought in by his mother, who speaks limited English. He has fever, sore throat, and painful swollen knees. The chart shows no prior records and the family traveled a long distance and says they may not be able to come back soon. The presentation could fit acute rheumatic fever, where early treatment may prevent serious heart damage, but the diagnosis is not certain and the boy’s allergy history is unclear. The only available treatment today is an intramuscular penicillin injection given on site. Hospital policy allows the physician to start treatment without on-site specialist review, but also supports deferring to the senior when feasible. A decision is needed before the family leaves.",

        "vignette": "A 5-year-old boy presents with two days of fever, sore throat, and new migratory pain and swelling in both knees. He is stable and drinks fluids. He limps and resists knee motion. You suspect streptococcal pharyngitis with possible evolving acute rheumatic fever. He does not clearly meet full criteria. Your clinic has no rapid strep test, labs, ECG, or echocardiography. The only antibiotic available is intramuscular benzathine penicillin. He is vomiting, so oral therapy is not feasible. His mother speaks limited English. She reports a prior antibiotic reaction as a toddler after penicillin, with hives and possible wheezing, but details are unclear. She wants to catch the family’s ferry in an hour and asks for treatment now. She is also hesitant and requests explanation through an interpreter. Epinephrine is available, but advanced resuscitation support is delayed while the OR team is scrubbed. The family may not return soon. Early treatment could reduce risk of rheumatic fever and later cardiac involvement. Policy and local law permit either course.",
