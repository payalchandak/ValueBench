All those\nwho provided antenatal care gave her information about the risks that this posed to her\nunborn child and urged her to stop drinking or significantly reduce her intake. Angela did\nnot do so, and her baby was born with foetal alcohol syndrome, which is characterised by\nintellectual disability and physical defects.\n\nJosephine was 8 weeks pregnant when her 3-year-old daughter was covered with red spots\nand diagnosed as having German measles. Josephine told her GP that she would want a ter-\nmination rather than risk giving birth to a disabled child. She had two blood tests but the\nresults were contradictory. The GP did not check with the laboratory nor did he run new\ntests. Instead he reassured her that all was well. In fact, Josephine gave birth to a boy who\nwas blind, deaf and severely brain damaged, which could be attributed to German measles\nexposure in utero.",

The lab can repeat testing, but the confirmatory result will take over a week. Medication abortion is available locally only through 10 weeks.

        "vignette": "A pregnant patient is 9 weeks 4 days gestation. Her 3-year-old was diagnosed with rubella last week. The patient now has a low-grade fever and a new maculopapular rash. She received MMR in childhood, but prior titers are unavailable. Initial serology is discordant. One report shows a weakly positive rubella IgM. Another shows strong IgG and notes IgM can be false-positive and may reflect past immunity. If this is primary rubella infection at 9–10 weeks, fetal risk of severe congenital rubella syndrome is substantial. A reference-lab avidity and PCR panel is available, but results take 10–14 days. Waiting would likely push her past the local clinic’s 10-week medication-abortion cutoff. After 10 weeks, abortion would be procedural and would require travel and family disclosure for transportation. She requests confirmatory testing before making an irreversible decision, but she also asks to preserve the option of early medication abortion if the risk appears meaningful. Hospital policy and state law support either approach. You must decide how to proceed today.",
