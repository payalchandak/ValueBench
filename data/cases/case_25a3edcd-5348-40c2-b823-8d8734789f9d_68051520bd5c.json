In accordance with hospital\npolicy, the patient provides verbal consent for the physician to speak\nwith his employer and disclose his health status. The employer\nproceeds to contact the physician directly by phone, requesting an\nupdate on the patient and his likelihood of returning to work.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate response by the physician\nto the employer?\na. \"I can confirm that the patient is currently hospitalized, and I anticipate he will\nbe able to return to work.\"\nb. \"I can disclose information to you only in the presence of the patient, so we\nneed to schedule a meeting.\"\nc. \"I cannot discuss a patient's care with anyone without a written signed release\nof information.\"\nd. \"I cannot verify your identity and therefore cannot disclose any information\nabout the patient.\"\ne. \"The diagnosis is alcoholic hepatitis and I expect him to recover and return to\nwork in the coming days.\"",
