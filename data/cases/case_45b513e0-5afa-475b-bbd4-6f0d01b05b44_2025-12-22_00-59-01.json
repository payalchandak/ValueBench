      "source_text": "Case i 2\nDwarfism: When Is a Fetus Normal?\nObstetrician Elizabeth Whistler asked for a bioethics consultation to con-\nsider the request of Charles and Amanda Harrelson for genetic testing and\na possible elective abortion. Mrs. Harrelson, who was pregnant for the first\ntime, was three months into an apparently normal pregnancy. She and her\nhusband were both achondroplastic dwarfs. They seemingly were finan-\ncially comfortable and well adjusted to their physical conditions. They had\nrequested testing of their developing fetus for evidence of achondroplasia.\nAchondroplastic dwarfism is a bone growth disorder in which carti-\nlage is not properly converted into bone. Adult males develop to an average\nheight of about four feet, four inches; females average about three inches\nshorter. While trunk size is normal, arms and legs are short and the head is\nenlarged, featuring a prominent forehead. Intelligence is generally normal.\nPhysical problems include bouts of apnea (periods in which breathing\nstops), obesity, bowed legs, and abnormalities of the lower back. Back pain\nis common in older people with the condition.\nThe condition results from a mutation in a single gene, the FGFR3\n(fibroblast growth factor 3) gene. It occurs once in every 15,000 to 40,000\nbirths, but if both parents have the gene, one child in four will inherit two\ncopies, which results in severe effects, usually stillbirth or death from re-\nspiratory failure soon after birth. One child in four will not inherit any copies\nand will not be affected. Two in four will inherit one copy and have dwart-\nism, the same characteristics as their parents.\nPrenatal diagnosis for the presence of the abnormal gene is now pos-\nsible. Since incidence is so rare, if neither parent has the condition, testing\nwould not normally be carried out. If both parents are affected, then testing\nwould become more plausible. Any fetus with two copies of the gene could\nbe aborted.\nDr. Whistler was discussing the diagnostic procedure with Mr. and\nMrs. Harrelson and helping them understand their options. It became ap-\nparent to her that their intention was to abort not only any fetus with two\ncopies of the gene but also any child with no copies. If the fetus was not\nachondroplastic, they would have the pregnancy aborted because they did\nnot want to rear a child obviously different from themselves.",
