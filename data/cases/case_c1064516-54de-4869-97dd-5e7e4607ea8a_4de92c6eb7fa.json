Angiography shows severe three-vessel coronary disease and markedly reduced left ventricular function. Cardiology recommends revascularization within days and is considering CABG versus less durable PCI as a bridge. He is hemodynamically stable on IV antianginal therapy, but pain recurs with weaning. Cardiothoracic coverage is limited this week. The only available surgeon says this high-risk CABG requires a second attending and a perfusion team comfortable with mechanical circulatory support. That staffing is not available here this week. OR leadership says reallocating those personnel would cancel or delay other urgent cardiac and ICU cases. No alternate surgeon can be credentialed in time. Transfer to a regional center can provide a full team, but acceptance and insurance authorization may take 48–72 hours and would separate him from nearby family. Risk management advises both pathways are permitted under hospital policy. You must decide today.",
