      "source_text": "The case of Emilia \nEmilia, aged four, had been brought to a child psychiatrist because she had regressed in her behaviour \nand speech. Since her parents separated, on the grounds of the husband’s alleged physical violence \nagainst his wife, Emilia had been living with her mother. However, she had seen her father on regular \naccess visits. \nClinical examination of Emilia revealed high risks \nof psychopathological disorders, but no current iden ti able pathology. Emilia’s mother was concerned \nthat the child’s condition was worsening, and she attributed the child’s problems to stress induced by \nfear of her violent father. She asked the psychiatrist to support her application for a court order discontinu- \ning the father’s access visits. The psychiatrist refused, stating that ‘It is part of the therapy to side with the \nchild rather than with either parent’. \nAfter an initial period during which Emilia regu- \nIarly attended therapy sessions, with reasonably good \nresults, the mother renewed her request to the psy- \nchiatrist for an expert opinion to back up her court \napplication. The psychiatrist again refused. There was \nno overt confrontation, but the mother stopped tak- \ning Emilia to the therapy sessions.",

Her parents recently separated after the mother reported physical violence by the father. The child has regular supervised visits with her father by an interim family-court plan. In sessions, the child is anxious and reenacts fighting themes in play, but she also talks about missing her father and wanting to show him drawings. No physical injuries are found, and there is no confirmed diagnosis beyond marked stress symptoms and developmental regression. The mother says the visits are worsening the child and asks the psychiatrist to write an expert letter supporting a motion to suspend contact. A hearing is scheduled next week, and she says she will stop therapy if the psychiatrist will not help.

        "vignette": "A 4-year-old girl is seen by a child psychiatrist for 2 months of new speech regression and daytime enuresis. Her parents recently separated after the mother reported prior intimate-partner violence; the details are contested and under court review. The parents share legal custody. The child has court-ordered, supervised visits with her father. The supervisor reports tearfulness at exchanges and worsening tantrums and nightmares after visits. In session, the child says she is scared at visits and reports that her father tells her not to talk about what happens there. She also asks to call him and says she misses him. The psychiatrist believes the visits may be driving the regression and enuresis, but there is no specific disclosure requiring a mandatory report. The mother requests a letter to pause visits and says she will end therapy if none is provided. The father objects. The judge will not accept a purely factual treatment letter and will likely rely on any clinician opinion despite no independent evaluation. Counsel confirms that sending a limited safety opinion or sending nothing is legally permissible. If a letter is sent, the father’s attorney will seek the full record, which could undermine treatment.",
