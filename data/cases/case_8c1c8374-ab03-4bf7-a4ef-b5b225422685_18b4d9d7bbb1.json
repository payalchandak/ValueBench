A crack and cocaine user, admitting\nto multiple sex partners, he was married and the father of one child. Exami-\nnation confirmed renal and/or heart failure, and lab studies determined he\nwas indeed in kidney failure. His diagnoses were terminal acquired im-\nmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), end-stage renal disease, chronic anemia,\nand possible bloodstream infection (sepsis).\nHe refused additional diagnostic procedures and blood transfusion.\n_ Antibiotic therapy was instituted. Generally, he was poorly compliant with\nmedical advice. He also had spells of crying and apparent depression. The\nphysicians assessed his mental competency as adequate for decision-\nmaking and discussed with him and his family options for advance direc-\ntives, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which he declined.\nHemodialysis was not offered as a treatment option because it would be of\n“no benefit to life expectancy.” (The nephrology consultant agreed.) After\nthree days of hospitalization, he was transferred to a hospice program.",

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old man with advanced AIDS is admitted for fever, profound cachexia, and progressive shortness of breath. He has severe kidney failure on chronic kidney disease with volume overload and rising potassium. IV diuretics, potassium binders, and dietary restriction have helped only partially. He is awake, consistent, and judged to have decision-making capacity. He has a documented DNR/DNI and has declined further invasive diagnostic testing and blood transfusion. Nephrology explains that intermittent hemodialysis is technically possible but requires immediate placement of a large central venous catheter and an ongoing schedule. They cannot offer a one-session or time-limited trial. After hearing this, he still requests dialysis to gain time and clarity to be home with his child, and hospice-only care would conflict with this preference. Dialysis may relieve uremic dyspnea and confusion, but it could cause hypotension, bleeding without transfusion backup, line infection, and ICU-level escalation he does not want. Without dialysis, he has high short-term risk of fatal arrhythmia and worsening uremia despite maximal medical therapy. Dialysis staffing is critically limited, and only one catheter and dialysis slot remain tonight under a triage policy prioritizing potentially reversible illness. A plan is needed before the slot closes.",
