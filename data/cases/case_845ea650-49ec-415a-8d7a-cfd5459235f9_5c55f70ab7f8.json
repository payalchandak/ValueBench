He fails to regain consciousness, although he does not require\nventilatory support. He receives fluids and parenteral nutrition for 11 days and is regularly\nvisited by his wife and two children.\nEventually, senior medical staff discuss with Tony’s family the extensive nature of damage to\nhis brain and the likelihood that he will never regain consciousness. The family is asked to\nconsider the possibility of withdrawing nutritional and fluid support and allowing Tony\nto die ‘naturally’. They are warned that this may take some time, as much as a couple of weeks,\nbut that Tony will not be in any pain.\nHis son approaches you, the FY1 doctor on the ward, during visiting hours and tells you that\nit is becoming increasingly distressing for his mother to watch her husband die and that, if\nthis is to be the inevitable result, why is it not possible to offer a quicker end to the family’s\nsuffering, such as an injection which would stop Tony’s heart.\nQuestions\n• What does an ‘act’ and an ‘omission’ mean in relation to end-of-life decisions?\n• What are the ethical arguments for and against the distinction between the two?\n• What is the legal position regarding acts and omissions?",
