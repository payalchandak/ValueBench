      "source_text": "Case 10-2\nPostcoital Contraception or Abortion: Moral Choices\nFollowing Rape\nTwenty-seven-year-old Daniela Sackler and her husband of four years were\nattempting to conceive their second child. Both were graduate students\ndoing research on doctoral dissertations. They had even arranged their\nschedules so that they could share in the child care and household respon-\nsibilities while they both went to school. Daniela was studying sociology\nand conducting interview research that required one-on-one two-hour in-\nterviews of young adults. She usually offered to conduct the interviews in\nthe homes of her research subjects. She had an interview schedule that had\nbeen approved by her university's institutional review board.\nOn a Tuesday evening she called on one of her subjects and initiated\nthe interview. After about an hour, the subject, who indicated his wife was\naway for the evening, offered her coffee, which she gratefully accepted.\nMs. Sackler noticed the subject became increasingly friendly. By the end of the\ninterview, the subject turned on a CD and asked her to dance, an invitation\nshe quickly refused, indicating she had to leave. At that point he blocked her\nexit and raped her.\nUpon returning home, she told her husband what had happened and\ncalled the police. She was taken to the hospital emergency room (ER). She\ntold the ER staff that she and her husband were trying to conceive a child\nso she was not taking her birth control pills. She was almost exactly at the\ntime of month at which conception would occur. In fact, if she had become\npregnant this month, she would have no way of knowing whether her hus-\nband or the research subject-turned-rapist was the father of the child. After\nexamination by the ER personnel, she was offered a “morning-after” pill in\ncase a conception had occurred.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n) What moral decisions does Ms. Sackler face regarding the “morning-after” pill?\nWhat moral decisions do members of the health care team face in the treat-\nment of a rape victim and the use of the “morning-after” pill?",

        "vignette": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the ED within hours of a reported sexual assault. She is not using contraception. Her chart documents that she would not take post‑coital contraception because she views it as ending a potential pregnancy. She is oriented, not intoxicated, and has no head injury. A urine pregnancy test is negative. She can explain that emergency contraception is time-sensitive and may cause nausea. Her attention and preferences fluctuate. During a lucid interval she repeats her moral objection and declines the medication. Minutes later she becomes dissociated, says an assault-related pregnancy would be devastating, and asks you to decide for her. As discharge approaches, you judge she lacks decision-making capacity due to ongoing dissociation. Her spouse confirms her prior stance but requests the medication. It is 3 AM. She plans to leave within 20 minutes. No advocate or psychiatry is available, and the ED cannot dispense emergency contraception to take later. Hospital counsel advises either course is legally permissible. You must decide before discharge.",
