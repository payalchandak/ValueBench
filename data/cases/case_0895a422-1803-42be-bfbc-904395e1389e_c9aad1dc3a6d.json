She has been told that this drug might cause multiple gestation. At 8 weeks gestation, ultrasound confirms the presence in utero of two fetuses, both of which appear healthy. One week later, the woman asks her physician to reduce the number of fetuses to one. Although the patient is informed that this procedure involves risk of losing the other fetus also, she persists in her request for FTPP, indicating that if this cannot be done, she will seek abortion of both fetuses, and try again for another pregnancy.",

She asks you to perform a procedure to reduce the pregnancy to a singleton. You explain that the procedure is not medically required and can result in losing the remaining fetus, infection, bleeding, or later pregnancy loss. She understands and repeats that she wants a singleton pregnancy. She adds that if reduction is not offered, she plans to pursue termination of the entire pregnancy elsewhere.
