        "vignette": "A 3-year-old girl returns to the ED with fever, flank tenderness, and persistent vomiting after being diagnosed with pyelonephritis yesterday at a pediatric clinic. The referral note says she was interactive, had stable vitals, tolerated a drink in the office, and the family had reliable transportation and next-day follow-up. She received an intramuscular antibiotic and started oral antibiotics at home. Overnight she worsened and now cannot keep down fluids or medication and appears clinically dehydrated. You are considering hospital admission for IV fluids, antiemetics, and IV antibiotics, but this requires parental consent now. Her parents ask whether anything was overlooked yesterday and say they need your advice to decide whether to consent to admission now. They say they may refuse or delay admission unless you can tell them whether yesterday’s outpatient plan was safe. The clinic is closed and the full outpatient record is not accessible. In your setting, unsubstantiated criticism of prior care can escalate blame, trigger formal complaints that affect the clinic’s ability to serve other families, and distract from urgent treatment. Clinicians may either share a professional opinion about prior care or decline to judge it during acute management.",
