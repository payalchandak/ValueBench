      "source_text": "Case 9-4\nClaire Conroy: Are Medically Supplied Nutrition\nand Hydration Expendable?\nIn 1983, after many years of medical problems, Claire Conroy was 84 years\nold. She had long suffered from organic brain syndrome and had been le-\ngally incompetent since 1979. She was a resident at Parklane Nursing Home\nin Bloomfield, NJ. Her nephew, Thomas Whittemore, was her only living\nrelative and her guardian. In July of 1982, her left foot was gangrenous and\namputation was recommended. Mr. Whittemore refused consent for the am-\nputation, claiming that Miss Conroy has always resisted medical involve-\nment. It is testimony to the evolution of the right of patients and their\nsurrogates to refuse medical treatment in the days since Karen Quinlan\nthat Mr. Whittemore’s right to refuse on these grounds was not challenged\nlegally even though the gangrene was a serious, possibly life-threatening\ncondition. While she was hospitalized in conjunction with the treatment of\nthe gangrene, medical personnel noticed that Miss Conroy was not receiv-\ning adequate nourishment and placed a naso-gastric (NG) tube to provide\nbetter nutrition. By 1983, when the case became public, she was totally de-\npendent on the tube for feeding.\nMiss Conroy had many other medical problems. In addition to the\nsevere organic brain syndrome, she had necrotic decubitus ulcers on her\nleft foot, leg, and hip, a urinary tract infection, hypertension, arterioscle-\nrotic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus and was unable to move except\nfor minor movements of her head, neck, and arms. She did not speak. She\nlay in a fetal position, only sometimes followed people with her eyes, and\nher general physical appearance was very withered. She moaned when\nmoved or touched. It was unclear whether she was capable of experiencing\npain. She showed no signs of cognitive or volitional functioning.\nUsing reasoning similar to that in defending the refusal of the amputa-\ntion, Mr. Whittemore now insisted that the NG tube be removed.\nThe doctors were reluctant to go along. They accepted the legitimacy of\nrefusing ventilators or amputations but considered provision of food and\nfluids as basic medical care, something they expected to provide to all\npatients who needed them.",

        "vignette": "An 84-year-old nursing home resident with severe chronic brain injury and profound cognitive impairment is admitted with a worsening sacral pressure injury and suspected soft-tissue infection. She is bedbound, nonverbal, and does not follow commands. She grimaces and vocalizes with repositioning. She sometimes appears calm with familiar voices. She has received long-term nutrition through a PEG tube after repeated aspiration with oral intake despite therapy. The PEG is now obstructed, and bedside unclogging has failed. Within 24 hours you must either exchange the tube or remove it, and the facility will not accept her back without a plan. Continued tube feeding could support antibiotics and wound care, but the ulcer is unlikely to heal fully and ongoing interventions may require transfers and mitts, which often cause distress. Exchanging the tube requires a procedure and carries risk of pain, bleeding, or misplacement. Removing the tube would shift to comfort-focused oral care and small tastes as tolerated. Intake would likely be inadequate and could lead to dehydration, aspiration, and a potentially prolonged dying process. She has no written directive. Her court-appointed nephew says she previously stated she would never want a feeding tube or artificial nutrition if she could not recognize others, and he is using substituted judgment. Another relative recalls her accepting prior hospital care. Hospital policy and state law permit either approach with guardian consent.",
