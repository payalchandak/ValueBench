He underwent thirteen operations that still left him\nso compromised that he would only go out with a surgical mask covering\nhis face. He lived the life of a recluse, not a functioning member of society.\nAfter 15 years, he became a candidate for the most extensive face\ntransplant surgery to date. On March 19 and 20, 2012, Norris underwent\n36 hours of operation at the Maryland Shock Trauma Center involving a\nteam of 150 physicians, nurses, and other staff. The operation replaced his\ntongue, teeth, and upper and lower jaw as well as facial skin tissue. Inci-\nsions ran from hair line to neck area, replacing damaged face with tissue\nprocured from an anonymous donor (who has since been identified as\n21-year-old Joshua Aversano, who was hit and killed by a minivan while\ncrossing a street).\nA year out from the surgical procedure, Norris is reportedly doing well,\nundergoing speech therapy, coping with one temporary rejection episode,\nand pleased that he is no longer the object of stares when he is out in\npublic.",

He tells you he is “tired of surviving” and wants a chance to eat, speak, and appear in public without a mask. Your center can offer a composite full-face transplant, and an immunologically suitable donor graft has become available with only a short window to accept it. The procedure would be very long and technically complex. It would require lifelong immunosuppression and close monitoring, with the possibility of rejection, serious infection, malignancy, or graft loss that could leave him worse off. Declining the graft avoids these risks but likely commits him to ongoing functional limits and further staged reconstructions. Hospital policy and state law permit either course.",
