A 30-year-old patient with a history of severe intimate partner violence is now separated from her partner but remains legally married and worries he is still monitoring her. She requests a complete printed copy of her medical record, including psychotherapy notes and detailed injury documentation, saying she wants it “for my own files and to understand what’s been written.” The health information office will release it if she insists, but staff raise concern that a hard copy could be found or coerced from her and used to harm her or worsen her safety; they ask whether you want to limit what is released or delay release until a safer plan is in place. The patient is calm, not intoxicated, and appears to understand the request, but becomes visibly upset when told anything might be withheld.",
