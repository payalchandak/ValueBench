      "source_text": "CASE 100:\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ILLNESS\nI was a final-year medical student when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the\nspace of 3 weeks I went from initial presentation at the general practitioner to disease diagno-\nsis, including grading and staging. Pretty impressive, considering this involved going for two\nconsultations (one with a hospital specialist), a blood test, chest X-ray, computed tomography\n(CT) scan, fine needle aspiration and biopsy under general anaesthetic. My world had been\nturned upside down.\nLooking back, the majority of those 3 weeks are a hazy memory. However, my first consulta-\ntion with the hospital specialist remains in my head, but for all the wrong reasons. Initially\nthere were no introductions, which meant I had no idea who anyone was. I remember there\nbeing another person in the room besides the doctor, my mother and myself. I assumed at\nthe time that she was a student nurse, but this is pure supposition based on my own experi-\nences as a student in outpatient clinics. I certainly was not asked whether I minded her being\npresent and she did not say or do anything to indicate that her being there was necessary. The\nconsultant appeared in a hurry and spent most of the consultation speaking to my mother\nabout everything that had happened, despite the fact that at 23, I was not only the patient, but\nalso a competent adult (and nearly qualified medical professional!).\nThe worst thing about the consultation was the provisional diagnosis. It was not broken to me\nin the way I would have expected. The consultant asked me what I thought was wrong with\nme. By that point, most differentials had been ruled out; the only one left was Hodgkin’s, yet\nstill I thought I was just being a hypochondriac. I made my suggestion and the consultant\nresponded, but not with the answer I’d been expecting: ‘Yes, I think it is Hodgkin’s too’. From\nthat point on, the rest of that consultation is a blur. I can’t remember any of the other informa-\ntion I was given; my mind had gone into overdrive and the only thing I could think was that I\nhad cancer and might die. A week later, after the diagnosis had been confirmed histologically,\nI went for CT staging. Again, I found this a terrifying experience. I was scared it might show\nthe cancer had already metastasised, but also of having the scan itself. Nobody had explained\nthe procedure to me – that I would need to be cannulated and have intravenous contrast\ninjected. By the time I got into the CT scanner, I was hysterically upset. A form was thrust\nat me, which I was asked to sign. To this day I have no idea what I signed for, whether it was\nto consent to the scan, confirm I didn’t have any allergies to iodine/ shellfish or to confirm\nI wasn’t pregnant.\nDespite having spent 2 years on hospital ward as a student, being an inpatient while I received\nchemotherapy was a completely different experience. It made me really think about what my\nown patients must have been going through. There are things that you don’t appreciate as\na student (and perhaps even as a junior doctor). Privacy was a big problem. I was paranoid\nabout sleeping since everyone would see me and possibly hear me snore. I was constantly\ntired as the nurses are always coming to do observations or give drugs. Machines bleeping\nconstantly were also a huge annoyance! I was also always asked about how I was feeling and\nabout my intimate bodily functions in front of an entire ward of patients and relatives. It was\nalso very lonely being a patient; I would see doctors on their rounds for less than 10 minutes\nand then speak to no one till visiting hours in the afternoon.\nI spent 6 months as a patient, and thankfully now I’m a doctor. But my experience was\nmore valuable than any lectures or clinics, since it made me think a lot about the way we treat\nour patients.\nQuestions\n• Should I have been treated quicker just because I am a medical professional?\n• Should the consultant have assumed I knew what all the investigations and treat-\nments involved?\n• Is informed consent ever possible when a patient is scared? Or in pain? Or in emer-\ngency situations?\n\n10 years later … An update\nTen years on and I still reflect on my own personal experience as a patient. I have no doubt\nthat it strongly influenced my career choice, as I now specialie in palliative medicine. I rec-\nognise and accept that unfortunately, despite our best efforts as medical professionals, some-\ntimes patients die. In a strange way, I think being forced to confront my own mortality has\nenabled me to reconcile the fact that patients die too. Being able to ease patients’ suffering\nand support them and their families at such a difficult time is both rewarding and extremely\nhumbling.\nWhat I learnt through personal experience is echoed time after time by the patients I care for.\nPatients value honesty and clear and timely communication from the medical team. Lack of\ninformation leads to a sense of loss of control and a negative patient experience. In any medi-\ncal condition, the patient has already lost a degree of control, so anything a doctor can do to\nimprove that perception is welcomed by patients.\nSometimes ‘being alongside’ the patient is enough. You may not have all the answers and you\nmay not be able to solve their problem or cure their illness, but being there for the patient and\nlistening to them goes a very long way, and often doesn’t take up as much of your time as you\nthink it will.\nKindness is one of the most valuable clinical skills you have. Patients appreciate empathy; if\nyou treat every patient as you would wish a close relative to be treated, then it’s difficult to go\nfar wrong.\nOne of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that the human spirit is amazing. Even in the face\nof adversity, people can show great strength and resilience. Patients can teach us a lot, not\njust about medicine, but also about life itself. As health professionals, we are very privileged\nindeed to be able to do the job we do.",
