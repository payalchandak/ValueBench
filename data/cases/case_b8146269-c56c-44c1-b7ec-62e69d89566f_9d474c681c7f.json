Mr. Younis\nwas known at the hospital for alcohol dependence, with cirrhosis of the\nliver. Examination revealed liver enlargement including a mass that was\nconfirmed with a computed tomography (CT) scan. He was admitted to the\nhospital, and a biopsy of the mass was scheduled. Mr. Younis’s mental\nstatus improved; his wife requested that he not be told if the diagnosis was\nmalignant. Mrs. Younis said that if he learns he has cancer, he will kill\nhimself. Dr. Andre Caldarone, the hepatologist (liver specialist), then can-\nceled the biopsy procedure.",

You have not observed suicidal statements in the hospital, but he has been intermittently tearful and sleep-deprived.
