      "source_text": "CASE 52:\nPERSONAL IDENTITY\nMelissa, a 30-year-old woman, had always been hard-working and conscientious but had\noften doubted her abilities and worried about her performance at school, university and\nwork. She was shy and nervous in new situations. She had suffered from depressive episodes\nsince her final year at university and had counselling on various occasions, which she found\nhelpful. Recently, in the space of a few months, she was promoted to a stressful position\nat work, her mother died unexpectedly, and her boyfriend of 4 years left her having met\nsomeone else. She felt permanently tired, lacking in motivation and enthusiasm, and was\napt to burst into tears at the slightest provocation. She sought psychiatric help, was diag-\nnosed with depression and was prescribed a course of antidepressant medication. Melissa\nresponded well to the medication and stopped feeling tired and unhappy and unable to\ncope. She stopped worrying about her abilities and her performance at work and found her\njob much more enjoyable. Where previously she had felt shy or nervous in new situations,\nshe felt more confident and convinced of her own ability to contribute.\nSometime after the course of medication finished, Melissa found herself returning to her\nprevious state. She was less self-confident and more concerned about whether her abilities\nwere adequate for the job she had to do. She was not prone to crying or permanently tired as\nshe had been when the medication was prescribed, but she felt shy and nervous and unable to\nexpress herself as fully as she had done when on the medication. She felt lacking in motiva-\ntion and ‘flat’.\nEventually, Melissa asked her psychiatrist whether she could be prescribed the medication\nagain, saying that it was only when on the medication that she had felt her true self. She now\nrealised that the shy, nervous worrier she had previously been was not really her at all, and\nshe wanted to give her real self the chance to come through again.\nQuestions\n• Should Melissa have been given medication in the first instance, given that she had\npreviously found non-pharmacological treatment for her depressive episodes to be\nsuccessful?\n• Should she be prescribed the medication again?\n• What does it mean to say that one has a ‘true’ or ‘real’ self, and to say that one’s real\nself can only be expressed with the aid of medication?",
