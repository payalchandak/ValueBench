No advance directive, POLST, or registered health care proxy is found in the chart or with EMS. The team calls the numbers in his phone, contacts his listed primary care office, and requests police assistance for a welfare check to locate family; after 2 hours no legal surrogate is reached, and neurosurgery states the optimal surgical window will close in the next 1–2 hours.\n\nA bedside nurse reports that during a prior admission for pneumonia, the patient said, “If I can’t recognize my family, don’t keep me on machines.” A longtime neighbor who arrived with him says that after the patient’s wife died, he remarked, “If I can still think, try to keep me alive—don’t give up on me.” These statements point toward different choices (avoiding prolonged life support versus pursuing life-prolonging treatment despite disability).",
