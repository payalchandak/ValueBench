The Baltimores certainly\ndid not live hand-to-mouth. They managed fairly well on Mr. Baltimore's\nconstruction worker's salary and what Mrs. Baltimore could make as a sub-\nstitute teacher. They were shocked when they learned that at 41, Mrs. Balti-\nmore was pregnant again. They were further shocked when after a routine\namniocentisis they learned from the obstetrician, Sandra Benton, that the\nfetus had Down syndrome.\nThis was particularly distressing to Mrs. Baltimore because her step-\nsister had Down syndrome too. Mrs. Baltimore had firsthand knowledge of\nwhat it meant to live in a family who had someone with this diagnosis. She\nknew that there would probably be multiple operations, hospital stays, and\nmedications since the fetus showed signs of significant cardiac problems\nas well. She had watched her stepsister suffer after each admission to the\nhospital. What made it worse is that her stepsister could not make any\nsense out of all of the trauma even as she reached an age when a “normal”\nperson would have appreciated why the treatment and surgery was neces-\nsary. She also knew about the sacrifices that the whole family would have\nto make for many years to come to accommodate the needs of this child.\nShe watched her stepmother and father struggle with her stepsister’s care\neven though she was now in her late thirties. Given all of this, the Balti-\nmores thought they just could not put this child or their family through it.\nTerminating the pregnancy seemed like the best course of action.",

        "vignette": "A 41-year-old G2P1 is 19 weeks pregnant by ultrasound dating. Amniocentesis confirms trisomy 21. Fetal echocardiography shows a complex congenital heart defect. It would likely require neonatal surgery and ongoing cardiology care if the pregnancy continues. Long-term disability is uncertain. She previously helped care for a family member with trisomy 21. She recalls frequent medical visits and major caregiver strain. She requests termination of pregnancy but also expresses moral distress. She says she wants her longtime obstetrician involved in whatever happens. You have no medical contraindication to termination, but you have a deeply held objection to participating in it. The only local clinic that can perform termination at this gestational age will stop scheduling in 7 days. Even with same-day transfer, insurance authorization and limited intake slots make a same-week appointment very unlikely. If she misses the cutoff, she may be forced to continue the pregnancy or seek a later, higher-risk procedure. Hospital policy and state law allow either providing the service or declining with prompt transfer of care.",
