Sara is a 30-year-old woman who dropped out of college after she found that she contracted HIV from her husband, who has hemophilia. In talking to Sara, it turns out that the medical student and the patient shared a number of things--both are from the same part of Montana originally, also have young children, and like to cook. Sara now has advanced HIV.\nHow should the medical student tell Sara about the advanced HIV and that she will need some blood tests without making her angry or upset?\na. The medical student should follow the protocol for breaking bad news because it covers everything.\nb. The medical student should tell Sara about the advanced HIV and the need for blood tests and not be concerned about provoking a reaction.\nc. The medical student should get another perspective perhaps from someone in clinic who has known Sara before breaking the bad news.\nd. None of the above.",

        "vignette": "A 30-year-old woman with known HIV returns after years without care. She has oral candidiasis and unintentional weight loss. She is afebrile and comfortable. She denies dyspnea, severe headache, focal neurologic symptoms, or confusion. Faxed records show prior advanced immunosuppression with a CD4 count below 50 and panic attacks after distressing medical discussions, including an ED visit. She arranged childcare for one hour and asks you not to discuss prognosis or “how bad it is” today. She says she will not agree to blood draws unless you explain in detail what tests could show and what the results would mean, even if that discussion increases her anxiety. Baseline staging labs today would guide ART timing, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and urgent screening for occult infections such as cryptococcal disease. Delaying labs for several days could postpone this planning and miss a treatable complication. The clinic social worker can meet with her only in 72 hours, which may reduce panic and improve follow-up. Hospital policy allows either proceeding today or deferring with documented refusal.",
