One of your patients, Taz, is a diabetic suffering from heart\nfailure. As listed on the drug chart, you give Taz his evening dose of insulin, but you forget\nto record this on the drug chart. You hand over to the night team. During the night shift the\npatient receives another insulin dose as the night staff thought this had not been done. The\nfollowing day Taz complains to you that he had a terrible night. He explains how he sweated\nprofusely, felt dizzy and endured headaches, all of which are signs of hypoglycaemia. You\nrealise your error when you look at the drug chart. You tell your consultant, who advises that\nyou should fill out an incident form.\nQuestions\n• What should you tell Taz?\n• Are NHS trusts under any obligations to be open and honest when mistakes\nare made?\n• What is the purpose of an incident form?\n• What happens to the form once it has been completed?",
