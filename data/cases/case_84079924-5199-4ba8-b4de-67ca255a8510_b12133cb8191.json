      "source_text": "The case of JW \nJW was a 12-year-old boy who had cystic fibrosis. \nSince his condition had been diagnosed JW had \nbeen visiting the same hospital and physicians regu- \nIarly for many years. Both he and his family were well \nknown to the staff there and enjoyed a good relation- \nship with them. In recent months, however, the boy’s \ncondition had become very serious. He had devel- \noped extensive varices of the oesophagus which \nbrought with them an accompanying risk of serious \nbleeding which would put the boy’s life in danger. \nWhen the doctor informed the family that the \nseriousness of the boy’s condition might require a \nblood transfusion in order to save his life, both the \nboy and his family refused to consider such an option \nbecause of their faith. For the whole family were \ndevout and active Jehovah’s Witnesses. \nThe paediatricians involved in the case disagreed \nabout how they ought to proceed and asked a child \npsychiatrist to assess the child’s competence to make \nthe decision to refuse treatment. One possible option \nwhich was considered was to make an application for \na court order to take custody of the boy away from his \nparents in order to allow the transfusion to take place. \nThe psychiatrist reported that the boy was intelli- \ngent and sensitive, that he was in no sense emotion- \nally or socially disturbed and that he had a good \nrelationship with his parents. He also had a clear \nunderstanding of his illness and of the treatment \nand was conscious of the consequences of his deci- \nsions to refuse a blood transfusion. He stuck to his \ndecision and said that his parents had exerted no \npressure on him. He simply wanted to live according \nto the principles of his faith. \nAfter interviewing the parents as well, it seemed \nclear that they cared very much for their son and \nindeed for all of their children. On the whole they \nwere rational about the decision to refuse the trans- \nfusion and appeared, as the boy himself had said, not \nto have put any explicit pressure on the boy to refuse \nthe treatment.",
