      "source_text": "The case of Sean\nSean is 15 years old. He lives at home with his\nparents and a sister who is 12. His father is a senior\ncivil servant and his mother is a healthcare profes-\nsional. They live in a small town in an a uent part\nffl\nof Ireland.\nfi\nWhen Sean s father rst made contact with the\n’\ntherapist he said that he was looking for help for his\n‘\nson because the boy seemed to have a chip on his\n’ ’\nshoulder and was always in trouble. He said that he\nhad persuaded Sean to see someone. They arrived\ntogether for the rst session but Sean was seen on his\nfi\nown.\nSean was anxious and uncomfortable, uncertain\nwhy he was there. He felt that he was being blamed\nfor the tension that existed between his parents. It\nfl\nseemed that there had always been con ict between\nfather and son; when Sean was younger he was fre-\nquently beaten for what he saw as minor misdemean-\nfi\nours. He said that his father would hit rst and\n‘ ’\npossibly listen later. Sean felt that he could not rely on\n’\nhis mother to protect him from his father s anger.\nSean had harboured fantasies for at least the last six\nyears of getting his own back by beating his father.\nHe also constantly talked about wanting to be away\nfrom home.\nSean says that he has always felt that he is not\ngood enough, that he has not achieved enough and\nis a disappointment to his parents. The transition\nffi\nfrom junior to senior school was a di cult one for\nSean. In the senior school he associated with the boys\nff\nin his class who smoked and took time o school. He\nfelt that one teacher in particular was against him,\nbecause he constantly reprimanded and punished\nSean for being cheeky. Two years ago there was a\ndisagreement between Sean and the teacher during\nwhich Sean hit the teacher. Sean was then expelled\nfrom school.\nHis parents were very angry with him and imme-\ndiately sent him away to boarding school. Sean was\nvery distressed and refused to go but he was forcibly\nfi\ntaken to the school and left there. In the rst few\nweeks he was bullied by the other boys and ran\naway. He was apprehended by the police and\nreturned to school where he continued to be sub-\njected to frequent beatings. A little later he ran away\nagain and managed to avoid being found by hiding in\na derelict building. He then returned home, where he\n’\nwas surprised by his parents acceptance that he did\nnot want to return to the boarding school. Instead he\nwas to attend as a day boy at a school nearby. Since\nfl\nthen there had been no further con ict at the school\nhe does attend.\nDisagreements continue at home, however. Sean\nfeels that his parents, his father in particular, are con-\nstantly spying on him. He is never allowed to be in the\nhouse on his own. Sometimes he is allowed to go out\nwith his friends, but sometimes this is refused. He has\nfi\ncontinued to get into ghts with other youths in the\ntown and on one recent occasion was seriously\nfi\nassaulted. He feels bitter that his father did not nd\nthe youth and beat him up. He is nervous when he\ngoes into town and recently has started to drink very\nlarge amounts of alcohol. This has caused more argu-\nments at home, but Sean feels that his father has\nbeen hypocritical because he also drinks heavily on\noccasion.\nSean is confused about why he should need to\nsee a therapist. He feels that his father is the cause of\nffl\nall his problems and is trying to o oad the blame\nonto him. Sean s father wants his son to settle down\n’\nto work at school so that he can go to university. He\n’\nfeels frustrated and angry about his son s behaviour\n‘ ’\nand hopes that a few sessions with the therapist will\nsort him out .",

He describes years of harsh discipline at home and ongoing fights with his father. He has been drinking heavily on weekends and was recently assaulted in town. He admits he often imagines “getting even” with his father and has been in fights with other youths, but he denies a specific plan to hurt anyone. He asks for therapy that his parents cannot access and says he will stop coming if they are contacted.
