He complained of cramping pain in his legs and intermittent limping.\nThe physician, Susan Therapides, suspected a block in his abdominal\naorta and recommended translumbar aortography to locate the block. She\nneeded to inject a dye, sodium urokon.\nDr. Therapides knew that this was a procedure that exposed the pa-\ntient to some risk. The injection could cause an anaphylactic response\nand, in rare cases, paralysis or even death. The standard procedure called\nfor informing the patient of these risks and obtaining a written consent for\nthe test. But Dr. Therapides was concerned about getting the consent. The\npatient was very frightened about his condition, he was apprehensive and\nhad serious heart disease with hypertension. Dr. Therapides came to the\nethics committee with the problem. She argued, “If you frighten him fur-\nther, you have a problem that you have created. If I mention the risk of\nparalysis to him, I think it might be a terrible mistake.” She claimed that\nshe should have a “therapeutic privilege” to omit getting the consent for\nthe procedure.",

The test carries uncommon but serious complications, including severe allergic reaction, neurologic injury, and death, alongside more routine risks.

        "vignette": "A 55-year-old man with severe cardiomyopathy, an ICD, and recurrent ventricular arrhythmias has rapidly worsening leg pain that now occurs at rest. Vascular surgery suspects critical aortoiliac occlusive disease with limb-threatening ischemia. Catheter-based aortography is planned this afternoon, with possible same-day endovascular treatment if anatomy allows. This is expected to meaningfully reduce pain and help prevent tissue loss and amputation. During pre-procedure discussion he becomes tremulous and tachycardic, and telemetry shows runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The chart documents prior detailed risk discussions that precipitated sustained VT with ICD shocks requiring acute treatment, while brief high-level consent discussions have not triggered arrhythmias. He is alert and oriented and can repeat back information, but he alternates between demanding that every material risk be explained in detail before he agrees and saying he cannot tolerate details and wants you to decide. Minimal sedation is planned only after consent; giving it before consent could blunt participation and recall. CTA is avoided due to kidney dysfunction, MRI is not possible with his device, and duplex is unlikely to define treatable anatomy. The angiography suite is only available today, and the next slot may be weeks away. Hospital policy permits either full disclosure or narrowly limited disclosure when immediate serious harm from disclosure is expected and documented.",
