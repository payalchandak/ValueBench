        "vignette": "A 16-year-old comes to your school-based clinic alone after a positive pregnancy test. A dating ultrasound confirms a very early first-trimester pregnancy. She requests an abortion referral and asks that her parents not be told. On brief assessment she is oriented and can describe the procedure, alternatives, and follow-up in her own words. She says the decision is hers. She shows repeated texts from a boyfriend telling her what to say, and she becomes guarded when you ask about him, so you cannot fully establish voluntariness. When asked about support, she cannot name any adult who could drive her, stay with her afterward, or be a reliable same-day contact. She says her parents have brought her for medical care before, but she fears severe punishment if they learn about the pregnancy. Under state law and hospital policy, she can consent to confidential abortion care without parental involvement. The abortion clinic has limited early-gestation appointment slots, and delaying referral could push her past the medication-abortion option she prefers. A brief delay could allow safety screening for coercion or abuse and planning for confidential transportation and post-procedure monitoring. Your clinic social worker is unavailable until next week, and the abortion clinic needs a referral today to offer a timely appointment.",
