Tocolytics and steroids are started, but contractions continue and delivery appears imminent. The fetus has been growing appropriately and ultrasound is reassuring. She has had four prior mid-trimester pregnancy losses and says she “cannot lose another baby.” The neonatal team explains that survival at this gestational age is uncertain and that infants who survive often face prolonged intensive care with painful procedures and serious long-term impairment. The patient and her spouse ask the physician to “do everything,” but they also fear causing suffering for a baby who might not survive. Hospital policy and state law permit either full resuscitation or comfort-focused care at this gestational age when parents are informed. A decision is needed before delivery.",
