        "vignette": "A 45-year-old man with severe COPD presents to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress. He has been admitted monthly for the past year with exacerbations, each requiring intensive respiratory support and prolonged ED stays. The nursing staff reports that he frequently leaves against medical advice once stabilized, continues smoking, and misses all outpatient follow-up appointments. Tonight, the ED is operating beyond capacity with a 6-hour wait for beds, and multiple patients with acute respiratory complaints are waiting to be seen. The patient requires continuous nebulizer treatments and close monitoring that will occupy a treatment bay and significant nursing time for many hours. The attending physician must decide how to allocate resources. She could provide the full intensive support this patient needs, knowing it will substantially delay care for others in the waiting room, or she could provide abbreviated stabilization and attempt to discharge him early to free up capacity for other patients, though this carries risk of deterioration and readmission within hours.",
