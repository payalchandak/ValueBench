Two days ago, she met with a research investigator and signed consent to join a blinded drug trial aimed at slowing memory decline.

Today she is calm but cannot recall the study and says, “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” when you mention starting the first dose tomorrow. Her daughter visits daily but was not present for the consent visit and has not been asked to decide. The study requires extra blood draws and monitoring, and the investigational drug has uncertain side effects in frail elders. The research team says her enrollment slot and drug shipment will be released if dosing does not start tomorrow.
