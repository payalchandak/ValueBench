      "source_text": "CASE 87:\nDOCTORS AND DVLA REGULATIONS\nFabian is a 38-year-old taxi driver who is admitted to A&E following a collapse. He was at\nhome with his wife and son when he ‘fell to the floor and just started shaking’. He has no\nmemory of the event and does not recall feeling strange beforehand. A collateral history is\ntaken from his wife who describes the collapse as sudden with all of his body jerking. She\nsays it lasted about a minute ‘but felt like a lifetime’. There is no history of tongue biting or\nincontinence and he recovered spontaneously, although he felt a little drowsy afterwards.\nNothing like this has happened before and there is no history of epilepsy in the family. He\ndid, however, start taking a new drug called Pellidron for his headaches 3 days ago. Fabian\nhas a history of headaches, oesophagitis and mild depression. He does not smoke and drinks\nabout 20 units a week. He is taking omeprazole 20 mg daily and citalopram 20 mg daily, and\nhe says he takes a baby aspirin as his brother, aged 47, recently had a myocardial infarction.\nHe does not have any known allergies.\nQuestions\n• Can Fabian continue to drive because he has only had one unexplained seizure?\n• Is there a legal requirement to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency\n(DVLA) of Fabian’s seizure?\n• Is there a legal requirement to tell his employer?",

His partner describes a sudden fall with whole-body jerking for about a minute and brief confusion afterward. He remembers nothing. This is his first event. Workup is still in progress, and he started a new headache medication three days ago that could lower the seizure threshold. He is medically stable and wants to go home now. He says he must drive tomorrow to avoid losing income, and he asks that no one be told because he fears his license will be suspended.
