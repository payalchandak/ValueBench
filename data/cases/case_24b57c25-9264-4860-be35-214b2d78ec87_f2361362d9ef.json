When you went home for a weekend to escape from\nthe hospital, your brother-in-law asks you to give him some advice on his hayfever. You felt\nable to do this so you made some suggestions. Your aunt then asked you about her arthritis\nand whether you could prescribe her some extra pain relief. Later that day your grandparents\ncome to visit. Your grandma confides in you that she is worried about the number of times\nyour grandpa is getting up to go to the toilet in the night. She wants some reassurance that\nthis is normal.\nQuestions\n• What should a doctor do when a friend or relative asks for medical advice?\n• Can a doctor write a prescription for a friend?",

The next available local appointment is weeks away, and he plans to drive home early tomorrow. Your grandmother is anxious and asks you to “just give him something tonight” so he can sleep and avoid an emergency room visit.

He reports mild suprapubic pressure but can still pass urine. He denies fever, dysuria, flank pain, gross hematuria, nausea, or confusion. He brought his pill bottles and a pharmacy app list. He takes an antihypertensive and has had occasional lightheadedness when standing. He asks for a medication tonight to avoid urgent care and says he does not want an in-person evaluation before driving home early tomorrow. You are not his treating clinician. You can check vitals, do a brief abdominal exam, and run a home urine dipstick, but you cannot measure a post-void residual, send labs or culture, or access his records. A short trial of tamsulosin might ease obstruction symptoms but could worsen his orthostatic symptoms and increase fall or syncope risk. Waiting could allow progression to acute urinary retention or obstructive kidney injury, or miss infection or malignancy. Prescribing for a close relative would bypass usual triage and oversight, while requiring evaluation applies the same standard process as for other patients. Hospital policy and state regulations permit either approach here. You must decide tonight.",
