        "vignette": "In the medical ICU, a 58-year-old man with severe COPD was intubated for hypercapnic respiratory failure. Over the past day he has become awake, can write clearly, and repeatedly refuses further sedation or physical restraints, saying he feels panicked and “trapped.” He is not yet meeting criteria for a safe extubation, and the team believes he will likely need the ventilator a bit longer, but he has been tugging at the endotracheal tube and tells staff he will pull it out if they do not remove the restraints. A bedside capacity assessment finds him oriented and able to explain that removing the tube now could lead to dangerous breathing problems and an emergency re-intubation. The ICU attending must decide how to respond.",
