  "comments": "as in at least one other case, the problem here is that this is not the standard of care. individuals with chronic illness need to have advanced directives as part of competent clinical care. that doesn't, of course, solve all problems because of the gray areas around stated wishes and prognosis. that is where this case needs to fall. this is not realistic in 2025 in the US. can reframe the case a bit to keep it ambiguous but at least recognize that the conversations have happened and there is some prior expressed wish (or not -- ie in previous conversations patient would not execute an advanced directive and said he'd figure out and know what to do when the time came)",
