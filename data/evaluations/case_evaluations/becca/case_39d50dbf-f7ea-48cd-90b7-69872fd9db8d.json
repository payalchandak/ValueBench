  "comments": "the case is a bit outdated, these cases in practice now often revolve around safety of PICC line and discharge rather than inpatient care, but that is probably ok. The legal issues and capacity determination could be clarified -- e.g. EMTALA doesn't apply after admission, medical holds vary legally in differnt jurisdictions and may not always be available -- prevent patient from leaving AMA due to lack of capacity and need for a surrogate decision-maker might be clearer.",
