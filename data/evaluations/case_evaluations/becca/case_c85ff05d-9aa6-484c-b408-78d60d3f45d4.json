  "comments": "someone with chronic lung disease and a prolonged ICU stay, not to mention 2, should have an advance directive or some prior directive on file to avoid this. the ethical and clinical lapse is not meeting the standard of care for making future decisions -- so there needs to be some mention of prior views or a longstanding physician here -- even if that guidance is not as directive as would be hoped. A vague directive as in a prior case.  choice 2 does not violate autonomy if the patient does not have capacity.",
