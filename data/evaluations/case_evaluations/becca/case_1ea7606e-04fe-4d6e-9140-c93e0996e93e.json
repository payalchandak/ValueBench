  "comments": "the answer here is to open up a discussion. even more, the law may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so would be helpful to have a default rule for mature minor specified in the case, e.g., the legal age of consent is 16 ... although some states may allow consent at 16 but access to medical record by parents until 18 so important to clarify.  clincially, would be better if there is an assessment of the patient's understanding of the risks and benefits of treatment escalation and how long-term debilitating those would be, e.g. reversible or irreversible and time course.",
