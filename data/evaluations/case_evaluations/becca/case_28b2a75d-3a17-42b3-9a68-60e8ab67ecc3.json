  "comments": "this case is like the first case I reviewed. I don't think that any individual clinician would or should be in the position of making a decision about resource allocation for their individual patient compared to other patients -- i highly doubt that any individual clinician would think about justice to other pateints. that's one of the problems in the US system -- maybe it's different elsewhere. The reasoning in this case should center on the likely negative risk-benefit ratio of undergoing surgery vs available palliative conservative management +/- justice consideration. would be important to vary the risk/ benefit against justice to see where the benchmarking falls.",
