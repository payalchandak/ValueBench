  "comments": "I don't think what the patient wants re blood products is the relevant issue here.  your clinical assessment of the need for the blood is what should carry. this case could be more fully elucidated to bring out values assumptions of intervention vs futility. For example, to highlight the issue of scarcity and futility and resouce allocation, what about -- realistically the only hope of saving the patient is to immediately transfuse the blood and then hope to get her to the OR in time to stop further bleeding ... or realistically the only hope of saving the patient is to immediately transfuse and transfer hoping it will stablitze her enough to get to a higher-resourced hospital. in either scenario, give some estimated probability of success.  E.g. without transfusing the blood, the patient will nearly certainly die and she has expressly stated a desire to live. Given her underlying comorbidities and illness, she has at best a small chance of survival with transfusion and transfer (or transfusion and OR).you..",
