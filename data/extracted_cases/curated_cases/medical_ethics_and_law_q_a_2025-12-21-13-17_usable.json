    "case": "1. You are a resident in the emergency department. An irate parent comes to you furious because the social worker has been asking him about striking his child. The child is a 5-year-old boy who has been in the emergency department four times this year with several episodes of trauma that did not seem related. Today, the child is brought in with a child complaint of “slipping into a hot bathtub” with a bum wound on his legs. The parent threatens to sue you and says “How dare you think that about me? I love my son!”\nWhat should you do?\na. Admit the child to remove him from the possibly dangerous environment.\nb. Call the police.\nc. Ask the father yourself if there has been any abuse.\nd. Explain to the parents that the next time this happens you will have to call child protective services.\ne. Report the family to child protective services.\nAnswer: (e) Report the family to child protective services.\nComment: Although, in general, it is better to address issues directly with patients and their families, this is not the case when you strongly suspect child abuse. Reporting of child abuse is mandatory even based on suspicion alone. Although it is frightening to be confrontational with the family, the caregiver is legally protected even if there turns out to be no abuse as long as the report was made honestly and without malice.\nYou do not have the authority to remove the child from the custody of the parents. Only child protective services or the courts can do that. The police would be appropriate for an assault happening at that exact moment, but the police are not appropriate to investigate child abuse. When you have a suspicion of child abuse, it doesn’t matter what the parents say. That is why talking directly to the mother or father is incorrect. When you suspect abuse, even if the family denies it, you must still report.",

You are working at the desk in your hospital when another employee of the hospital asks for information about a patient who was admitted last night with a pulmonary embolus secondary to cancer. You know the details of the case. The person requesting the information states that he is a close friend and co-worker of your patient. He shows you proper identification proving he really is a co-worker of your patient who also works in the hospital.\nWhich of the following is the most appropriate response to this request?\na.

Inform him that you are not at liberty to give details regarding the patient without the patient’s permission.\nd. Have him sign a release or consent form before revealing the information.\nAnswer: (c) Inform him that you are not at liberty to give details regarding the patient without the patient’s permission.\nComment: Confidentiality is a fundamental right of all patients. As part of maintaining the patient’s autonomy in revealing information only to those they wish to be informed of their condition you must refuse to release any specific information of the patient’s medical history or current medical problems without direct permission from the patient. Respect this right even if the person asking is, indeed, a co-worker—or even their superior. You have no idea if medical information may be used to discriminate against the patient. Separate from this, third parties have no automatic right to a patient’s medical information unless they are directly involved in the care of the patient. This would hold true even if the person seeking information is a health-care worker if they are not directly involved in the care of the patient. Have the patient— not the person requesting the information—sign the consent form for release of information confirming that they are giving you permission to release information.",

They ask to look at the patient’s chart for a few minutes, saying, “You wouldn’t want to interfere with a federal investigation, would you?”\nWhat should you do?\na. Give them the chart.\nb.

This is true no matter who is asking. If the federal agents have a court order for the records then they have a right to the information. A court order, warrant, or subpoena can be used by the judicial system to violate confidentiality if the judicial system sanctions the violation. Although the medical record as a physical object is the property of the physician or health-care facility, the information is the property of the patient. In a sense, the information is like a person’s house. No one has the right to enter your home without either your permission or a court order allowing the investigation. This is also true even if the people requesting it are law enforcement agents. We all have a constitutional right against illegal search and seizure of our property.",

The family asks that you inform them first about the results of the biopsy. They are very loving and caring and are constantly surrounding the patient. They do not want to depress the patient further, and because there will be no hope for a cure they see no reason to ruin her remaining life with this information.\nWhat should you tell them?\na.

You tell them that you are obligated to inform the patient of all the findings.\ne.

Unless there is significant evidence of possible psychological harm to a patient, you have an absolute duty to the patient first, not the family. One of the only examples of possible psychological harm to a patient would be an actively suicidal person who was given significant bad news.\nThe motives of the family members are irrelevant. Whether they are kind and loving or vindictive and evil makes no difference. This is true whether their request to withhold information is in writing or is from the hospital ethics committee. In this case, the ethics committee is not necessary because there is no substantive question of the right action to inform the patient first. The health-care proxy’s opinion and participation are only mandated if the patient loses decision-making capacity.

    "case": "6. Your patient has just recently been diagnosed with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This disorder is chronic, progressive, and fatal. There is a genetic test that can tell whether children of parents with the disease will develop it. The test is very accurate. The patient has become divorced and refuses to give you his consent to inform his ex-wife who now has custody of their three children. He threatens to sue you if you reveal elements of his medical care to his ex-wife.\nWhat should you do?\na. Respect the patient’s right to confidentiality.\nb. Transfer the patient’s care to another physician as long as the patient agrees.\nc. Ask the health department to inform the patient’s ex-wife about the disease risk.\nd. Seek a court order to inform the patient’s ex-wife.\ne. Inform the patient’s ex-wife of the risk to the children.\nAnswer: (e) Inform the patient’s ex-wife of the risk to the children.\nComment: The patient’s right to confidentiality ends where it comes into conflict with the safety of other people. The right to confidentiality is extremely strong, but it is not universal and absolute. In this case, the children of the patient have a right to know whether their lives will be cut short by the disease of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and colon cancer. The most important element is that screening for polyps should begin at the age of 12 with screening sigmoidoscopy every year. Colectomy needs to be done if polyps are found. Hence, in FAP there is a very specific intervention that can prevent colon cancer and a very specific screening that can be done. In addition, the mother has a right to know whether her children will become ill and how to plan for that.\nIf a child falls and breaks his leg, one parent cannot claim confidentiality as a reason to withhold this critical health information from the other parent. As a part of divorce, the stipulation that each parent must inform the other parent of health-care issues for the children as they arise is a standard part of the agreement.\nAlthough, in this case, the health-care issue involves the private health of one parent, the issue is still pertinent to the other parent as the caregiver of the children.\nThe right to one person’s to privacy is not as important as the right of another person to safety. This is established standard and does not require a court order. You will have more liability from the mother of the children if she is NOT informed than from violating the confidentiality of the patient to inform. She can successfully pursue a legal action stating you, the physician, did not inform her that her children were at risk of the “injury” of the genetic disease.\nThe health department does not do notification for genetic diseases. The health department notifies partners and the population at risk of transmissible diseases such as tuberculosis, HIV, STDs, and food- or water-borne diseases.",

You have the closest relationship with the family of anyone on the team. The ventilator is to be removed soon and organ donation is considered.\nWho should ask for consent for organ donation in this case?\na. You, because you are the person with the best relationship with the family\nb. The resident because you are only a student\nc. Attending of record\nd. Hospital administration\ne. Organ-donor network\nAnswer: (e) Organ-donor network\nComment: The rules concerning organ donation are quite specific that the medical team taking care of the patient must not be the ones asking for the donation of organs. This is a conflict of interest. It pits the family’s perception of the physician as caregiver against the impression that the medical staff just wants the organs. There can also be significant amounts of irrational thinking associated with grief such as the family thinking you only want to turn off the ventilator so you can harvest the organs. The medical team must stay clearly in the role of the people trying to preserve the life of the patient. The other most practical reason for the organ-donor network to ask is that their chance of successfully obtaining consent is far, far in excess of physicians who ask. The organ-donor network doing the asking both preserves the ethical integrity of the medical team in the eyes of the family as well as markedly increasing the supply of viable organs available for donation.",

A DNR order has nothing to do with any of the other forms of care that the patient is receiving. A DNR order has no impact on the use of dialysis. You should pretend that the DNR order does not exist when evaluating for dialysis. Hyperkalemia is life threatening. It is illogical to use an inferior therapy such as kayexalate for the long-term management of the hyperkalemia of renal failure if dialysis is indicated. This patient is awake, alert, and able to understand his or her own medical problems.

There is no national law guiding physician reporting of an impaired driver for reasons of age, cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer’s, or neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson disease. A few states require mandatory reporting to the Department of Motor Vehicles in order to restrict or remove a driver’s license. Most do not. Some states offer protection for physicians in case the report is not honored. Most do not. The rates of motor vehicle accidents remained stable in older patients until the age of 70 when there is a slight rise. However, the highest rate of motor vehicle accidents in all age groups is in those above 85. This group of the very old exceeds even teenagers in terms of the rate of motor vehicle accidents. Because the standards for reporting of the impaired driver varies based on the state, there can be no question where the correct answer is either to report or not to report because this is a national examination. All that can be universally agreed upon is that you should encourage a potentially impaired driver at any age to seek alternate forms of transportation or to have someone else drive.",

He lives alone and survives on a combination of public assistance and a low paying part-time job sweeping floors. You have thoroughly explained the procedure to him in terms of risks and benefits. He repeatedly refuses the procedure entirely on the basis of “I just don’t want it.”\nWhat should you do?\na. Perform the procedure.\nb. Seek consent from the family.\nc. Honor his decision and do not do the colonoscopy.\nd. Seek a court order mandating the procedure.\nAnswer: (c) Honor his decision and do not do the colonoscopy.\nComment: Just because a patient may be incompetent in certain areas of his life does not mean that he is not able to consent for medical procedures. The patient described has a severe and permanent cognitive impairment; however, he is still able to refuse the procedure. A patient can be considered incompetent for financial issues but still have the ability to make medical decisions. It would not be advisable to recommend routine medical procedures against the will of the patient. This would mean literally forcing him into the endoscopy through restraints or sedation. Incompetence in one area does not mean total incompetence. The court recognizes a much lower standard of cognitive ability to reliably consent or refuse procedures compared with financial decisions. It is easier to be declared incompetent for financial decisions than it is for medical decisions.",

    "case": "21. Mr. M. consents to a procedure on his left ear. After the patient is anesthetized Dr. W. discovers that the right ear is in greater need of surgery.\nWhat should the surgeon do?\na. Perform the procedure on the right ear if it is clear that it is more necessary.\nb. Wake the patient up and seek consent for a different procedure.\nc. Seek a second opinion from another surgeon and proceed with the more necessary procedure.\nd. Perform the procedure on both ears.\nAnswer: (b) Wake the patient up and seek consent for a different procedure.\nComment: You must obtain informed consent by specific procedure. Consent for another procedure or clear medical necessity cannot infer consent for another procedure. Neither the medical necessity of the procedure, the seriousness of the condition, nor the assumption that any reasonable person would consent is sufficient to assume that consent is given. The patient is not aware of his surroundings and condition because of the sedation. You cannot have an “informed consent” without waking up and informing the patient. Another example would be a blood transfusion in a Jehovah’s Witness. If, during a procedure, a clear but unexpected necessity for blood transfusion arises, you must wake the patient up and ask about the patient’s wishes to have or not have blood. The consent or refusal must be informed. You cannot say that because of the necessity or sedation, that you should just give the blood. On the other hand, just because a patient is a Jehovah’s Witness, you cannot assume that he will refuse the blood. A refusal must be informed as well. The patient could, after all, be a Jehovah’s Witness who does not agree with that religion’s teaching on blood. Each procedure must undergo an individual consent process.",

There is no proxy or family member available to give consent for the procedure and to substitute for his own judgment. In other words, what would the patient want for himself should he be able to make decisions for himself. The co-worker does not count as a person who can give consent.

Ask the guardian what is in the best interests of the patient.\nAnswer: (d) Ask the guardian what is in the best interests of the patient.\nComment: This patient has never been competent so there is no possibility of trying to determine what he had wanted for himself. There is no family to act in his best interests. You cannot substitute judgment for a person that has never had judgment. This case involves decision making on the least accurate of the decision-making standard, which is to determine what would be in the best interests of the patient. The reason this is the least accurate method of giving or withholding consent is that there is no way to be sure what the patient would have wanted for himself. With a best interests standard we have the difficult problem of determining whether the guardian is basing their decision on what the patient would need, or the guardian’s own subjective standard of what they would want for themselves. In this case, the burden of therapy for no chance of cure is worse than the option of simply deferring therapy. If there is a court-appointed guardian, then there is no point of an “expert panel.” The question here is not one of what the best medical therapy is, but what is in the best interests of a patient too mentally impaired to make his own decisions.",

Have him undergo psychological screening first.\nd. Refer him to a specialist in this area.\ne. In-patient psychiatric evaluation for suicidal ideation.\nAnswer: (a) Provide the pain medications as appropriate but not the means to end his life.\nComment: Physician-assisted suicide is always considered unacceptable. The patient is not acutely depressed so antidepressants are unnecessary. This form of reasoning does not need an inpatient psychiatric evaluation. Try never to refer patients on board questions for anything. There is no “specialist” that can certify a patient as a good candidate for assisted suicide. There is an ethical imperative for the physician to preserve life. Consequently there are no acceptable circumstances in which a patient can act as an assistant in suicide. There is significant concern that putting the power to end life in the hands of the physician is an uncontrollable power that would easily be subject to abuse and indiscriminant use. In addition, there may be many depressed persons in need of treatment for depression who would otherwise simply choose suicide on demand. Remember that the boards are not testing your personal opinions about what you think ought to be acceptable. They are testing the best consensus of the law and practice guidelines.\nYou may personally agree with physician-assisted suicide or disagree that first trimester abortions are acceptable. Just do not choose these as the answers to the test questions. Forty-nine or 50 states have laws that make physician-assisted suicide illegal. The experiment in the state of Oregon where physician-assisted suicide is legal does not hold true for any other place in the United States. Hence, on a national examination, you must go with what would be true in the majority of cases.

You tell him that under no circumstances can you participate in euthanasia.\nAnswer: (e) You tell him that under no circumstances can you participate in euthanasia.\nComment: Under no circumstances is it ethical for a physician to participate in euthanasia.\nThe difference between euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide is that euthanasia is a means of death administered to the patient by another. Physicians are not ethically permitted to destroy life. This is true even if there is a law authorizing it. The higher ethical duty of the physician to preserve life supersedes state law. Euthanasia is unacceptable even if a competent patient requests it. Physician-assisted suicide is different from euthanasia in that the physician provides the patient with the means to end their own lives. In physician-assisted suicide, the patient administers the means of ending their life. In euthanasia, the physician administers the means of death. Both of these are unacceptable. This is markedly different from giving pain medications or other therapy that inadvertently ends the patient’s life. If the only way to control a person’s pain and suffering completely is to give medications that inadvertently or unintentionally shorten the patient’s life, this is acceptable. This is sometimes referred to as terminal sedation. The primary issue is one of intent. In euthanasia, the primary intent is to end life. In terminal sedation, the primary intent is to relieve suffering.",

Telling your dean of students is inappropriate because the dean of students does not supervise the resident.

For attending physicians it can be the department chair or the medical director of the hospital. For attending physicians not reporting or working for local authorities, make the report at the higher level of the state licensing board or the mechanisms in place for impaired physicians.

You are the full-time employee of an outpatient facility run by a managed-care plan and you have recently received written instructions not to bring up subjects such as bone marrow transplantation in myeloma with patients. The reasoning was that they are outrageously expensive and do not cure the disease, although it may extend survival. The data that they extend survival are not entirely conclusive. In addition, in a private meeting with the medical director, you have been told that the expenditures per patient load of care of each of the physicians would be examined yearly to determine which physician would be promoted.\nWhat do you do?\na. Fully inform the patient about the risks and benefits of bone marrow transplantation.\nb. Refer your patient to an oncologist to have this discussion.\nc. Transfer the patient to another primary-care provider.\nd. Advise the patient to fde suit against the managed care plan.\ne. Inform the patient about bone marrow transplantation if he asks you about it.\nAnswer: (a) Fully inform the patient about the risks and benefits of bone marrow transplantation.\nComment: Your primary duty is always to the patient. One of the unique elements of the physician/ patient relationship is that its ethical boundaries transcend ordinary rules of the workplace and institutional rules. As such, you cannot withhold information from a patient if that information may lead to benefit for the patient. In order to make an “informed consent,” the patient must be fully informed. The patient cannot be fully informed if he has not heard of the options. It is not appropriate for you to back away from educating your patient by transferring care unless it is for an area outside your expertise. There is no need to encourage litigation under any circumstances.\nIt is not ethical to tell a patient about a potential therapy only if he asks about it. It is our duty to inform him. “Gag orders” preventing the education of patients about treatment options are always wrong. The patients cannot have autonomy over the choice of treatment of their body if they are not aware of the options. Beneficence to the patient always outweighs institutional directives.",

He has three vessels with more than 90 percent occlusion and left ventricular dysfunction. He is referred for bypass surgery. The cardiothoracic surgeon at your hospital refuses to operate on your patient because he is scared of touching HIV-positive patients for fear of seroconversion. He is already on a beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, and aspirin.\nWhat should you do?\na. Add calcium channel blockers.\nb. Perform angioplasty and stenting.\nc. Add clopidogrel.\nd. Have his chief of service compel him to do the procedure.\ne. Refer the patient to another cardiothoracic surgeon.\nAnswer: (e) Refer the patient to another cardiothoracic surgeon.\nComment: The patient has a very clear need for coronary bypass surgery with three-vessel disease and left ventricular function. The bottom-line point to this question is about what you do for patients who need a particular procedure when the physician is refusing to do the right thing. Answers b, c, and d involve switching the patient to another form of therapy, which is inadequate, compared with surgery. This is unacceptable. You cannot force the surgeon to operate against his will. Although it is unethical for a physician to refuse care on the basis of race, gender, ethnic origin, and diseases such as HIV, you cannot legally force a physician to take care of someone they do not want to. The physician/patient relationship that must be entered into voluntarily on both parts; hence, it is unethical to refuse to treat a patient solely based on your dislike or discomfort with HIV-positive persons, but it is not illegal. The chief of service may have the power to remove or suspend hospital privileges and to fire someone for unethical behavior, but the chief of service does not have the ability to force a physician to perform a procedure. When a patient needs a procedure that your consultant will not do, then the right action is to find the patient a doctor who will do the right thing. Although this case was framed in terms of HIV, the answer of referring to another physician would be the same no matter what reason the physician had for refusing to do the procedure.",

A minor is generally defined as a person below the age of 18. The necessity of parental consent or at least notification is a mixed issue across states nationally. Some states require parental notification and some states do not. Hence, as a board examination, which is given nationally, there is no single clear answer. Unlike the bar examination for lawyers, physicians take virtually no state-specific examination. When you pass USMLE or the Board of Internal Medicine, it is valid in every state.\nThe only thing that is always clear is that we should strongly encourage the patient herself to have the discussion with her parents. Many of the boards will want an answer indicating discussion before action so you will be trained into trying to build consensus. Even if you are within your rights to walk up to a brain-dead patient and remove the ventilator without consent of the family, the boards will always want you to answer “discuss with the family” first if that is one of the options.",

Legally you can only do it if her life is at risk.\ne. No, you can’t do it because the fetus is normal.\nAnswer: (d) Legally you can only do it if her life is at risk.\nComment: Abortion during the third trimester is the most controversial area of reproductive rights. There is no automatic right to abortion on demand past the first trimester.\nDuring the third trimester, the fetus is potentially viable. A fetus at 28 weeks of gestational age (six months) can potentially survive intact with a delivery although it would have a greater risk of complications secondary to prematurity. The Supreme Court has consistently left exceptions for the possibility of abortion in later stages of pregnancy if the life of the mother is at risk. You cannot ethically freely abort a potentially viable fetus unless there is a very significant extenuating circumstance such as risk to the mother or a fetus so developmentally abnormal that fetal demise is certain. As for a court order, the court cannot order a physician to perform a task that is ethically or professionally unacceptable. For example, if a law passed tomorrow making it legal to perform euthanasia on a person with Down syndrome, it would still be unethical to do so even with a court order. This is similar to the ethical unacceptability of a physician participating in an execution. The condemned is under a court order to die and it is legal.

You will report it if you find evidence that the wife was really the attacker.\nAnswer: (b) You will report the injury only with his consent.\nComment: The rules on the reporting of domestic violence are much less strict than those on reporting child abuse are. This is because a competent adult has the voluntary choice of reporting the injury themselves in the vast majority of cases. In addition, you cannot violate the patient’s right to autonomy by specifically doing something that has expressively been refused. For children there is mandatory reporting because children do not have the ability to defend themselves.
