After some months of discussion and the seeking of legal and ethical opinion, it had been agreed that her request to disconnect the respirator could be agreed to. A device was fixed up that enabled her to switch off the machine, and three days after our conversation, at a pre-arranged time and with all her family present, she flipped the switch. Drugs were administered to alleviate any respiratory distress and she lapsed into unconsciousness. However, a short time later she woke up and asked angrily, \"Why am I still here?\" More medication was given and she relapsed once more into an unconscious state. It was some hours later before eventually her breathing ceased entirely and she died. (Campbell, 1998, pp. 83-4)",

    "case": "The case of Mr R\nMr R was born with a serious malformation of the brain and cerebral palsy. At eight months of age he developed severe epilepsy. At the age of 23 he had spastic diplegia (paralysis) and was incontinent, as well as apparently deaf and blind (with possible vestigial response to a buzzer and to light). He was unable to walk, to sit upright or to chew; so that food had to be syringed to the back of his mouth. His bowels had to be evacuated manually because his limited diet resulted in serious constipation. He suffered from thrush and had ulcers all the way through his guts, according to testimony. When cuddled he did indicate pleasure, and he also appeared to respond to pain by grimacing. Although he was not comatose, nor in a persistent vegetative state, his awareness on a scale of 1 to 10 was rated somewhere between 1 and 2 in an assessment by Dr Keith Andrews of the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability at Putney, London, who said:\n\nIt is my opinion that he has very little, if any, real cognitive awareness at a level where he can interpret what is going on in his environment. He reacts at the most basic level by responding to comfort, warmth and a safe environment by being relaxed and producing the occasional smile. He responds to discomfort, pain and threatening situations by becoming distressed and crying. These are very basic level responses and do not imply any thought processes.\n\nUntil he was 17 Mr R lived at home, where he was totally dependent on his devoted parents. He then moved to a residential home, but continued to return home at weekends. Now his condition was beginning to deteriorate: his weight had dropped to just over 30 kg, and he was extremely frail, suffering from recurrent chest infections, bleeding from ulceration of the oesophagus, and continued epileptic fits. In 1995 he was admitted to hospital on five occasions, each time for a life-threatening crisis. After the last crisis Dr S, the consultant psychiatrist for learning difficulties who was responsible for his care, wrote:\n\nTo hospitalize Mr R if he had another life-threatening crisis would, in my clinical judgement, be nothing more than striving officiously to keep him alive for no gain to him.\n\nIn my opinion, this is tantamount to a failing against a basic duty of humanity. Indeed, at the last few admissions to hospital, I have had real concern as to whether it was ethical to resuscitate Mr R; in other words, that we should withhold treatment from him. A similar issue arose in the case of Anna but for her the issue then became whether or not treatment should be withdrawn. Is there any difference between the two? The General Medical Council (GMC) has noted that:\n\nAlthough it may be emotionally more difficult for the health care team, and those close to the patient, to withdraw a treatment from a patient rather than to decide not to provide a treatment in the first place, this should not be used as a reason for failing to initiate a treatment which may be of some benefit to the patient. Where it has been decided that a treatment is not in the best interests of the patient, there is no ethical or legal obligation to provide it and therefore no need to make a distinction between not starting the treatment and withdrawing it.\n\nIt strikes us that there are at least 10 ethically charged terms and concepts contained within Dr S's opinion: (1) Best interests of the patient (2) Gain or benefit to the patient (3) Sanctity of life (4) Duty of humanity (5) Death with dignity (6) Relief of suffering (7) Wishes of the parents (8) Withholding treatment (9) Treating actively (10) Medical futility.\n\nIn the High Court hearing, where Mr R was represented by the Official Solicitor (who acts on behalf of incompetent patients), discussion centred on guidelines for resuscitation issued by the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1993 in a joint statement with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). The immediate question now was whether to resuscitate Mr R in the event of another acute admission resulting in cardiac arrest. He was so frail that it was feared CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) might crush his ribcage. In addition, there was a risk of further brain damage from resuscitation. A subsidiary question was whether to administer antibiotics if he developed pneumonia. After Mr R's fifth hospital admission, in September 1995, the consultant, Dr S, discussed the position with Mr R's parents. They agreed that Mr R would not be subjected to CPR if he suffered a cardiac arrest in future. Accordingly, Dr S signed a DNR (do not resuscitate) direction, signed by Mr R's mother under the heading next of kin. This decision was opposed by staff at the day care centre which Mr R had been attending; they felt that he did in fact have some quality of life. In addition they interpreted Dr S's decision as a no treatment policy, which Dr S denied: the only treatment which she was withholding, she argued, was cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Agreement could not be reached, and a member of the day care centre staff applied for review of the decision by a court, on the basis of information provided by social workers involved in Mr R's day care.\n\nThe basis of the application was that the DNR decision was irrational and unlawful in permitting medical treatment to be withheld on the basis of an assessment of the patient's quality of life. The hospital sought a court judgement that, despite Mr R's incompetence to give a valid refusal of treatment, it would be lawful and in his best interests to withhold cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and the administration of antibiotics. However, a proposed gastrostomy would be performed, underlining that there was no question of a comprehensive refusal to treat Mr R. Likewise, the hospital decided that it would ventilate Mr R and provide artificial nutrition and hydration if applicable, although initially it had indicated it would not. The application made it clear that the hospital intended to furnish such treatment and nursing care as may from time to time be appropriate to ensure that [R] suffers the least distress and retains the greatest dignity until such time as his life comes to an end.\n\nThe 1993 BMA/RCN guidelines, as used in relation to Mr R, did not actually say that resuscitation must always be attempted unless the patient is clearly in a terminal condition. Instead, they suggested three types of case in which it is appropriate to consider a DN(A)R decision:\n\n(a) Where the patient's condition indicates that effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unlikely to be successful\n\n(b) Where CPR is not in accord with the recorded sustained wishes of the patient who is mentally competent\n\n(c) Where successful CPR is likely to be followed by a length and quality of life which would not be acceptable to the patient.\n\nCondition (a) is the most obviously clinical of the three. It seems to focus solely on the medical facts of the matter. Certainly Mr R is gravely ill, but he has come through five acute admissions in the past year, so it is difficult to say that he is definitely unlikely to survive CPR. Condition (b) cannot be met, because Mr R is not mentally competent to record a wish. Finally, we have condition (c), focusing on unacceptable quality of life but again, the guidance talks of this being acceptable or unacceptable to the patient. It is very hard to know whether Mr R gets any enjoyment out of life: he seems to respond to being cuddled, and to react to pain, but that is really all we can say. The BMA guidelines did note that If the patient cannot express a view, the opinion of others close to the patient may be sought regarding the patient's best interests. But, although the situation is nowadays different in England, the 1993 guidelines do not say that opinion has anything more than advisory value as to what the patient would regard as reasonable quality of life. (We will consider the views of his family again in a moment.) The guidelines also appear to envision a different kind of situation where a previously competent patient, who (unlike Mr R) had expressed definite views about good and bad quality of life, is no longer able to enunciate his or her wishes, but where the family will remember his or her preferences.\n\nSo, strictly speaking, it is possible to make a case for arguing that none of these conditions applies to Mr R. But that was not the opinion of the court. Prompted by guidance from Keith Andrews as an expert witness, the court agreed that conditions (b) and (c) were not applicable ruling out the quality of life arguments both for and against. Only condition (a) was to be considered, that is, the likelihood rather than the desirability of successful CPR. Even in hospital settings only about 13% of patients receiving CPR survive to discharge, Dr Andrews testified; in a residential home such as the one Mr R lived in, the chances would be virtually nil. Accordingly, the case turned on the alleged futility of treatment, rather than on the quality of Mr R's life. On the basis of medical futility, the Court accepted the DNAR order, but not a global policy against other interventions by the consultant when and if a potentially life-threatening infection arose.",

    "case": "The case of Mr C\nMr C, aged 68, had paranoid schizophrenia and\nhad been detained in a secure mental hospital for\n30 years. His delusions included the belief that his\ndoctors were torturers, whilst he himself was a world-\nfamous specialist in the treatment of diseased limbs.\nWhen his own foot became infected, he therefore hid\nhis condition from medical personnel until it had\nactually become gangrenous. His doctors believed\nthat unless his foot was amputated, he stood an\n80% to 85% chance of dying.\nMr C, however, refused to consent to the ampu-\ntation, saying that he would rather die intact than\nsurvive with only one foot. He sought reassurances\nfrom the hospital that his foot would not be ampu-\ntated without his consent if he slipped into a coma.\nThe health authority in charge of the hospital refused\nto give an undertaking not to amputate his foot with-\nout his consent. Mr C then sought a High Court order\nto prevent amputation if he became unconscious.\nAs Mr C s solicitor, Lucy Scott-Montcrie , explained:\nThe issue at the heart of all of this was whether or\nnot Mr C had the capacity to refuse the treatment\nthat was being o ered to him. Mental illness\ndoesn t of itself mean that a person doesn t have\ncapacity; you could have capacity for some things\nand not other things. We had to establish whether\nMr C could understand and retain the information\nabout the advantages and disadvantages of ampu-\ntation and the advantages and disadvantages of\nnot having amputation. The surgeon who d been\ntreating Mr C gave evidence; what he said was that\nhe believed that Mr C did have capacity, because\nMr C s views about capacity tted in a very normal –\nsort of way with the views of other elderly people\nwith vascular disease who got gangrene more or\nless at the end of their lives. They didn t want to\nspend their last few years either coping with an\namputation or possibly coping with repeated\namputation as the vascular system fails all round\nthe body. So the order was made that the hospital\ntrust shouldn t amputate his foot without his per-\nmission. (BBC, 1995) In the event, Mr C survived, and his case made UK\nlegal history for two reasons, the rst being that\nthe ruling in his case established clear criteria for\ncompetence:\n(1) Capacity to comprehend and retain information\nabout the proposed treatment. Mr C was found to\nhave this capacity, in part because it was shown\nthat in other aspects of everyday prudence, such as\nbudgeting, he was able to take sensible decisions.\nFurther, it was held that what mattered was the\nnarrowly construed ability to comprehend and\nretain information about this particular decision,\non a functional basis, not capacity in some general\nsense. Given the general presumption of\ncompetence in adults, the doctors had to establish\nthat Mr C did not possess this capacity; the court\nheld that this had not been proved.\n(2) Belief in the validity of the information. It might be\nthought questionable whether Mr C really believed\nwhat the doctors told him; after all, he thought\nthey were torturers. Perhaps he also believed, in\nhis delusions about his own medical stardom,\nthat he knew better than the hospital physicians.\nNevertheless, the court held that Mr C also met\nthis criterion.\n(3) Ability to weigh up the information so as to arrive\nat a choice. Mr C had balanced the risks and\nbenefits differently from the doctors, but that did\nnot invalidate his decision, particularly because an\nexpert witness had testified that many other elderly\npeople came to the same conclusion.",

It seemed that\nhe would at some point need and he wanted to\nreceive arti cial nutrition and hydration. Guidance had\nbeen formulated by the General Medical Council\n(GMC) in the UK about when life-supporting treatment\nmight, and might not, be o ered to patients like Mr\nBurke, and he feared that the guidance indicated that\nhe would not be eligible to receive arti cial food and\nfluids.

    "case": "Section 4: Withdrawing treatment from incompetent patients - The Terri Schiavo case\n\nLeslie Burke resisted the idea that he might be denied treatment at a time when he would not be able to communicate his views. Despite the court's reassurance in his case, it is clear that decisions are sometimes made to limit the treatment that could be provided to patients who are incompetent due to age or a\u0000iction. Modern medicine's potential for prolonging life can give rise to intense dilemmas about whether it is right to use the new treatments and techniques that have become available. So what should be the goal of medicine in these sorts of cases, and which version of the value of life should guide our thinking? Furthermore, who should get to make the final decision? We might think that the patient's opinions should carry most weight, but in the cases we are now considering the patient is not (or no longer) competent and they might well not have issued an advance directive. Do we then ask their family members or other loved ones to decide, as was contemplated in Mr R's case? If so, do we only heed the views of someone who has been granted an enduring power of attorney (in other words, made a healthcare proxy, and thereby empowered to decide on the patient's behalf)? What if no such document has been executed? And, in any case, what happens if the family members cannot agree?\n\nThese are difficult questions, which have required the attention of judges across the globe. In some of these legal cases, the doctors and the patient's family were in complete agreement about what should happen, as occurred in the famous British case of Anthony Bland. On that occasion, the court decided that it would be lawful for artificially provided nutrition and hydration to be withdrawn from Mr Bland, who was in a persistent vegetative state (Airedale NHS Trust v Bland [1993] 2 WLR 816). The judges felt that continued treatment was no longer in Mr Bland's best interests; some of them thought that Mr Bland no longer had any interests, given that he appeared no longer to have the ability to feel or experience life in any meaningful sense. This is a controversial idea, not least because recent neuroscientific evidence casts doubt on the idea that patients in a PVS are completely unconscious and insensate (Panksepp et al., 2007). However, as one might expect, the ethical dilemmas become even more acute when the various individuals involved in the care of a seriously unwell patient cannot agree on what should happen. These sorts of dilemmas have unfortunately played out not only in the courts but also in the media (e.g. English et al., 2009). A particularly divisive American case that attracted international attention involved Terri Schiavo, as we describe below.\n\nThe Terri Schiavo case\n\nTerri Schiavo was only 26 when she collapsed at home and experienced severe oxygen deprivation (anoxia) for several minutes. She was hospitalized and underwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube (PEG) because she could not swallow. Four months later, with no amelioration of her condition, she was judged to be in a persistent vegetative state.\n\nUnder the laws of Florida, where the Schiavos lived, Terri's husband Michael was appointed her legal guardian, since she was judged incompetent to decide on her own care and had not executed an advance directive. Alongside Terri's parents, Robert and Mary Schindler, Michael worked with the clinicians to try to overcome Terri's condition by means of all available therapies, but after several years there was still no improvement.\n\nAt this point Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers began to disagree over what should be done. Michael believed that Terri's condition was irreversible and that she would not have wanted to be kept alive in a persistent vegetative state. Her parents, in contrast, wanted to maintain her artificial hydration and nutrition. The matter was taken to the courts when Michael Schindler petitioned for an independent determination of Mrs Schiavo's terminal condition, including the decision to continue or discontinue life-prolonging procedures (cited in Perry et al., 2005, p. 745).\n\nBut how firm was the diagnosis of persistent vegetative state? Since the case of Tony Bland, a series of much-publicized examples had appeared to indicate that some minimal degree of function might still be retained by certain patients diagnosed as being in PVS (Andrews et al., 1996; Bauby, 1997). In reply to a subsequent critic who claimed that Terri Schiavo was actually in a locked-in state rather than true PVS, however, the bioethicist Art Caplan thundered: \"I would like to have him find three neurologists who agree with that claim. Terri Schiavo suffered anoxia to her brain twice! Her brain damage was confirmed while she was alive by CAT scan and then at autopsy. She was blind despite the alleged tapes that were made showing her tracking objects. Her cortex had shriveled to half its normal mass.\" (Caplan, 2009)\n\nIn January 2000 a trial was held to settle the issue of Mrs Schiavo's future, with both sides presenting witnesses. The question, presiding Judge Greer said, was whether she would choose to have her artificial feeding and hydration continued if she were competent. Clear evidence of Mrs Schiavo's previously expressed wishes was admissible under Florida law, even if only made orally. It was held that the diagnosis of PVS in Mrs Schiavo was indeed valid: the court found that she met the statutory definition of the persistent vegetative state (Perry et al., 2005, p. 746).\n\nGiven that finding, the next issue was how Mrs Schiavo's autonomy rights could be exercised and what her true wishes would have been if she were competent. The trial judge ruled in favour of Mr Schiavo, who had produced three witnesses to affirm that his wife had previously declared she would not want to live like that. The feeding tube was ordered to be removed.\n\nRefusing to accept this outcome, the Schindlers took the case to appeal. By this point their daughter had been diagnosed as being in PVS for 10 years. The appellate court upheld the ruling of the lower court on both clinical and legal grounds, likewise ordering that the feeding tube should be removed.\n\nBefore the order could be put into effect, however, the Schindlers presented evidence before a second trial judge from other expert witnesses (none of whom had actually examined Terri) and succeeded in obtaining a further evidentiary hearing. They also claimed that new and better medical treatments for brain damage had become available since the initial trial. The case was referred back to Judge Greer, but he again ruled that Mr Schiavo's experts were more likely to be correct and that the supposed new remedies were not accepted by the mainstream neurological community as having a firm evidence base. On a second appeal in 2002, Judge Greer's decision was scrutinized and upheld as a cautious legal standard designed to promote the value of life (Perry et al., 2005, p. 746). This was the sequel:\n\n\"With Terri Schiavo's personalized decision determined at the 2000 trial and her medical condition confirmed at the 2002 hearing, artificial hydration and nutrition were stopped for the second time, on 15 October 2003, pursuant to court order. This order was superseded 6 days later when the Florida legislature passed and Governor Jeb Bush signed Terri's Law, which provided the governor unfettered discretion to order resumption of Mrs. Schiavo's medical treatment.\n\nEleven months later, the Florida Supreme Court held Terri's Law unconstitutional as a violation of separation of powers, and a third date was set for removal of the PEG tube. On 18 March 2005, the tube was removed for the final time, and despite the intervention of Congress and President George W. Bush, Terri Schiavo's saga ended with her death on 31 March 2005.\" (Perry et al., 2005, p. 748)\n",

    "case": "The case of Diane Pretty\nDiane Pretty had motor neurone disease, a condition that progressively attacks the sufferer s muscles, leaving them increasingly dependent on others to perform even the most basic tasks. Although she had, in her own words, fought this disease each step of the way , Mrs Pretty felt that her prognosis was bleak and she was especially concerned at the possibility that she might suffocate in the final stages of her life (Dyer, 2002). Rather than succumb to increasing dependency and a possibly distressing demise, Diane Pretty wished to obtain assistance in committing suicide, which her husband Brian was willing to provide. However, the law in England clearly condemns any such assistance: whilst suicide itself is lawful, assisting suicide is a crime that (according to the Suicide Act 1961) carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Rather than risk her husband being convicted and incarcerated, Mrs Pretty wanted confirmation from a legal official that no action would be taken against him. The official in question, the Director of Public Prosecutions, declined to make any such statement and so Mrs Pretty approached the courts in an attempt to demonstrate that the legal prohibition on assisted suicide violated her human rights.\n\nMrs Pretty insisted that her rights were being infringed in five ways. First, she claimed that her right to life granted her the right to determine when her life could come to an end that is, the right to life was a right that she could waive. Secondly, she argued that the state prohibition on assisted suicide meant that she was being forced to endure an inhuman and degrading existence. Thirdly, the right to personal autonomy or privacy entailed that her autonomous decision to die be respected. Fourthly, Mrs Pretty argued that she had a right to freedom of thought and that, as such, her right to believe in the justifiability of assisted suicide should translate into her (and her husband) being free to act in accordance with this belief. Finally, Mrs Pretty pointed to the right to be free from unjust discrimination; since able-bodied persons were freely entitled to commit suicide, Mrs Pretty argued that she as a disabled person – was being treated unfairly by the law.\n\nMrs Pretty s case reached the (then) highest court in England, the House of Lords. The five Law Lords decided, unanimously, that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe Mrs Pretty s rights (or indeed anyone else s).\n\nThe right to life, they explained, did not encompass a right to die; indeed, this would be contrary to the very purpose of the right, which was to uphold the sanctity of human life. Moreover, the Law Lords were not convinced that it was the legal policy (and therefore the UK government) which was the cause of Mrs Pretty s suffering; her disease, and the only obligation owed by the state was a duty to ensure that her suffering was adequately alleviated (which fell short of enabling her to have her life ended).\n\nThe judges were even less persuaded by Mrs Pretty s arguments about freedom of thought. Just because Mrs Pretty believed that assisted suicide was morally justified did not mean that the state had to recognize her right to engage in this. The Law Lords further rejected the idea that Mrs Pretty was being unjustly dealt with by the law, not least since they found no (legal) support for the idea that the decriminalization of suicide amounted to a legal right to commit suicide.\n\nThe House of Lords also resisted Mrs Pretty s seemingly central claim that her decision ought to be respected since it was autonomously reached. Respect for autonomy, they reasoned, only entitled an individual to be free in the way they lived their life and the right did not extend to seeking its ending. The judges added that, even if they were wrong about this, there were important social interests at stake (like the preservation of the sanctity of life) that justified placing limits on what an autonomous individual could do.\n\nMrs Pretty was neither impressed with the Law Lords decision nor deterred from advancing her cause. Using the same human rights arguments, she approached the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Once again, and for the final time, Mrs Pretty s case failed. However, the European court differed from the English court in one respect: it was willing to concede that Mrs Pretty did have a right to respect for her autonomous decisions, even a decision to die. It nevertheless concluded that it was for the UK government to decide whether there were more important social interests at stake that prevented the right from prevailing.\n\nMrs Pretty succumbed to her disease less than two weeks after she had lost her case in Strasbourg. Unfortunately, she appears to have endured the very breathing difficulties that she had fought to avoid (Dyer, 2002).",

The American bioethicist Daniel Callahan gives a\n’\nand the corresponding experience of life s meaning\n‘\nstriking summary of this protest: Your right to die\n’ ’\ndoesn t imply my duty to kill .\nthe chronic back pain which I experienced in the\nlower parts of my back was increasing. As this was\nSection 7: The values and goals\nff –\ndi erent from normal I had been used to chronic\n–\nof medicine revisited\nback pain for a great part of my life late in October I\nturned to my general practitioner. She diagnosed the\n‘ ’ ‘ fi ’\nback pain as functional and non-speci c and pre-\nscribed pain-killers. Her advice was not to work too\nhard\nand, indeed, in other areas of healthcare. Very often\nfi As the pain kept increasing, after a few weeks I\nreturned to the general practitioner. Now she pre-\nscribed di erent pain killers which had as little e ect\nas the previous ones. As my condition worsened, I had\na third consultation during which I expressed my wish\nto have X-rays of my back. Only very reluctantly and\nafter much pressure did my GP agree to refer me to a\nradiologist in the academic hospital. X-rays of my\nlower back showed no real and serious anomalies,\nalthough there was some minor pathology at the\nvertebrae. It appeared that my GP was content to\nsee these particularities as the possible (probable)\ncauses of my pain. Nevertheless, my situation kept\nworsening as there was no therapy available to better\nmy condition.\nAfter consultations with di erent other medical\nprofessionals, nally it was July 2004, so more than\nff –\nhalf a year after the rst consultation with the GP an\nassistant neurosurgeon decided to scan the whole of\nmy back with MRI. On the basis of this scan it\nappeared that there was a process to be seen halfway\ndown my spinal cord. After taking a biopsy it was\nff\nconcluded that I su ered from malignant B-cell non-\nHodgkin lymphoma and that it was localized in the\nabdomen and the bone marrow. This last detail\nexplained the seriousness of the pain I su ered.\nThe shock of a fatal diagnosis It is often said that a\n’\ncancer diagnosis is experienced as a death sentence\n’ by the people involved. The patient s life is at stake,\nalthough therapeutic prospects in many cancers\nff –\nand have improved particularly in the case of non-\n–\nHodgkin lymphoma for most people the prospect\nfi\nof premature death will be the rst thought when a\ncancer diagnosis is communicated. The knowledge of\n–\na cancer diagnosis implies that the patient and his\nfamily and friends need to relate to this new and\nmostly unexpected fact. One cannot escape the\nneed to give a place to the illness and the future\nprospects regarding treatment (if applicable) and pre-\nmature death.\nBecoming aware of the real signi cance and poten-\ntial impact of the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\ncertainly was not something which happened immedi-\nately after it became clear that there was something\nseriously wrong in my body. Additional diagnostic\nprocedures were in some way a distraction from what\nreally was the case, as if as such these procedures\n‘ ’\nalready improved my future prospects. So the shock\nof a fatal diagnosis was not really a shock, but some-\nthing which evolved in the diagnostic process and\nduring treatment. In my opinion this phenomenon\na ects bioethical and legal notions of informed consent\nfi\nand refusal of treatment, as these notions are tightly\nconnected to communicative aspects during the\nillness course, as well as psychological, social and cul-\ntural factors which relate to defence mechanisms,\ndistortion of information, and cultural habits and at-\nfi\nvalues.\nHope Some claim that hope is the crucial factor in\nff\nthe care for patients with cancer. Hope involves the\nprospect that in the future there will be a cure, or at\nleast a prospect of a life with an acceptable quality for\nff\nthe patient. During the di erent treatments I have\n–\nundergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and\nautologous stem-cell transplantation I have experi-\nenced a lot of support from the idea that at the end of\nthe tunnel there would be the light of a successful\ntreatment, even though I was aware that this chance\nfi\nwas real, but de nitely not a guarantee. Above that I\ngranted myself the outlook that I would have the luck\nto belong to the statistical group of patients who\nsu ered). This promoted ghting spirit and gave strength\nff\nduring di cult times.\nIsolation In a case of severe illness (together with\nburdensome medical treatments like chemotherapy\nand radiation) the patient becomes more and more\nfi\ninvolved with and focused on the illness and the\ntreatments. In my case, the experience of intense\nand enduring pain isolates the person from his\nsurroundings. The physical environment has little\nor no meaning and personal contact becomes di -\ncult, as the person is almost exclusively involved\nwith and focused on the pain he experiences. This\nintroversion increases the vulnerability of the patient who has di culty in expressing his or her\nneeds and wishes; this implies a need for carers to\nbe sensitive to the unexpressed needs the patient\nmay have. An illustration in my experience was the\npressure sores on my back, which went undetected\nfor some time.\nContemplating wishes in advance As it became clear\nthat my illness might progress in such a way that my\nlife would end during or after treatment, I decided\nthat it would be helpful to draft an advance directive\nstating my medical wishes in case I became uncon-\nscious or otherwise incompetent. When drafting the\nadvance directive together with my wife, we discov-\nered that it was not easy to formulate in an exact and\nunambiguous way my wishes regarding end-of-life\ntreatment and care. It was particularly hard to delin-\neate care which would be acceptable, and care which\nwould not be acceptable. In drafting an advance\ndirective, one rst needs to be conscious of the values\nwhich lie at the basis of your concerns about care at\nthe end of life. On the basis of these values it becomes\npossible to give practical guidance to carers and rel-\natives. In any case, I learned that debating my wishes\nwith my wife gave me the con dence that in case I\nbecame incompetent and decisions ought to be\nmade, then my wife would be in a good position to\nact as my representative on the basis of my personal\nvalues and wishes. It seems to me that the involve-\nment of a person who is close to the patient can\nprovide much better and more valuable input into\nff\nthe process of medical (and ethical) decision-making\nat the end of life than any formal advance document.\nAt the same time I am aware that this is the ideal case\nin which there is a formal advance directive together\nwith a person who has knowledge of the concerns\nand wishes of the patient.\nHopelessness My experience with severe pain is\nlargely connected to the pre-diagnosis period\n(October 2003 July 2004). Central in this period was\n‘ ’\nthe continuous back pain which coloured my exis-\ntence and that of my family and friends.\nAs the pain became unbearable, the rehabilita-\ntion physician who was in charge of my physical\ncondition would give an injection with corticoste-\nff fi\nroids. The e ects were really miraculous. The rst\ntime, within two hours the pain was completely\ngone and kept away for six weeks. This gave me\nand my family the opportunity to spend ten happy\nffi days in Tuscany. However, each subsequent injection\nhad less e ect, and after 4 or 5 injections the pain\nonly stayed away for less than 24 hours. The rehabil-\nitation physician discussed the issue and explained\nthat he thought it was useless to continue the use of\ncorticosteroids. I could not do other than agree, there\nwas no choice.\nLess than a week later as my condition kept\ngrowing worse the situation became unbearable.\nThe pain was continuously intense and I saw no pros-\npect of relief whatsoever. As there was no use in\nadministering corticosteroids, I contemplated suicide\nas an escape from this terrible lot. After a sleepless\nnight I remember it was early on a Saturday morn-\ning I called the rehabilitation physician. In my mind, I\nhad made the decision that if he was not willing to\ninject me once more with corticosteroids, I would\njump from the local bridge into the river.\nConfusion and broken communication Next to the\npain during the pre-diagnosis period, there was the\npain which accompanied the medical procedures\nparticularly the intensive chemotherapy which was\nfollowed by autologous stem-cell transplantation I\nreceived morphine by injection. This pain-killer was\nfl\ncontinuously infused by a syringe driver, and brie y\nafter the start of this I became seriously confused. This\nff\nconfusion encompassed di erent experiences.\nThe rst experience was one of hallucinations:\nff\npartly visual, and partly what I would call experiential.\nThe visual experience involved distortions of visual\nperception: when I looked out of the hospital window,\n’ ff\nI saw dancing construction cranes.\nThe second experience involved what may be\ncalled broken communication . This was very fright-\nening. As I had di culty expressing myself, I was\nunable to clarify my wishes, but particularly my con-\ncerns to others. An example was my conviction that\n’ ff\ntime had been xed.\nThe third experience involved unclearness about\nplace and time. Particularly at night I was disturbed\n’ ff\nabout my environment. I didn t exactly know where I\nwas, and why I was where I was staying. Besides that, I\ndidn t know the time or date, let s say the coordinates\nof my existence in time. As already mentioned, there\nwas a period in which I experienced time as being\nfixed, which was particularly troublesome as I thought\nfi\nthat this eternal xation of time would imply that I\nwould have to stay in the hospital without end. This\nwas extremely frightening as I was eager to leave\nhospital as quickly as possible.\nIn particular, the experience of broken communi-\ncation was frightening because I could not get my\nworries and fears across to the people who were\ncaring for me: nurses and doctors. Only my wife was\nsensitive enough and able to see that my mental\ncondition was worrisome. Her intervention led to a\nreduction of the morphine dose, which resulted in a\npassing of the side e ects.\nUnbearable su ering The notion of unbearable suf-\nfering is di cult to assess. In a recent publication, case\n’\nmotivations of patients with a request for euthanasia was explored on the basis of 10 patient-centred,\nqualitative studies (Dees et al., 2009). This exploration showed that patients express their unbearable\nand unrelieved su ering in terms of pain, weakness,\nfunctional impairment, dependency, being a burden, hopelessness, indignity, intellectual deterioration, perception of loss of one-self, loss of autonomy, and\nbeing tired of life.\nThe authors of this article conclude that the point\nwhere su ering becomes unbearable is a very indi-\nvidual perception that is closely related to the person-\nality, the life history, social factors, and existential\nmotivations. Irreversible disintegration and humilia-\ntion of the person appeared to be the start of openly\nexploring the phenomenology of death. The circum-\nstances of their illness brought all the patients to the\npoint where they would rather die than continue to\nlive under the conditions imposed by their illness.\nThe unbearableness of su ering can be explored\nfrom two positions: the viewpoint and experience of\n33",

We have used the Overall article to introduce you to this question, under the broader rubric of whether NRTs in general produce benefits or liabilities for children. One particularly prolonged debate has centred on the question of whether IVF should only be provided to partners in traditional relationships, usually a married couple. When the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 was first passed in the UK, a last-minute Parliamentary challenge resulted in the insertion of a requirement (in section 13.5) that IVF clinics had to take into account the welfare of the child born as a result of treatment, including the need of that child for a father. Arguably, this provision now violates the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 12) by denying everyone an equal right to found a family (Lee and Morgan, 2001, p. 159). Amid complaints from clinics that assessing that need was impractical, from lesbian couples that the requirement discriminated against them, and from people on all sides of the political spectrum that this provision interfered with personal reproductive choice, the requirement was finally scrapped in 2007. But it continues to be the case in other countries, such as France, that only heterosexual couples can receive IVF treatment, and that unmarried heterosexual couples must prove their seriousness about the projet parental by demonstrating that they have lived together for a certain number of years.\n\nACTIVITY: Please read the following commentary on the Natalie Evans case by Anna Smajdor (Smajdor, 2007), then researcher in medical ethics at Imperial College London and now lecturer in medical ethics at the University of East Anglia. As you read, ask yourself two questions: (1) What does reproductive autonomy mean in the Natalie Evans case? How did each partner conceive of their own autonomous consent to parenthood? (2) What would the demands of justice to both parties have entailed in this situation? Is there a right not to be a parent? Please open Scenario 5 on your CD-ROM, Freezing reproductive tissue, and follow the instructions given. You will see that you are periodically asked to select a response to a question about the video clip, to justify your response in a short written response and to compare your response with that of ethical and legal experts, clinicians and other practitioners. At the end of the scenario, you can also compare your responses with a chart of the key ethical, legal and professional issues illustrated by this case. Please complete the entire scenario (which takes about half an hour) before reading any further.\n\nOn 10 April 2007, Natalie Evans lost the final stage of a four-year legal battle for the right to implant embryos created with her eggs and the sperm of her former partner. Ms Evans had been diagnosed with cancer, and treatment necessitated the removal of her ovaries, leaving her sterile. Creating and storing embryos would, it was hoped, keep the possibility of motherhood open to her.\n\nHowever, Ms Evans hopes were shattered when her relationship broke down and her partner, Howard Johnston, withdrew his consent for the embryos to be used. Since the consent of both parties is required for fertility treatment or even for ongoing storage of embryos, it seemed that Ms Evans would have to forego her dream of parenthood. But she was unwilling to submit to the loss of her embryos without a fight; hence the protracted legal struggle which culminated in the European Court of Human Rights rejection of Ms Evans case.",

But Diane Blood eventually succeeded in exporting the sperm to Belgium and obtained treatment there, not once but twice resulting in the birth of two healthy and apparently much-loved sons. The Blood case was one of the rst, and most highly publicized, examples of what has come to be called reproductive tourism . This rather pejorative term, which makes light of the serious motives and dilemmas behind the issue, covers an increasing wide range of examples. For example, burgeoning private fertility clinics in Spain now number among their customers couples from Germany, France and the UK. The UK couples are frequently driven by the desire to avoid the now-mandatory right of children born as a result of a sperm or egg donor s contribution to know the identity of their genetic parent, while the Germans may be seeking to evade very strict restrictions on IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in their own law.",

    "case": "What did you decide Karin and Peter should do?\nWe ourselves feel that they should be entitled to travel abroad to obtain preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), even if German law forbids it. Oddly, although the German law is aimed at protecting the embryo, in this case it would result in another abortion if the next fetus Karin conceives carries the same genetic syndrome (Werdning Ho man syndrome) which resulted in the death of the couple s son. That abortion would have to take place at a later stage of pregnancy, at greater risk to the woman, and when the fetus is nearer viability. So it does seem that pragmatically, both opponents of abortion and proponents of a woman s right to choose might actually unite behind the couple s desire to use PGD. True, PGD entails the destruction of the embryos carrying the genetic con- dition; only embryos which are not a ected will be implanted in the woman s womb. But in the case of a genetic condition which inevitably results in the death of the baby once it is born, the child that the embryo would become is going to die anyway.\nIn this example, utilitarians and rights theorists who are just as unlikely bedfellows as pro-choice and anti-abortion advocates would probably agree that PGD should be o ered. A utilitarian, with a consequentialist emphasis on outcomes, might well accept the argument that the a ected embryo will die in any case, adding that the couple s welfare will obviously be enhanced if they don t have to undergo the painful process of another abortion. A rights theorist assuming she or he focuses on the rights of the woman rather than the right of the embryo would come to the same conclusion. Dr Frederick came to a similar view from a duty-based perspective. She felt that it was part of her duty as a doctor to take a compassionate attitude towards Karin and to recommend her for PGD abroad, regardless of what the law in their home country had to say. On the other hand, it would also be possible for a deontologist someone who focuses on",

    "case": "In this paper, I shall discuss the ethical dilemmas involved in counselling renal transplant patients seeking pregnancy but requiring ART. This case concerned a couple with long-standing infertility by means of IVF ET. The wife was a renal transplant recipient whose initial renal failure was due to severe, recurrent pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condi- tion of late pregnancy causing raised blood pressure and renal complications, which can progress to cause ts and cerebro-vascular accidents [strokes]. It is associated with severe growth retardation of the fetus, and often, premature delivery.\n\nA case of high-risk pregnancy\n\nA 34-year-old woman (Mrs A) was referred to an IVF unit following 8 years of failure to conceive after a reversal-of-sterilization operation had been performed (Lockwood et al., 1995). She had been born with only one poorly developed kidney, but this was not known until, at age 20, she was investigated for very severe pre-eclampsic toxaemia (PET), which she su ered during her rst pregnancy. Her baby was born very premature at 26 weeks gestation, and he died shortly after birth from complications of extreme prematurity.\n\nA second pregnancy in the following year was also complicated by severe PET, renal damage, pre- mature delivery at 26 weeks gestation and neonatal death. Sterilization by tubal ligation was o ered and accepted under these circumstances, in view of the anticipated further deterioration of her renal function with any subsequent pregnancy. There was a signi cant further advance of her renal disease, necessitating the initiation of haemodialysis (a kidney machine) 2 years later, and a living, related donor renal transplant (from her mother) was subsequently per- formed. After the transplant, Mrs A remained well and maintained good kidney function on a combination of anti-rejection drugs, steroids and blood pressure tablets. At age 26, a reversal-of-sterilization operation was performed because she had become so distressed by her childlessness, but hysterosalpingography (a test to check for fallopian tubal patency) 2 years later, when pregnancy had not occurred, showed that both tubes had once again become blocked.\n\nAt the time that Mr and Mrs A were referred to the IVF unit, there were no case reports of successful IVF in women with renal transplants, but specialists were becoming increasingly reluctant to advise women with transplants against trying for a baby, as medical care for high-risk pregnancies was improving dramatically. Following discussion with the Transplantation Unit and the high-risk pregnancy specialists, the IVF unit felt that an IVF treatment cycle could be o ered to Mr and Mrs A as long as the risks of IVF ET, over and above those attendant upon a spontaneous pregnancy in these circumstances, were understood and accepted by the couple and minimized, as far as possible, by the IVF team.\n\nAn IVF treatment cycle was started using the normal drug regimen, but the patient was given a much lower dose than usual, with the aim of minimizing the e ect of the hormone stimulation on the transplanted kidney. Two oocytes (eggs) were obtained, which fertilized normally in vitro, and the two embryos were transferred to the uterus (womb) 54 hours later. Mrs A s pregnancy test was positive 13 days after embryo transfer, and an ultrasound scan performed at 8 weeks gestation showed a viable twin pregnancy.\n\nThroughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, the patient s antirejection drugs (azathioprine and prednisolone) were continued at maintenance doses. Renal function was monitored closely throughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, remaining remarkably stable.\n\nThe pregnancy was complicated at 20 weeks gestation by a right deep vein thrombosis, a ecting the femoral and external iliac veins, and anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was required. Spontaneous rupture of the membranes, leading to premature delivery, occurred at 29 weeks gestation; the twins were delivered vaginally and in good condition three hours later. The twin girls were small for dates (at 1.48 and 1.19 kg) but were otherwise well, requiring only minimal resuscitation and respiratory support. After delivery of her babies, Mrs A remained well and her renal graft continued to function normally, with no change in immunosuppressive or antihypertensive medication required.",

    "case": "Section 1: Living with uncertainty - A case of breast cancer genetics\n\nPlease open scenario 2 on your CD-ROM, Genetic testing: breast cancer, and work through it, noting down your responses to the questions posed about clinical dilemmas as you go along. This case concerns a woman, Beth Brown, who receives a routine request to give samples, consent, confidentiality and ownership of genetic information are becoming important concerns for everyone. A high proportion of us will have donated tissue to a biobank, knowingly or unwittingly. What rights should we have to determine the uses made of that information? Is the traditional notion of informed consent a sufficient protection against uses we don’t want to see? What about use of genetic information by insurance firms or employers? What about commercial firms who profit from our tissue? Or even indigenous peoples who object to the use of their genome by Western biotechnology firms? In the third section of this chapter, we will ask how genetic databanking affects ethical decision-making in clinical practice, examining examples from the UK, USA and Iceland. We will investigate the way in which developing countries have reacted against the attempt by Western researchers and firms to colonize their often unique genetic resources. Beginning at the level of an individual family’s story, this section moves to global issues about genetic databanking and the difficult question of who, if anyone, owns the human genome.\n\nWhen you have finished, please return to this text.\n\nOne of the most difficult features of genetic testing for most conditions is that the information gained is so often imperfect. For example, breast cancer is a multifactorial disease, and only about 10% of cases are thought to be due to an inherited risk. Also, a positive test for the BRCA1 gene indicates an 80% chance of developing breast cancer by the age of 65, but not an absolute certainty of it. Another factor which has important ethical implications is the fact that it is possible for the results of tests for BRCA1 to be either falsely negative or falsely positive. In the light of these facts, should a genetic test like this be marketed as soon as possible or only when there is a proven treatment? A testing kit for the BRCA1 gene is currently available on the internet. Do you agree that the BRCA1 test should be openly available for those who want to use it? If not, why not?\n\nWe would now like you to read the following account by June Zatz of what it is like to live with the risk of developing breast cancer after having come across the information by chance. Although her initial contact with information about her risk did not come about through a genetics test, her case has interesting parallels with Mrs Brown’s. Ask yourself if there are particular ethical questions related to the availability of this kind of genetic information. What are the possible benefits and harms?\n\nACTIVITY: Awareness of genetic risk can arise in many different ways. As this case shows, the trigger may be discussion in the media, the sharing of information in families or a clinical diagnosis. Most clinical geneticists agree that when possible, genetic testing should be preceded and followed by counselling. Should such counselling be compulsory? Or, do you think that those who wish to take a genetic test ought to be able to do so freely, whether or not they want to have counselling? What are the ethical implications of this question?\n\nI am definitely having it done\n\nJune Zatz\n\nI remember in 1973, when I was 23 years old, sitting in the hairdresser’s, reading some obscure American magazine. I came across an article about a 19-year-old girl from New York where every female on her mother’s side had contracted breast cancer, going back two or three generations. A decision was taken that she have both breasts removed as this was the only way to ensure that she would not contract the disease herself. I was absolutely aghast when I read this article. This was the first time I learnt that breast cancer was hereditary. My mother, her two sisters and her first cousin had had breast cancer but I never really thought of it as being a threat to me. And the thought of a 19-year-old having such a drastic operation! I never discussed the article with anyone. It was after reading the article that the implications were clearer to me of contracting the disease. I dismissed as ridiculous the part in the article about the 19-year-old having such a drastic operation. I never discussed the article with anyone. It was after reading the article that the implications were clearer to me of contracting the disease. I dismissed as ridiculous the part in the article about the 19-year-old having such a drastic operation. I never discussed the article with anyone. It was after reading the article that the implications were clearer to me of contracting the disease.\n\nMy mother had a radical mastectomy when she was 42 years old. As a result of the operation she was left with fluid in her right arm, which caused severe infections where she was bedridden for days. She had bouts of ill-health for years but in between she was a determined lady who never complained. She had a second mastectomy 13 years later followed by various operations and bouts of ill-health. After a benign tumour was removed from her liver when she was 58, her consultant warned my brother and me that cancer will get her sooner rather than later. Her ultimate illness was when she was 66 years old, short and sharp cancer of the spine, paralysis, painful death; even now, 7 years later, I cannot think of this period without immense pain.\n\nMy mother’s younger sister developed breast cancer when she was 46, and after numerous operations and great pain died 2 years later when 48 years old. This was prior to the days of the hospice (where my mother died) and so my mother looked after her, but the pain was not well controlled. My other aunt died when I was only 7 years old. My mother told me she had breast cancer in her early 40s, but also had a heart condition from which she died in her mid-40s.\n\nAs I neared the age when my mother developed her first breast cancer, I became more fearful. Over the years I had read many articles and I did not feel that treatments were any more effective today than years ago, even if it were detected at an earlier stage. I felt that I would get breast cancer as my body was similar to my mother’s in many ways – she had fibroids and a hysterectomy; she had gall stones and had her gall bladder removed. I had had both these operations by my late 30s. My mind kept casting back to the article I’d read all those years ago about the 19-year-old who had both breasts removed as a preventative measure. I had never read of this again but decided it was time to pursue it further. In April 1992 I made the decision to have the operation.\n\nIn the summer of 1991 I wrote to my oncologist asking if such an operation were possible. His answer took a fairly long time coming, mainly due to administrative procedures. While I waited for the reply, I was on tenterhooks: my feelings were that I would be told that I was crazy, that this operation could be done only in America. While I waited for the reply, I was on tenterhooks: my feelings were that I would be told that I was crazy, that this operation could be done only in America. One of the most difficult features of genetic testing for most conditions is that the information gained is so often imperfect. For example, breast cancer is a multifactorial disease, and only about 10% of cases are thought to be due to an inherited risk. Also, a positive test for the BRCA1 gene indicates an 80% chance of developing breast cancer by the age of 65, but not an absolute certainty of it.\n\nEventually when his letter arrived stating that yes, I could have this operation I literally couldn’t believe it. I read the letter over and over for days. Then I wrote another long letter with lots of questions. There followed several letters to and fro: a referral to a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstruction and a referral to a specialist cancer geneticist to discuss the genetic side of things.\n\nIt took me months to make up my mind definitely. After the second letter from the oncologist, I told my husband what I was investigating and he was horrified. He just could not understand why I should have both breasts removed when they were perfectly healthy. To him the logical thing was to wait and, if the cancer appeared, then it will have been caught early, then I should have a mastectomy. He didn’t understand that, the way I saw it, it was too late by then. At this stage, however, I hadn’t made up my mind and in fact because of my husband’s attitude I put things on hold for several weeks. One day, however, I woke up early feeling such anger and resentment towards him – he and I had always until now agreed on major issues.\n\nI discussed it with him again. This time I had a different attitude: he had made me feel selfish contemplating such an operation but what I said to him was: What about me, my fears; this is my life and who’s going to look after me if I get cancer – will he nurse me? At the same time I said I hadn’t yet made up my mind but I was going to continue my investigations whether he liked it or not. He listened and said he’d like to come with me when I next had a consultation with either the oncologist or the plastic surgeon. I refused as I knew he was still against it but said I’d tell him everything they said.\n\nSome days I would wake up and say, I’m definitely having it done. Other days I’d think I was crazy – I tried to imagine what it would be like without breasts, although there was the chance of reconstruction. Gradually my husband came round to my way of things. The more information I gathered the more he understood what I could be facing. One day I said, I don’t think I’ll have it done, and then to my surprise he said, You should go ahead – I’d rather have you alive and well with no breasts.\n\nFrom the time of making my decision in April 1992 I never looked back once. Now I had to decide when to tell people because I’d be in hospital for 2 weeks and off work for a couple of months. I had lunch with a close friend and started to tell her. She was so aghast that I didn’t finish telling her about the reconstruction. I couldn’t wait to get away from her. She just couldn’t hide her feelings. After this I told a few more people but got more or less the same reaction. I was furious and upset. The way I saw it I had made a very difficult decision and these supposed close friends were completely unsympathetic. They made comments like Do you know what you are doing? or Why remove your breasts when you haven’t got cancer?\n\nI told my doctor friend who had known from the beginning and she said, They’re so busy trying to deal with their own feelings that they can’t focus on you and provide support for you. I realized just what a threat this seemed to be to other women to have one’s breasts removed. I told my husband I couldn’t tell anyone else so he said to make a list and he would sit down and phone them. I gave him half a dozen names and he did it immediately as I didn’t want these people to find out from others. Needless to say I received a few phone calls from people we’d not told, to say that they’d heard about it; again they were very unsupportive. Despite the lack of help I never faltered.\n\nThe only people who knew about it were my husband, my two children and two friends, one of whom had a medical background and the other was a cousin to whom I’m very close and with whom I’d often discussed the family history. I instinctively knew from the beginning that I didn’t want anyone’s advice on the matter, I wanted facts on which I could base my decision. The professionals were wonderful. Everyone was patient, answered my questions, was quietly supportive and never offered advice on what I should do. There’s no way the outcome wo\n...[TRUNCATED]",

(This is no longer the particularly difficult both because of the interpersonal/intergenerational nature of the information provided and also because in many cases, as in the case of the BRCA1 gene, the information is statistical and not easy to translate into action. Not all genetic tests are like this, however. In the case of Huntington's disease, a positive test does mean that the test subject will develop the condition at some point and that their children will have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene. As we will be going on to see in the next section, such tests raise ethical questions of their own. You saw in the CD-ROM case that Mrs Brown's daughters, Rebecca and Laura, were contemplating taking the genetic test for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, regardless of whatever their mother decided about having the test herself. But if their results came back positive, that would have revealed information about their mother's status so she would have known the truth whether she liked it or not. What does this aspect of genetics imply about an individual's right to know, or her autonomy? In the next section we will examine that question in greater detail.\n\nACTIVITY: How does Henry's case compare with those of June Satz and Beth Brown? Information and access issues seem crucial here, the cause of conflict within the family. How can they be resolved?\n\nIn contrast to the first section, on ethical dilemmas raised by the uncertainty more characteristic of genetic testing, Henry's case demonstrates the troubling consequences of a greater degree of certainty. Because Huntington's disease is an autosomal dominant condition (see the glossary on the CD-ROM), caused by mutations on a single gene rather than the many genes typically involved in other genetic conditions, the choice faced by Henry's descendants is particularly clear and stark. That does not necessarily make the ethical choices any easier, for example in the effects on Henry's grandchildren.\n\nThis scenario concerns Henry, a 73-year-old man who was diagnosed with depression and then with atypical Alzheimer's disease. But Henry's symptoms were still not fully explained, and his dementia was now so severe that communication with him was effectively impossible. The family history, however, included members who had manifested jerky movements or dementia late in life. This suggested a possible genetic link. In conversation with a researcher from a project on memory and ageing, the general practitioner involved in Henry's care learned that a new testing procedure could determine accurately whether Henry might have Huntington's disease (HD), an incurable progressive disease of the central nervous system. The testing procedure, based on the number of repeats of the gene for HD, would only be available if Henry was enrolled on the research project. The family agreed, and Henry tested positive for Huntington's disease 10 days before his death. But it turned out that Henry's family hadn't really understood the implications for themselves of allowing him to be tested. Huntington's is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that Henry's children would have roughly 50/50 chances of developing the condition themselves. Henry's wife Mary now wanted everyone in the family to be tested for HD, including her grandchildren (who would have a 1 in 4 chance of developing HD). Ann was willing to be tested herself, but Peter was adamantly against finding out his genetic status or allowing his wife Ruth to learn about Henry's test results, even though he and his wife already had two young children, and might have more.\n\nShould the eldest grandchild, Tom, have the right to know his genetic status even though he isn't yet 18? Or is it more important to protect the grandchildren's right to an untroubled, open childhood, and maintain the option for them to make their own choice about whether or not to be tested in the future? There is no cure currently possible for Huntington's disease, so on an ethical consequentialist basis, knowing one's diagnosis does no therapeutic good. (Consequentialists stress the importance of maximizing beneficial outcomes, and would probably say that truth-telling is not an absolute principle in itself.) Furthermore, the grandchildren may well not carry the mutation; should",

    "case": "The case of Debbie and Daniel Greenberg\n\nDebbie and Daniel Greenberg had lost two children to the rare but fatal genetic condition Canavan disease, a degenerative brain disorder which primarily affects people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. As with the commoner genetic condition cystic fibrosis and other recessive conditions, and unlike autosomal dominant disorders such as Huntington's disease, parents can carry one copy of the gene without knowing it, because they will have no symptoms themselves. But if two carriers have children, each child has a one in four chance of inheriting two Canavan's genes and developing the fatal brain disorder.\n\nAfter the deaths of their children Jonathan and Amy, the Greenbergs contacted a genetic researcher, Dr Reuben Matalon, and urged him to begin research into the genetic basis of Canavan disease. They hoped he and his colleagues could develop a genetic test which could prevent other parents from suffering as they had done, by identifying carriers of the condition and giving them the chance to decide on having their children through IVF and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. With the aid of over 160 other affected families, the Greenbergs founded a genetic tissue and data bank, working collaboratively with Dr Matalon over a period of 13 years and contributing not only post-mortem tissue from their children, but also their time and financial support. 'All the time we viewed it as a partnership,' Daniel Greenberg said.\n\nThey were mistaken. Without the Greenbergs' knowledge, the hospital at which Dr Matalon worked took out a comprehensive patent in 1997: US patent number 5,679,635, covering the gene coding for Canavan disease, diagnostic screening methods, and kits for carrier and antenatal testing. Two years later the hospital began to collect royalties for the patented genetic test, claiming that as a non-profit-making body ironically enough it needed to recoup its outlay on research. The genuinely charitable Canavan Foundation had been sponsoring testing for all couples of Ashkenazi Jewish descent who requested it, but now it could no longer afford to do so. Furthermore, the hospital imposed restrictions on which laboratories were allowed to administer the test, limiting access for many patients. Children who would suffer from Canavan disease were now being born unnecessarily, to a short life of suffering precisely the outcome the Greenbergs had hoped to avoid for other families. In fact, it would have been better if they had never taken the initiative to get research started on the disease that killed their children. Now doctors were even being barred by the terms of the patent from diagnosing Canavan disease through more traditional methods not involving genetic testing.\n\nIn October 2000, the Greenbergs and other Canavan parents filed a lawsuit in a US court, alleging lack of informed consent to the further uses that had been made of their children's tissue. In addition to the consent issue, however, they argued that they had a right to determine what uses were made of the tissue and data which they had laboured to collect over so many years. This was very directly a case about who owns genetic information: the patient, patient's family, researchers or hospital? The Greenbergs also complained that Dr Matalon and his colleagues were in breach of their fiduciary duty of care, and that they had enriched themselves at the families' expense. They argued that if they had known that Matalon and the hospital intended to patent and commercialize the discovery, they would never have contributed time, money and tissue samples. Matalon's taking out a patent was common enough—some one in five of all human genes is now the subject of a patent—but on the other hand, the researchers who discovered the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis deliberately eschewed restrictive patents and licensing agreements on their discovery.\n\nThree years later, the case was settled, largely in Matalon's favour. The Greenbergs lost their claim that no informed consent had been given, because neither they nor the other Canavan families were Matalon's patients. This was not a one-to-one therapeutic relationship, and so neither informed consent nor the duties of a doctor had been breached, according to the court judgement. Medical law, which does tend to focus narrowly on the doctor patient dyad, was too rigidly individualistic to take the weight the Greenbergs wanted to place on it. The only point on which the families won was the unjust enrichment claim, but not because Matalon had taken what was rightfully theirs: the court accepted that the hospital was the rightful owner of the patent, and that the patent was itself lawful. All the court did was to impose a set of minor restrictions on its use so that other researchers could have access to the genetic information and to award the families a very small sum in settlement of the unjust enrichment claim. In return for these concessions, the Greenbergs and the other families had to agree not to challenge the hospital's ownership of the patent.",

    "case": "The case of HIV drug trials in developing countries\n\nBetween 1995 and 1997, a programme of 15 trials on maternal fetal transmission of HIV, coordinated by UNAIDS, was carried out on 12 000 women in various parts of the developing world (Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, Uganda, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya and Burkina Faso). The research was conducted by researchers funded by the USA, France, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa. At that time it was estimated by the National Institutes of Health that there would soon be 6 million pregnant women in the developing world infected with HIV. Maternal infant transmission of HIV occurred in approximately 15% of cases, with approximately 1000 HIV-positive babies born each day.\n\nA particular regimen of the antiretroviral drug zidovudine had been shown by research in the USA and in France to reduce the risk of such transmission by up to 66%. The triple combination regimen, involving three stages (oral doses whilst pregnant, intravenous doses during labour and further oral doses, for the child, up until six weeks after birth), was claimed to be too expensive for widespread use in the developing world [$800 per mother and infant according to Varmus and Satcher (1997). This was 600 times the annual per capita allocation for healthcare in Malawi]. Were it possible to develop an effective regimen of the drug which was less expensive than triple combination therapy and cheap enough for widespread use in the developing world, it would clearly have the potential to avoid the infection of a very large number of babies. In order to investigate the success of a lower dosage of the drug, researchers considered two alternative study designs. The first approach considered was to run a trial comparing a new cheaper regimen with placebo. The second approach considered was to compare the new regimen with triple combination therapy.\n\nIt was the first approach that was adopted in these trials. That meant that only half of the HIV-positive women actually received the drug regime, with the other half receiving a placebo. Had the trials been carried out in the developed world, they would have been considered unethical. The Declaration of Helsinki in its then-current (1989) version stated that ‘The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods’. However, given the absence of any such treatment locally, the researchers felt that the trials were justified because, without them, the women who received the reduced dose therapy and those who received the placebo would both have received nothing. The trial, it was claimed, would leave no one worse off than they would otherwise have been: some women would receive treatment they would not otherwise have had, and those who received placebos would be no worse off than they would otherwise have been. The researchers also argued that a placebo-controlled trial would produce results more quickly than a treatment-controlled approach.\n\nIn an influential article which originally appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine, two prominent critics, Peter Lurie and Sidney M. Wolfe, argued that these trials were indeed unethical, falling below the standard of the Declaration of Helsinki (Lurie and Wolfe, 1997). While they recognized that both critics and opponents of these trials agreed that perinatal HIV transmission was a grave international problem, that there was a role for research on this topic in developing countries, that finding cheaper interventions would benefit those countries hugely and that randomized trials were an effective way of identifying such interventions, they viewed the crucial ethical issue dividing them from proponents of the trials as the composition of the control or comparison group.\n\nAs Lurie and Wolfe wrote, ‘The researchers conducting the placebo-controlled trials assert that such trials represent the only appropriate research design, implying that they answer the question, Is the shorter regimen better than nothing? We take the more optimistic view that, given the findings of ACTG 076 [the zidovudine regimen trials] and other clinical information, researchers are quite capable of designing a shorter antiretroviral regimen that is approximately as effective as the ACTG 076 regimen. We believe that such equivalency studies of alternative antiretroviral regimens will provide even more useful results than placebo-controlled trials, without the deaths of hundreds of newborns that are inevitable if placebo groups are used’ (Lurie and Wolfe, 1997, p. 854). They continued, ‘If the research can be satisfactorily conducted in more than one way, why not select the approach that minimizes loss of life?’ (Lurie and Wolfe, 1997, p. 854).\n\nAccording to Lurie and Wolfe, researchers working in the Third World are ethically obliged to provide treatment for control groups that corresponds with the standard of care in the sponsoring country, even if the standard of care in the country where the trials are being held is lower. (The only exception would be a trial that required massive infrastructure expenditure say, building a new coronary care unit in a hospital.) Otherwise we risk enshrining double standards in research, Lurie and Wolfe asserted, with one standard for the rich world and another for the poor. They also pointed out that in any case, zidovudine was normally made available free of charge by the... \n\nACTIVITY: Before you go on, stop here for a moment and, imagine that you are a member of the ethics committee that had to decide whether or not to approve this project.

    "case": "The case of Mr AB\n\nCentral to Mr AB's case are questions about autonomy and mental competence, which we will further explore by returning to the case of Mr C, whom we encountered in the first chapter, on decisions at the end of life. The autonomy of the psychiatric patient is a core theme in the ethics of mental healthcare. As such, in the second section of this chapter, we move to examine ideas associated with autonomy, like the freedom or liberty of a psychiatric patient and the limits (if any) that can be placed on his or her freedom (such as through involuntary treatment or hospitalization). The boundaries of autonomy also feature in the third section, which focuses upon the mental health of children and young people. In that section, as in the previous one, we will explore the tensions that can arise between protecting the patient's autonomy and protecting their welfare.\n\nMr AB was a 90-year-old man who suffered from dementia. After several years of being cared for at home by his wife, Mr AB was finally admitted to a special care unit in northern Italy because his wife no longer felt able to bear the demands which caring for her husband placed upon her.\n\nOn admission to the unit, a clinical and multidimensional evaluation of Mr AB's condition revealed him to be severely cognitively impaired and to be extremely frail as a result of malnutrition. Mr AB was capable to some limited extent of walking and also of eating but was dependent upon others in virtually every other respect. Although he was able to walk, Mr AB found balance very difficult and needed the support of a carer. The doctors who saw him also recorded that he had severe behaviour disorders associated with dementia, such as anxiety and agitation.\n\nThe physician responsible for Mr AB's care designed a walking rehabilitation programme for him and the nurses in the unit tried to improve his nutritional status by means of personal care and attention during meal times and by the use of nutritional supplements. It was also decided to reduce the levels of psychotropic drugs with which Mr AB had been treated while he was living at home.\n\nAfter 20 days of treatment at the special care unit, Mr AB's cognitive and functional status had improved dramatically and he was now able to walk alone, without help. His behaviour disorders were also less severe and disturbing (especially his anxiety and agitation) despite the fact that his treatment with psychotropic drugs had been reduced.\n\nAfter 35 days at the unit, however, Mr AB developed a fever and cough which became progressively worse. This was diagnosed as pneumonia. As a result of the pneumonia, Mr AB became much more confused again and was no longer able to walk. He also lost the ability to feed himself. All this resulted in a dramatic and serious decline in Mr AB's health. It was felt that Mr AB's life would be at risk unless his pneumonia was treated and he received some nutrition.\n\nAfter discussing the patient's condition with his wife, the physician started treating Mr AB intravenously with fluids and also with antibiotics. However, during attempts to administer intravenous drugs Mr AB became very irritable and agitated. He also refused food during assisted meals.\n\nAfter further consultation with Mr AB's wife, short-term physical restraints were adopted by the hospital staff, both during the administration of drugs and during assisted meals. After 2 weeks Mr AB recovered from pneumonia and returned to his previous daily nourishment and drug therapy.",

    "case": "The case of Mr C\n\nMr C, a 68-year-old patient suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, developed gangrene in a foot during his confinement in a secure hospital. He was removed to a general hospital, where the consultant surgeon diagnosed that he was likely to die imminently if the leg was not amputated below the knee. The prognosis was that he had a 15% chance of survival without amputation. Mr C refused to consider amputation. The hospital authorities considered whether the operation could be performed without Mr C's consent and made arrangements for a solicitor to see him concerning his competence to give a reasoned decision. In the meantime, treatment with antibiotics and conservative surgery averted the immediate threat of imminent death, but the hospital refused to give an understanding to the solicitor that in recognition of his repeated refusals it would not amputate in any future circumstances. There was a possibility that Mr C would develop gangrene again. An application was made on Mr C's behalf to the court for an injunction restraining the hospital from carrying out an amputation without his express written consent. On behalf of the hospital it was contended that Mr C's capacity to give a definitive decision had been impaired by his mental illness and that he had failed to appreciate the risk of death if the operation was not performed. (Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) [1994] 1 All ER 819.)\n\nNow consider the following additional facts. Which, if any, is relevant?\n\n* Mr C had emigrated from Jamaica in 1956, with his passage paid by the woman with whom he had lived since 1949. He stabbed her after she left him in 1961.\n* Since that time Mr C had been confined either in prison or in a secure hospital.\n* For the past six years he had been accommodated in an open ward and was described as having mellowed, having become more sociable and even-tempered.\n* Mr C was very adept with finances; he had saved all of his earnings during his 30 years time in the secure hospital.\n* When his solicitor asked him to whom he intended to leave his savings, he replied I'll leave it for myself, for when I come back.\n* Mr C's delusions included the belief that he was a world-famous vascular surgeon who had never lost a patient.\n* Mr C also believed that his doctors were torturers.\n* Mr C's refusal of amputation reflected his religious convictions, although it was not part of a formal creed.",

After spending many years in a psychiatric hospital, Mr L lived with foster carers for three years. Whilst attending a day centre, he became extremely agitated. Sta were unable to contact his carers, and Mr L was informally admitted to hospital. Mr L was unable to speak, so that he had no ability to commu- nicate consent or dissent to hospital admission, but his consultant concluded that Mr L s apparent com- pliance rendered formal admission unnecessary.\n\nWhilst he was being assessed, Mr L was denied access to his foster carers, on the grounds that he might attempt to leave with them before he was t for discharge. The European Court of Human Rights decided the that this amounted to a deprivation of Mr L s liberty. The judges noted that Mr L had no recourse to the protections o ered by the Mental Health Act 1983, such as the ability to challenge his detention and the restrictions on treatment. The lack of procedural safe- guards and access to the court amounted to a breach of article 5.",

    "case": "The Case of W\nW , aged 16, was orphaned at the age of eight, when\nher mother died of cancer. Three years earlier, her\nfather had died of a brain tumour. Together with her\nbrother and sister, W was taken into the care of the\nlocal authority; her aunt, who had been named as\ntestamentary guardian, was unable to care for the\nchildren. After a foster placement broke down, she\nwas moved to a second family, but her new foster\nmother developed breast cancer. Her grandfather,\nto whom she was very attached, died shortly thereafter,\nwhen W was 13. A few months later W began losing\nweight; she had been su ering from depression and a\nnervous tic for some time before, and she was\nreferred for her eating disorder to the same clinic\nwhich had been treating her other conditions. But\nsessions with a clinical psychologist at the clinic did\nnot really resolve the problems, and shortly before\nher 15th birthday W was admitted on an inpatient\nbasis to a specialist London residential unit for chil-\ndren and adolescents. Here she began injuring herself\nby picking at her skin and other forms of self-harm. A\nfew months later her condition had deteriorated to\nthe point where she had to be fed by nasogastric\ntube, to which she consented; her arms were encased\nin plaster to prevent her picking at her skin.\nThe local authority decided to move W to another\ntreatment unit, to which W was opposed. She had\ndeveloped a good relationship with sta at the rst\ncentre, she argued although it was also true that she\nhad occasionally been violent towards sta there.\nHowever, the original treatment centre wanted to\ncontinue working with W and opposed the move.\nHer weight was now stable at about seven stone. In\nMarch 1992 W reached the age of 16 and exercised\nher right to be represented by a solicitor of her own\nchoice. Under the provisions of the Family Law\nReform Act 1969, which treats the treatment choices\nof 16- and 17-year-olds as equally valid to an adult s,\nit appeared that W would have the right to refuse the\ntransfer. The authority made a formal application to\nthe High Court to test whether this was so, requesting\nleave to move W to a named treatment centre without\nher consent, and to give her whatever treatment the\nnew centre deemed necessary, also without her\nconsent.\nThe High Court ruled that W was competent, with\nMr Justice Thorpe also the judge in the C case\nstating: There is no doubt at all that [W] is a child of\nsu cient understanding to make an informed deci-\nsion. This was consistent with the evidence of Dr G,\na consultant psychiatrist specializing in anorexia\nnervosa, who noted: I am convinced that she has a good\nintelligence, and understands what is proposed as\ntreatment. It might seem, therefore, that because W\nwas competent, she would be allowed to refuse both\ntransfer to the second centre and the blank cheque\nwhich the authority was seeking for her treatment and\neven forcible feeding, is medical treatment rather than\npsychiatric treatment, and that she should have been\nallowed to refuse it, in the same way that Mr C was\nallowed to refuse amputation. But because there is a\npresumption of incompetence for minors under 18,\nthis was not the case. W had no right to say no, it was\nheld in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal.\n(Re W, p. 637).",

    "case": "The case of Miss A\n\n' Miss A su ered from borderline personality dis- ' order. In childhood, she had experienced pro- longed and extensive sexual abuse by her father. As a result, she su ered from depression, and intermittent feelings of loathing towards her own body, which resulted in acts of deliberate self-harm and episodes of self-starvation. She was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and over a long period of time developed a reasonable relationship with her male psychiatrist, who was concerned for her welfare.\nDuring one admission (after a period of years), Miss A s weight began to drop so dramatically that her doctor threatened to force-feed her in order to save her life. She went to court to get an injunction to prevent him from doing so. The dilemma here for both the patient and the doctor is obvious. Respecting her autonomy may result in her acting so riskily to herself that she su ers harm, and dies.\nIt may be relevant when contemplating this dilemma to consider how force-feeding is a symbolic re-enactment of the original abuse (she was subjected to forced fellatio over a period of time). The experience of child abuse frequently leaves individuals with real concerns about the extent to which they are in control of their own bodies even if retaining control incurs risk. A relevant issue is that of Miss A s self con- cept, i.e. her attitudes of herself towards herself (Attanucci, 1988). Her own ambivalence about herself ( I don t matter I do matter ) was mirrored in the attitudes of sta , who alterna- tively saw her as incompetent to care for herself and needing to be force-fed; or as manipulative and trying to bully them. This mirroring also replicated the relationship between herself and her parents. Legal argument focused on her competence to make decisions and refuse help (but that will not be examined here).\n\nOn a rights/principles perspective, or even a utilitarian analysis, there is a tension between Miss A s view of what was right for her, and the sta s view. A broader view of her welfare, to which included thinking about her past, and present relationships with caretakers, might understand the dilemma as part of the concern that abused adults have about their control over their own bodies. By supporting her at these times when she was at her most self-destructive, it might be more possible to understand her self-destruction (and thus her ethical con ict with sta ) as a response to her own previous experiences of abuse. Time could also be o ered to sta to explore their feelings about Miss A, which might help to reduce the tension between them, and help them to feel less threatened by Miss A s expression of autonomy.",

He allows his mother to do things for him that he is capable of doing; he is also ambivalent about going out, expressing concerns about others response to his disability. His mother supports him in his reluctance, and suggests that it is too di cult for him to go out. Attempts to increase his opportunities for social- ization (money for taxis, identi cation of peer groups) are met with verbal aggression by his mother, and benign sabotage on the part of the patient. The young man s family appears to be connected together by his disability so that attempts to rehabilitate him out of the house, which would indeed do him some good, seem to cause distress within the family system. Active interventions to motivate him may actually do him harm, in the sense that they disarrange a com- plex family dynamic.\nChanging that family dynamic requires a subtle assessment of harms and bene ts, and an understanding of the relationships between all members of the family. A less subtle analysis of harms and bene ts, which focused on only the young man s physical context and not his emotional one, may lead to di culties, and clinical failure. Such failures are not uncommon, particularly in the area of psychiatric care in the community, and may re ect the lack of training which clinicians receive, both about the scope and nature of their ethical duties and the nature of relationships between people (Carse, 1991).",

    "case": "The case of Mrs B\nMrs B, who suffers from moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease, frequently wanders from the nursing home where she is living. She has poor tra c sense. Not long ago, she wandered out into the road. A car swerved to avoid her and crashed into a tree. The driver su ered mild bruising and was very shaken, but was not seriously hurt.\nBut although truth-telling and negotiation are not so much the issue here as in the previous example, autonomy is still relevant. English law is nowadays particularly alert to the need to justify any interference with autonomy, in the sense of a deprivation of liberty, and the law includes safeguards for protecting the interests of incompetent patients (e.g. Gunn, 2009). Yet, even if we might legally be entitled to restrain Mrs B, this does not mean that we can easily do away with the ethical issues (e.g. Nu eld Council on Bioethics, 2009, pp. 105 9). Barring Mrs B from walking around the grounds is likely to feel like imprisoning her to her carers, whether it is done by means of a locked door, sedation or tracking devices. It feels like a signi cant invasion of her rights, even though she is almost certainly not competent (Gastmans and Milisen, 2006; Sammet, 2007). There are risks of elder abuse if such strategies are followed too frequently, and most professionals are sensitive to this indeed, it is notable that the American Psychiatric Association et al. (2003) have issued a special publication aimed at reducing restraint and seclusion. However, as Tony Hope s analysis below demonstrates, they may not feel they can let their sensitivity be the only consideration.\nACTIVITY: Consider how you would act in this case if you were responsible for Mrs B s care? Jot down some possible options and the arguments for and against them.\n\nThe case of Mr A\n‘I m a lot better driver than all those young lunatics!’\nMr A s daughter interrupted at this point to describe two small car accidents which her father had recently caused. Mr A then announced, out of the blue, that he had just decided to buy a new car. If there was any problem, it lay in the old car, not in his driving.\nMr A s wife and daughter agreed between themselves that the only possible solution was to hide the car keys. But Mr A managed to locate them, and drove o to a reunion of his railway colleagues without any incident. When he returned, it was with a new copy of the car keys, and a bad mood that lasted for days at home. Mr A s wife has now lost any will to prevent her husband from driving: she can t bear his anger, she says, and in any case he was perfectly all right last time he drove. Perhaps he doesn t have dementia after all, she remarked to the doctor on her own next visit to his surgery.\nIn balancing best interests, the degrees of risk and harm need to be weighed against the distress caused by restraint and the loss of pleasure due to the loss of freedom. In my view, arguments against the use of restraints either on the grounds of loss of dignity or on the grounds that it is important for people with dementia to be given the same freedom as normal people should not be given much weight. It could be argued that restraining Mrs B constitutes an abuse. Alternatively, it could be argued that allowing her to wander, risking grave harm, is also a form of abuse an example of neglect.\nBut what about cases in which the patient is less obviously incompetent, although the risks of harm are just as serious? Take the case of Mr A, summarized below.\nMr A is a 72-year-old retired railway conductor who lives with his wife in the house of their 43-year-old daughter and her family. Still active on the family smallholding, he is increasingly frustrated by di culties in operating machinery and in nding his way about the house. Accompanied by his wife and daughter, he visited Dr B s clinic for memory disturbance, where he was diagnosed with hypertension, arteriosclerotic occlusive disease, and multiple subcortical perivascular lesions on a computer scan of his brain. The overall diagnosis was subcortical vascular dementia with a moderate degree of impairment. It emerged that Mr A also had considerable impairment of his short-term memory (e.g. telephone numbers) and long-term recall (e.g. names of old friends). However, he denied strenuously that his mental powers were in any way impaired.\nIn the course of the consultation, Dr B asked Mr A whether he drove a car. Mr A replied that he did, and Dr B warned him that he should stop, from a medical point of view because of his memory impairment. Mr A absolutely refused to consider stopping: he was in perfectly good health, he insisted, and still very t. Dr B s options range from doing nothing to full-scale psychiatric interventions. In between lies the option of reporting Mr B to the driver licensing authorities, on the grounds that he is a danger to others. However, that would raise issues about con dentiality in the doctor patient relationship. This is one element in the reasoning which might enter into Dr B s decision: that information obtained in the course of doctor patient consultation is normally private, and that it would be wrong to reveal it to the licensing authorities.\nOther limitations on absolute con dentiality may occur in cases of child abuse or of dangerous psychiatric patients being discharged into the community: here again, disclosure of con dential information may be permitted. (See, for example, an English case involving a patient in a secure hospital who challenged disclosure of a con dential psychiatric report on his dangerousness to the medical director of the hospital and to the Home O ce: W v. Egdell, 1990.) UK case law holds that professionals may disclose con f idences in order to protect the public, provided that these conditions are satis ed:\n* There must be a real and serious danger to the public.\n* The risk must be an ongoing one.\n* Disclosure must be to a person or body with a legitimate interest in receiving the information.\n* Disclosure must be strictly limited to the information about risk, not all the patient s details.\n(Herring, 2008, pp. 211 12)\nWhat lies behind the general duty of con dentiality? (Even if Dr B can legally breach that duty after further attempts to persuade Mr A to stop driving voluntarily it is not a duty lightly to be broken.) We might seem to be back with the principles of autonomy versus beneficence again, as we were in one possible interpretation of the case of Mr D in the previous section. That is, Mr A s autonomy, his right to judge his own competence to drive and the freedom which driving brings, would have to be balanced against enhancing public safety by reporting him. This is certainly one set of considerations that Dr B might be considering. But we saw in the previous section that there are alternative ways of thinking, too: in that case, involving truth-telling, in terms of validation versus Reality Orientation Therapy.\nACTIVITY: How would you analyse this case? Think in terms of (a) the possible decisions which Dr B could take and (b) the reasoning behind those decisions.",

It is apparent that Lisa falsely believes that Martin is her husband and that Martin, also falsely, believes that Lisa is his wife.\nThis poses several problems for the staff. On the one hand there is the ethical question raised earlier in the first section of this chapter of whether they ought to adopt a reality orientation approach or one based on validation. That is, should they encourage the two residents to confront the truth about their relationship or should they respect and validate their feelings and the meaning the relationship has for them? On the other hand, in the case of Lisa and Martin there is a much more pressing ethical dilemma for the staff. For whilst Lisa's husband is in fact deceased, Martin's wife is not and comes to visit him on average once a week. This causes practical as well as ethical problems for the staff. When Martin's wife visits him he sometimes recognizes her, but sometimes he does not. This naturally upsets his wife. Martin's wife does not appear to know about the relationship between Martin and Lisa. When she comes to visit, the staff who work in the home try to make sure that Lisa is out or engaged in some activity in another room in order to avoid a confrontation. The problem with this is that Martin and Lisa desperately want to be together and protest when they are separated.\nThe staff do not know what to do. This is not, they feel, simply a matter of whether or not they should keep Martin's wife in the dark; it affects every aspect of managing the home. At bed time, for example, Martin and Lisa want to sleep together. They have said this when their respective children have been to visit them and the children have told the staff that such behaviour cannot be allowed.\nThus far, the staff who work in the home have respected the wishes of the children and have separated Martin and Lisa at bed times despite loud protests. The staff find this very upsetting when they see just how unhappy Lisa and Martin are but find it very difficult to know what they ought to do.\nACTIVITY: Do you think that there are any morally relevant differences between the case of Lisa and Martin and that of Carla and Stefan? We may be tempted to disapprove of Carla and Stefan's relationship but even if this were the case, we would most likely consider it wrong to tear Carla and Stefan apart. In the case of Lisa and Martin, however, the staff consider this an option. Why is this a possibility in one case and not in the other? Tony Hope goes on to compare the two cases.\nACTIVITY: Stop here for a moment and consider what ought to be done in the case of Lisa and Martin. Make a list of arguments for and against allowing Lisa and Martin to continue their relationship. When you have done this, go on to read the British psychiatrist and medical ethicist Tony Hope’s commentary for the case, picking out the arguments he uses and adding them to your list. We will return to these lists at the end of the section.",

    "case": "In the case of Lisa and Martin, there are further circumstances, the critical one being that Martin is now su ering from dementia. It seems to me that this fact of dementia is potentially relevant in two ways. The rst comes back to the question of compe- tence. That is, a reason why we should respect his previous and not his current wishes is that his pre- vious wishes were made when competent. This raises problems to do with establishing what exactly competence means in these circumstances. The second difference is to say that he is now ill and his relationship with Lisa is a direct result of the illness. In order for this to be a reason for countermanding his current desires it would have to be further argued that the illness has interfered with his true self. On this analysis his views prior to dementia represent his true views which have been obscured by the dementia. In the present case we do not have this clear evidence of what Martin s and Lisa s views about the current circumstances would have been. We might try to establish what their views would have been, although, clearly the families accounts are unlikely to be objective on this matter. So where does this leave us with regard to what the sta should do? I think what it shows is that, in order to justify interference with the relationship between Lisa and Martin all of a number of statements would need to be considered true: (1) That Lisa and Martin would have wanted their relationship to be broken, had they been asked about this situation before the onset of dementia. (2) That such critical interests should trump their experiential interests. (3) Either that Lisa and Martin are now incompetent with regard to the understanding of their relationship with each other; or that sense can be made of a distinction between a true self and a false self, and that the true self is represented by their pre-dementia state. Each of these statements is problematic, and I think therefore, the balance lies on the side of allowing the relationship to continue (whilst trying to minimize the distress to the family).",

    "case": "The case of Emmi\n\nEmmi is 85 years old and lives in a nursing home, suffering from the effect of two serious strokes. She has always been very particular about her appearance. Even now she continues to wear nice clothes and make up, despite the weakness in her left side.\n\nRecently she suffered a further stroke which left her with a lasting paralysis of the throat. It has become necessary to change Emmi's diet and to feed her only pureed food. Despite this the food still often gets caught in her throat. Emmi feels ashamed about this and about the way she appears when eating in company with the others who live in the home.\n\nAt a recent staff meeting, one of the workers thought it might help if Emmi could be fed in her room. Other workers felt, however, that she should come out and eat with the others, as not to do so would mean isolating herself. It was decided that the head nurse would speak to the other residents. They said that they thought it was disgusting when Emmi coughed at the dinner table and that she had difficulties with swallowing. The result of this discussion was that Emmi started to sit off to the side and sometimes even to eat in the nursing home's kitchen. For practical reasons, it was not possible for Emmi to eat at a different time to the other residents. The nurses cannot afford to spend any more time over meals than they already do as there are not enough staff. The other residents continue to say that they are disgusted by Emmi.\n\nEmmi's doctor and the nursing home staff are considering using a new artificial and medically assisted type of food provision for Emmi. However, Emmi makes it clear to the nurses that she will refuse any and every form of artificial food and fluid administration.",

    "case": "What is special about old age?\n\nGuy Widdershoven introduced the idea of ethics as concerning the meaningfulness of relationships, and he used the Emanuels schema for analysing the moral dimension of different types of patient doctor relationship. Ultimately, he argued that the deliberative model is the best approach because it respects and enhances meaningfulness and meaning-making in some way, i.e. it allows and enables both patients and physicians to engage in the joint process of making sense.\n\nWith that last question, we return to the essence of our case. What should the nurses do with Emmi? Should they introduce artificial food and fluid administration or not? The answer to this question has to be the result of an interdisciplinary consultation including all those involved in the case. In our opinion, this case requires an individualized approach. Maximum attention should be given to the development of a relationship based on trust between the nurses and Emmi. They have to search together for the most humanly possible outcome which can be realized in this (not ideal) situation. The autonomy of Emmi should be promoted by maintaining and supporting the natural feeding process. To realize this ethical option in the case of Emmi, a high level of competency, creativity and devotion will be required.\n\nYet it is not necessarily the case that there is a distinct stage of life which we might call old age. Socially constructed understandings of old age can be challenged, particularly when, in much of the developed world at least, populations not only live but also remain active for longer - a trend which is neatly captured by older and bolder campaigns. However, we might still agree that there are features of life as it comes to its end which are distinctive. It seems likely that many of us as we reach the later years of our lives will reflect more on the nature of our decline and death than we did when we were younger and will perhaps begin to reflect increasingly on the nature of our lives as a whole.\n\nIt remains the case, however, that we are reluctant to talk about these things publicly. The US bioethicist Daniel Callahan, in his book Setting Limits (1987), argues that there is an urgent need for a public discussion of the values and distinctive characteristics of old age. He suggests that modern patient-centred medicine (the bioethics approach described by Widdershoven earlier) has tended to undermine the meaninglessness of old age by its emphasis on individualism and life-extending treatments. He suggests that the emphasis on individual rights and life-extension may detract from recognizing the particular moral and social meanings of reaching life's end.",

    "case": "The case of Sean\nSean is 15 years old. He lives at home with his parents and a sister who is 12. His father is a senior civil servant and his mother is a healthcare professional. They live in a small town in an affluent part of Ireland.\nWhen Sean's father first made contact with the therapist he said that he was looking for help for his son because the boy seemed to have a chip on his shoulder and was always in trouble. He said that he had persuaded Sean to see someone. They arrived together for the first session but Sean was seen on his own.\nSean was anxious and uncomfortable, uncertain why he was there. He felt that he was being blamed for the tension that existed between his parents. It seemed that there had always been conflict between father and son; when Sean was younger he was frequently beaten for what he saw as minor misdemeanours. He said that his father would hit first and possibly listen later. Sean felt that he could not rely on his mother to protect him from his father's anger. Sean had harboured fantasies for at least the last six years of getting his own back by beating his father. He also constantly talked about wanting to be away from home.\nSean says that he has always felt that he is not good enough, that he has not achieved enough and is a disappointment to his parents. The transition from junior to senior school was a difficult one for Sean. In the senior school he associated with the boys in his class who smoked and took time off school. He felt that one teacher in particular was against him, because he constantly reprimanded and punished Sean for being cheeky. Two years ago there was a disagreement between Sean and the teacher during which Sean hit the teacher. Sean was then expelled from school.\nHis parents were very angry with him and immediately sent him away to boarding school. Sean was very distressed and refused to go but he was forcibly taken to the school and left there. In the first few weeks he was bullied by the other boys and ran away. He was apprehended by the police and returned to school where he continued to be subjected to frequent beatings. A little later he ran away again and managed to avoid being found by hiding in a derelict building. He then returned home, where he was surprised by his parents acceptance that he did not want to return to the boarding school. Instead he was to attend as a day boy at a school nearby. Since then there had been no further conflict at the school he does attend.\nDisagreements continue at home, however. Sean feels that his parents, his father in particular, are constantly spying on him. He is never allowed to be in the house on his own. Sometimes he is allowed to go out with his friends, but sometimes this is refused. He has continued to get into fights with other youths in the town and on one recent occasion was seriously assaulted. He feels bitter that his father did not find the youth and beat him up. He is nervous when he goes into town and recently has started to drink very large amounts of alcohol. This has caused more arguments at home, but Sean feels that his father has been hypocritical because he also drinks heavily on occasion.\nSean is confused about why he should need to see a therapist. He feels that his father is the cause of all his problems and is trying to offload the blame onto him. Sean's father wants his son to settle down to work at school so that he can go to university. He feels frustrated and angry about his son's behaviour and hopes that a few sessions with the therapist will sort him out.",

    "case": "The case of Emilia\n\nEmilia, aged four, had been brought to a child psychiatrist because she had regressed in her behaviour and speech. Since her parents separated, on the grounds of the husband s alleged physical violence against his wife, Emilia had been living with her mother. However, she had seen her father on regular access visits.\n\nClinical examination of Emilia revealed high risks of psychopathological disorders, but no current identifiable pathology. Emilia s mother was concerned that the child s condition was worsening, and she attributed the child s problems to stress induced by the fear of her violent father. She asked the psychiatrist to support her application for a court order discontinuing the father s access visits. The psychiatrist refused, stating that It is part of the therapy to side with the child rather than with either parent.\n\nAfter an initial period during which Emilia regularly attended therapy sessions, with reasonably good results, the mother renewed her request to the psychiatrist for an expert opinion to back up her court application. The psychiatrist again refused. There was no overt confrontation, but the mother stopped taking Emilia to the therapy sessions.\n\nThe mother has the ultimate power to withhold consent to treatment on Emilia s behalf, but her power may seem rather hollow to her because it is only negative. It does not extend to success in persuading the psychiatrist to give expert testimony against the access visits, which she views as the step most likely to advance Emilia s best interests.\n\nThe psychiatrist thought that therapy was progressing favourably, and that the child s best interests lay in continuing it. He viewed the mother s refusal to continue therapy for Emilia as motivated by annoyance at her failure to win him over to her side in the court case, not by concern for Emilia s best interests.",

Both he and his family were well known to the staff there and enjoyed a good relationship with them. In recent months, however, the boy s condition had become very serious. He had developed extensive varices of the oesophagus which brought with them an accompanying risk of serious bleeding which would put the boy s life in danger. When the doctor informed the family that the seriousness of the boy s condition might require a blood transfusion in order to save his life, both the boy and his family refused to consider such an option because of their faith. For the whole family were devout and active Jehovah s Witnesses.\n\nThe paediatricians involved in the case disagreed about how they ought to proceed and asked a child psychiatrist to assess the child s competence to make the decision to refuse treatment. One possible option which was considered was to make an application for a court order to take custody of the boy away from his parents in order to allow the transfusion to take place. The psychiatrist reported that the boy was intelligent and sensitive, that he was in no sense emotionally or socially disturbed and that he had a good relationship with his parents. He also had a clear understanding of his illness and of the treatment and was conscious of the consequences of his decisions to refuse a blood transfusion. He stuck to his decision and said that his parents had exerted no pressure on him. He simply wanted to live according to the principles of his faith.\n\nAfter interviewing the parents as well, it seemed clear that they cared very much for their son and indeed for all of their children. On the whole they were rational about the decision to refuse the transfusion and appeared, as the boy himself had said, not to have put any explicit pressure on the boy to refuse this particular form of treatment.",

    "case": "Case study: the Montjoie a air\nUntil the early 1980s most professionals working with abused children in France would invoke the Law of Silence. In this era of silence abuses of discretion abounded. It was di cult to evaluate the number of ill-treated children, or even of fatal cases of abuse. The percentage of abuse cases reported to the judicial authorities was very low. Yet the law did make it plain that doctors were to be released from their normal professional duty of con dentiality when, in the course of their work, they came to know of abuse and neglect of children under the age of 15.\n\nIn the early 1980s, however, a public campaign was organized around the slogan, 50 000 children are abused every year; speaking out is the rst step. Interministerial circulars of 1983 and 1985 informed practitioners of their responsibilities and speci ed procedures for hospital admission in cases of suspected abuse. This was followed up by legislation on the prevention of child abuse, in May 1989. But di culties about con dentiality remained. There was a basic discrepancy between an article of the criminal code which respected professional con dentiality and another article which allowed the criminal prosecution of anyone who having knowledge about abuse of a child under the age of 15, does not report the case to the administrative or judicial authorities. While it was clear that the doctor may report the case of an abused child without fear of criminal proceedings for breach of con dentiality, it was less clear whether he or she had an active responsibility to report cases of abuse encountered in the line of professional practice. Doctors were free to report abuse, but were they obliged to do so?\n\nIn December 1992 these dilemmas came to a head in the Montjoie a air. Damien, aged seven, and Mickael, aged 18, had been placed together in a foster family, but Damien s foster parents informed Mickael s educational psychologist that Damien had complained of being abused by Mickael. The psychiatrist on the team, Dr Bernard Chouraqui, was informed two days later that the psychologist wished to separate the two boys immediately, sending Mickael to another foster family. After discussion the team decided to wait 10 days before informing the judicial authorities so as to allow constructive therapy for Mickael, who was thought to be on the verge of a breakdown, which would be worsened by the threat of prosecution. The clinical team felt that he needed to be prepared to face the judicial consequences of his act.\n\nThe juvenile court was duly informed two weeks after the abuse had rst been reported. In January 1993 the investigating judge charged the educational psychologist and the social worker on the team with not having reported the abuse. On the same day the psychiatrist, Dr Chouraqui, appeared before the juvenile court of his own free will to explain the situation. He was immediately charged with the same o ence and imprisoned, together with the educational psychologist. Dr Chouraqui was not released to await trial for another two weeks; at his trial 10 months later, however, he was acquitted.",

The children lived with their mothers, each of whom refused to consent to their daughters receiving a range of vaccinations, including the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab. The girls mothers were opposed to vaccination because they felt that it posed unacceptable risks indeed, there had, at the time, been much media coverage of research which suggested an association between receiving the vaccine and developing autism and bowel problems (Wakefield et al., 1998).\n\nThe girls fathers were, however, in favour of them being immunized, because they felt that this was in the children s best interests. The fathers approached the courts for permission for the injections to be given and (although there were some differences in their situations) the two cases were considered together.\n\nMr Justice Sumner, in the High Court, basically agreed with the girls fathers: he ruled that it would be in each child s best interests to receive a range of vaccinations. He did recognize that the mothers (and their daughters) were owed the right to respect for their private and family life, but he further noted how these rights were qualified by the need to protect the health of the children. He also thought that, in time, the mothers would be able to come to terms with his decision, despite any initial upset they might feel.\n\nThe mothers decided to appeal to the Court of Appeal, but here too their case failed. This court ruled that the trial judge had been guided by the right considerations, since he had determined the best interests of the children by considering both the medical evidence and other factors relevant to the welfare of the children. However, the appeal judges conceded that Mr Justice Sumner had been particularly thorough in his consideration of the medical evidence, but they felt that this was entirely appropriate given the crucial importance of this evidence. Like the trial judge before them, the appeal judges felt that the balance tipped considerably in favour of the combined MMR vaccination and away from the unreliable evidence presented by the mothers legal team which was, said Lord Justice Sedley, junk science.",

(His mother had previously died of the disease.) Bone was taken from his right bula in an attempt to strengthen the left tibia, but after 15 months in plaster, his lower left leg had to be amputated. His right leg was weakened by the surgery, and he then underwent two attempts at osteotomy to treat a valgus right foot (one that rolls over). Now he is undergoing limb lengthening of the right bula. As he describes it, I m going to have a bone graft in my right leg. Take a little bit from here (he touches his hip) and put it here (he touches his ankle) to x it. And get a pin, just put it in and stitch it, then they wait till they heal it. He smiles and jokes about the forthcoming procedure: Then I ll get a wheel-chair be lazy all the time, I like that, better than crutches.\n\nDanny s parents are less sanguine: they have just learned that another large tumour has to be removed from his left leg stump. They feel that they have little choice but to consent to a further amputation if that proves necessary during the additional surgery, which will be done at the same time as the limb lengthening. They have not told Danny that his entire leg may have to be amputated. He knows about the new tumour, and has said I don t mind them taking the tumour, but I don t want them taking any more of my leg away . Danny s father says, You feel that everyone is doing what they believe to be in his best interest, but they are tending to work a little bit blind . Danny showed a great deal of cognitive maturity in the rst part of his story: he has clearly grown up early, in the face of long familiarity with his illness. In the second part he may actually seem less mature insofar as he is adamantly unwilling even to consider the additional surgery; is this his pain and fear speaking? Danny s stepmother explained to the boy that this will give greater leverage to the prosthesis, but Danny said adamantly, I don t want them doing that! . He would not explain why; he looked tired and depressed now, with dark circles under his eyes and little of his former chirpy manner. The surgeon gave the family three months to think about it, though he hinted that It would be interesting to see how the leg responds . Danny s stepmother was sceptical about the surgeon s motive: Is he really thinking about what s for Danny s bene t, or is he just curious? Danny s father replied, He genuinely felt that there was some advantage to Danny . But Danny s stepmother argued, He s going to senior school soon, he doesn t want another six months in a wheelchair . This is an important factor which does not appear on Pearce s otherwise very complete checklist (unless it can be included under item 4, views of signi cant others).\n\nACTIVITY: Stop at this point in the story and complete your checklist in relation to the limb lengthening of Danny s right bula and possible left leg amputation. Has a meaningful consent been obtained? Has the child s voice been heard? What about the parents position?\n\nIn the event it proved possible to save the remaining left leg, and the right leg grew well, although Danny su ered a great deal of pain from the limb lengthening procedure. Now the surgeons want to lengthen the small stump below Danny s left knee.

    "case": "The case of Mr K ‘\nMr K was a 95-year-old patient in a long-stay ward at Park Prewett Hospital, Basingstoke, North and Mid-Hampshire Health Authority (UK). Like many other hospitals, Park Prewett was under pressure to close long-stay wards and free up resources. Legislative changes meant that there was conflict between health authorities and social services departments over who should foot the bill for long-term care of the elderly. It was in both parties’ interests, however, to transfer the responsibility to families, who were expected to pay privately for the care of their elderly members.\n\nAt a meeting behind closed doors, the health authority decided to bring forward the date for closing Mr K s ward by 21 months. Although the consultant in charge of Mr K s care had deemed him unfit to be moved, the authority brought in an outside psychiatrist while the consultant was on leave. The psychiatrist conditionally approved the transfer. Along with 23 other elderly patients, Mr K was discharged to a private nursing home on the very day of the decision. Seventeen days later he died. Four other elderly patients also died within three weeks of discharge from the hospital.\n\nMr K s son-in-law brought a complaint against the health authority to the Health Service Commissioner, an independent authority established by the Health Commissioners Act 1993, who has powers to investigate complaints which cannot otherwise be settled in a court of law. The Commissioner condemned the health authority for acting undemocratically. He stated that their decision fell far short of the standards of accountability which a public body should display. Although the health authority had originally claimed that the meeting was informal and therefore private, North and Mid-Hampshire officials now acknowledged that the only sense in which it was informal was that it was not held in public.\n\nThe Commissioner declared that his decision should serve as a grim warning to any health authority or hospital trust planning to transfer long-term patients to the private sector. He also expressed considerable doubt that doctors consent to the patients discharge had been obtained let alone that of patients and their families.",

    "case": "The case of Baby Ryan\nRyan Nguyen was born 6 weeks prematurely, asphyxiated, and with only a weak heartbeat. His clinicians also diagnosed brain damage following seizures, an intestinal blockage, and renal failure which meant that his kidneys failed to clear toxins, although they produced urine. Initially, Ryan was sustained through intravenous feeding and dialysis, but his clinicians doubted that he could be kept alive in this fashion until he was old enough for a kidney transplant, at about 2 years. They wanted to end treatment on the grounds of futility: it was argued that long-term dialysis would not only be inappropriate but would be immoral, since it would prolong Ryan's suffering with no chance of improvement.\nRyan's parents refused to accept withdrawal of treatment, despite the hospital's view that imposing virtually futile treatment would be inhumane. The Nguyens sought a second opinion from a neonatologist at another hospital, but that, too, was unfavourable. Finally, they obtained an emergency court order, directing the hospital to take whatever steps were necessary to maintain Ryan's life, including dialysis. The publicity surrounding the case attracted another hospital's attention, and this third hospital accepted Ryan for transfer. Three days later, surgeons there operated to clear Ryan's blocked intestines. He was shortly able to take nutrition by mouth, and at 3 months he was sent home, not having needed any further dialysis. At 1 year he appeared to be developing normally for his age, free of any permanent neurological deficit; his most recent CAT scan shows no structural problems.",

    "case": "Mr Bowen brought a legal action to compel the Health Authority to fund Jaymee s treatment with the experimental procedure. His chances of success looked poor, despite a massive outpouring of public sympathy and extensive media coverage. Normally, English courts are reluctant to intervene in such matters unless it can be shown that the decision was taken in bad faith or was patently unreasonable. Clearly, there are limitations on patient choice, however, when there simply are insu cient resources. In the example about resource allocation, no court had actually – – done so. Although in a 1987 case (R. v. Secretary of State for Social Services, ex parte Walker) the Court of Appeal stated that courts could strike down decisions about resource allocation, however Mr Bowen succeeded, at least at rst. In the High Court the Health Authority s decision was quashed, and their powers to refuse treatment on grounds of resource shortage were severely limited. The Health Authority was ordered to reconsider its decision and to spell out its reasoning more clearly, allowing the father a chance to show that the decision had, in fact, been unreasonable. The burden was put on the Health Authority: its duty to recognize Jaymee s fundamental right to life required it to show compelling reasons why other patients should implicitly have priority over her. However, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision. Whether or not a treatment was life-saving, the Appeal Court held, had no bearing on the general principle that courts could not intervene to determine the merits of the dispute. Courts should not be drawn into resource allocation decisions. Nor should the Health Authority be forced to show where it planned to spend the money that would notionally be saved by not treating Jaymee. The Appeal Court s reasoning was based not primarily on resource shortage, however, but on the weight of medical evidence, suggesting that it was not in Jaymee s best interests to undergo the experimental procedure. So e cacy of treatment clearly is a proper legal consideration. In the end, a private benefactor came forward, offering to fund Jaymee s experimental treatment. She appeared at rst to be doing well after the procedure, but worsened after a few months and died. After her death, Mr Bowen reiterated his satisfaction that everything possible had been done, despite the tragic outcome.\n\nThe Case of Child B\n\nChild B (later publicly identi ed as Jaymee Bowen), aged 10, was acutely ill with leukaemia (R v Cambridge Health Authority, ex p. B [1995] 1 FLR 1055). A bone-marrow transplant had proved unsuccessful. Now both her own doctor and oncologists from London s Royal Marsden Hospital believed she had only a few weeks to live, with further treatment being futile. Although Jaymee s own views in favour of treatment – ffi were of uncertain validity she had not been told how ill she was her father refused to accept this decision. He located a professor at the Hammersmith Hospital who recommended a further course of chemotherapy followed by an experimental second bone-marrow transplant, which would have to be provided by Jaymee s younger sister. Primarily because the professor had acknowledged that this was experimental, non-standard therapy, and that the procedures were of no bene t, but that only an elite would bene t from them. And we thought that the refusal to fund IVF might be very unpopular whereas the committee had said that it was taking public opinion into account. In Section 3 we will look in more detail at the issue of public response to rationing IVF treatment.",

He was advised to have surgery but chose not to, as he explained in his book In the Face of Death:\n\nSurvival chances in bladder cancer are relatively good, especially if the surgery is combined with radiation treatment. How favourable the odds were was a matter of statistics about 50%. In response to my questions, [the urologist] says that sexual intercourse would no longer be possible since there could be no erection; but there was no other essential limitation biking, sports in moderate measure, even skiing. Patients who survived the critical first five years all grew accustomed to the curtailed life. When I explained that I would never consent to such an operation under any conditions, he said that he had great respect for such a decision but that I should really get as much information as possible from other doctors as well. Did I want to take the X-rays with me? I said no; the case seemed quite clear to me.\n\nPeter Noll died nearly a year after his diagnosis, during which he had lived alone and administered his own pain relief. However he had continued to write, to work and to meet his friends until the last few days of his life.\n\nIn his autobiographical book, which takes the form of a diary, Peter Noll records his thoughts from the moment of his being diagnosed with bladder cancer until immediately before his death. The relevance of this day-to-day description of the progression of an incurable disease for the discussion of the right to refuse treatment lies in the motives Peter Noll had for his refusal. In fact, the whole book can be seen to some extent as a long, written, argumentative meditation explaining his refusal, a refusal which might prima facie seem unreasonable.\n\nAs a part of his preparation for death Peter Noll planned his own funeral.",

She is spending six hours, three times a week on a dialysis machine and the e ects of this on her and her family are becoming increasingly hard for her and her family to bear. She has already had one kidney transplant, which her body rejected, and her doctors are unsure whether a second would work but are willing to try if they can nd a suitable donor. After some tests the paediatrician privately tells the father that he is compatible and therefore a suitable donor. It may seem inconceivable that a father would refuse to donate his kidney to his daughter under such circumstances. Yet he does refuse and justi es his decision both on the grounds that the success of the transplant is uncertain and also on the basis of his fears about the implications of the operation itself for him and his family. He is frightened and worried about what would happen to him and his other children if his remaining kidney were to fail. But he is ashamed to feel this way and cannot bear to refuse openly so he asks the paediatrician to tell the family that he is in fact not compatible. However, whilst having some sympathy, she says she cannot lie for him and, after a silence, the father says, OK then I ll do it. If they knew that I was compatible but wouldn t donate my kidney, it would wreck the family.",

His condition is deteriorating rapidly, and for the past four months he has lived in a nursing home. Now he is con fined to a wheelchair and cannot feed himself. His wife Susan comes to visit him every day, bringing a home-cooked evening meal. The nursing home s guidelines for good practice encourage relatives involvement, and Mr P does seem pleased to see Susan when she rst arrives. But although Mr P has a hot meal at lunch time in the nursing home, Susan thinks he also needs a proper meal in the evening, rather than the sandwiches and cakes provided at the home. Mr P appears to resist Susan s attempts to feed him, tossing and turning in his wheelchair. She in turn has taken to playing a little game: holding his nose, so that when he opens his mouth for air, she can spoon-feed him. This seems to make Mr P very agitated, and he is often hard to calm after Susan s visits.\n\nThe nursing home sta have asked Susan not to feed Mr P, but this has led to worsening relations. They feel that Mr P is clearly indicating that he does not want to be forcibly fed. Susan, very hurt by this comment, insists that she is handling Mr P in a playful but caring fashion, and that she has to do something about Mr P s weight loss, which she blames on inadequate nutrition in the home. If you can t even feed him properly, what else are you doing wrong? He s not getting any better, you know. The nursing sta themselves are divided, some feeling that Susan is trying to help, and others that she is in denial about her husband s impending death. The doctors at the nursing home, however, are unanimous. They see no reason to allow Susan to continue feeding Mr P, as it is contrary to his medical best interests and indeed risks asphyxiation. The manager of the home agrees with the doctors: this unnecessary trouble is upsetting the smooth running of the home, and should be stopped.",
