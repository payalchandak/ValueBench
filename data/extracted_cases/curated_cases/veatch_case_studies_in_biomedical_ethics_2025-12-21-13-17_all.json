    "case": "Case 1-1\nDisclosure of a Terminal Diagnosis\nRichard Dossey, a 68-year-old architect, was admitted to the oncology service after having an emergency operation in another state while there on vacation. According to Mr. Dossey, the surgeon at the hospital told him that he had gastric cancer but assured him that “a few cycles of chemotherapy should successfully treat the cancer.” When he was stable enough to travel, arrangements were made at the hospital where the operation took place to have Mr. Dossey admitted to a hospital in his home town. Mr. Dossey then flew home on a private jet accompanied by his wife.\n\nSashi Jajoura, MD, the oncologist who was now attending Mr. Dossey, read the surgical report and was shocked to discover that there were significant lymph node metastases. She knew that despite attempts to improve quality of care, survival rates for gastric cancer remained poor—around 10% overall 5-year survival for patients with advanced disease, positive margins after resection, and advanced age. In essence, postoperative chemoradiotherapy might offer some additional time, but it was unlikely that any therapy would result in a cure.\n\nClearly, the information in the pathology report in Mr. Dossey’s clinical records from the hospital where he underwent the operation did not mesh with his reported understanding of his prognosis. Meanwhile, as Dr. Jajoura determined the best course of palliative treatment for Mr. Dossey, he developed acute renal failure. A sonogram revealed bilateral hydronephrosis, probably caused by the primary tumor that had extended to the ureters. During this crisis, Dr. Jajoura informed Mr. Dossey that he was acutely ill as a result of kidney failure. She also informed him that the probable reason for his kidney failure was the cancer.\n\nDr. Jajoura then discussed the plan of treatment with Mr. Dossey, proposing that catheters be placed into the ureters through small bilateral incisions and a presurgical computed tomography (CT) scan. She explained that, postoperatively, he would be a candidate for chemoradiotherapy. Also, because Mr. Dossey’s creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were rising quickly, she asked him if he had prepared an advance directive and if he had specifically thought about a do-not-resuscitate order should his heart stop beating or if he should stop breathing.\n\nThough stunned, Mr. Dossey said he would like to talk to his wife, his adult son, and the pastor at his church about his prognosis and the proposed treatment. He then angrily burst out: “That surgeon lied to me!”\n\nThe next day, Mr. Dossey told the clinical nurse specialist and the staff nurses that he wanted to go home that day without treatment and without any more diagnostic tests, saying, “I know the doctors aren't going to agree with me, but I want to leave anyway.” When the nurses asked his wife and son about Mr. Dossey’s decision, both responded in unison, “He has always made his own decisions. We support him in this decision.” Dr. Jajoura asked Mr. Dossey to consent to the CT scan to determine the extent of the cancer, but he refused and stood by his request to be discharged.°",

    "case": "». Case 2-]\nExercise, Diet, or Drugs to Control Cholesterol\nJake Mendiola knew he had a problem. He was 37 years old. At 5/10” and\n230 pounds, he was heavier than his doctor liked. His sedentary lifestyle, as\nan information technology specialist at a major accounting firm, meant he\ndid not get the exercise that his wife and his physician thought he should.\nHis physical exams over the past several years showed a nagging increase\nin total cholesterol levels (237 mg/dl); the low-density lipoprotein (LDL; “bad”)\nwas too high, and the good high-density lipoprotein (HDL) was too low. His\nphysician had twice recommended exercise at least three days a week and\nsome dietary modification to get the cholesterol lower. Mr. Mendiola went\npart way. He cut down on eggs for breakfast. He intentionally signed up for\nthe cheaper parking lot at work so he would be forced to walk about three\nblocks to his office. He knew, however, that this was not exactly what his\nphysician had in mind.\nNow at a routine trip to his HMO (health maintenance organization), his\ndoctor nagged him again about diet and exercise. The physician continued\nto worry about the cholesterol, pointing out that the treatment protocol at the\nHMO indicated that diet and exercise should bring the cholesterol into line.\nIf not, Mr. Mendiola was going to have to go on one of the new cholesterol-\nlowering medications called “statins.”\nThe effect on Mr. Mendiola was not what ibe physician had oepeced.\nA question occurred to Mr. Mendiola. He said to himself, “Do you mean I could\nget the same cholesterol reduction by simply taking the pill and still eat\nwhat I have been eating and not sign up for the plan at the local gym?”\nMr. Mendiola considered his options: (1) ask the doctor to put him on a statin\ndrug right now, (2) intentionally avoid the diet and exercise regimen until his\nnext physical exam when the physician would discover that his cholesterol\nwas still too high and, on his own, write the prescription for the statin drug, or\n(3) attempt to follow more faithfully the physician's recommendation about\ndiet and exercise to see if the cholesterol problem will be taken care of. Of\ncourse, there was a fourth option—take his chances and continue with a high-\ncholesterol level, unmedicated and uncontrolled by either diet or exercise.\n\nCase 2-2\nTreating Breast Cancer: Finding the Value Judgments\nIt seemed to May Bachman that she had never been confronted with so\nmany important decisions in such a short time frame in her life. Just two\nshort weeks ago, when she went in for annual mammography, she learned\nthat the microcalcifications in her right breast (the radiologist had been\nmonitoring) had changed in their appearance from the last year’s film.\nMs. Bachman had dense breast tissue with numerous microcalcifications,\nso she knew that annual mammography was in order. She had been told by\nher radiologist that the calcifications could be a sign of ductal carcinoma\nin situ (DCIS). It was still a shock to hear that the changes in the mammog-\nraphy films required more diagnostic tests; a breast biopsy was needed to\nascertain the actual pathology.\nThe results from the core needle biopsy showed that the lesion was\ninvasive cancer. There was no palpable mass in the breast, but only further\noperation would determine the size of the tumor and whether it had in-\nvaded the lymph nodes. In a whirlwind of appointments, Ms. Bachman met\nwith a surgeon to learn about what options were available. If no lymph\nnodes are involved, breast conservation therapy (BCT), also called lumpec-\ntomy, was one option, as was a simple mastectomy (excision of the breast,\nnipple, areola, and most of the overlying skin). Ms. Bachman also met with\nan oncologist who said that further treatment decisions would be based\non the stage of the disease and her age. For example, if the tumor was\nsmall, from 2 to 5 cm, and had invaded the lymph nodes, then she would be\na candidate for chemotherapy. Moreover, whether the tumor was estrogen-\nreceptor positive or negative played a significant role in how aggressive\ntreatment should be.\nDepending on how many lymph nodes were involved, the oncologist\nmight recommend radiation therapy, noting that some studies suggested\nthat postmastectomy radiation therapy was indicated even for patients\nwith Tl-2 (tumor of 1-2 cm) breast cancer with 0-3 positive nodes. The\nchemotherapy had significant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fa-\ntigue, cognitive changes, alopecia, insomnia, and constipation. Another\nserious side effect was ovarian toxicity. Since Ms. Bachman was 87 years\nold and premenopausal, this was of concern to her. It was likely that chemo-\ntherapy would result in amenorrhea and premature menopause. The sur-\ngeon and oncologist stated that if the cancer was in an early stage, they\nwould recommend BCT and aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for\nthe best survival outcomes. Ms. Bachman knew, from looking at reputable\nsites on the Internet, that there was controversy over what was the best\ncourse of action. She felt pressured by the surgeon to choose BCT even\nthough she thought she would feel safer with a more radical removal of\nbreast tissue, but she was not sure. She had so little time to weigh the bene-\nfits and risks of all the different treatment options that were presented to\nher, she felt overwhelmed.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n| Choose one of the treatment options presented to Ms. Bachman and high-\nlight the underlying values from the health professional’s and patients\nperspectives.\n.. What differences exist between the values of the health professional and\npatient?\nHow might the values identified impact communication and decisions?\n\nCase 2-3\nInfertility Treatment: God's Will?\nBette Gabriele had struggled with obesity most of her adult life. She lost\nand gained 100 pounds at least twice. When she finally found a healthy\ncombination of diet and exercise, she was almost 30. A year later she met\nGino, the man she would marry. For the past six years the Garbrieles have\ntried to conceive. Both were fully evaluated at an infertility center. Test re-\nsults indicated that the Gabrieles have unexplained infertility, although\nBette’s age and weight gain since her marriage were risk factors in the de-\nvelopment of infertility.\nAs a practicing Catholic, Ms. Gabriele spoke to her priest, who said\nthere were no church objections to drugs to induce ovarian hyperstimulation\n(OH) or timed intercourse. In vitro fertilization (IVF) and intrauterine insemi-\nnation (IUI) were not permitted. If any treatment resulted in multiple preg-\nnancies, reduction of the number of embryos, a common recommendation,\nwould be forbidden as it would be seen as abortion according to Church\nteaching.\nMs. Gabriele began OH treatment but did not become pregnant during\nher first cycle. She was discouraged because of her efforts and of the signifi-\ncant expense. A friend who was going through the same treatment decided\nto terminate further treatment after IVF failure. She told Ms. Gabriele, “You\njust have to accept the reality that technology doesn’t work all the time.”\nWith her husband's encouragement, Ms. Gabriele decided to continue\ntreatment. The next month, hope loomed on the horizon. Studies showed\nthere were multiple mature follicles indicating a good chance of a multife-\ntal pregnancy, thus increasing the risks to the fetuses and herself if she\ncarried all of the babies to delivery.\nShe felt like time was running out, so she opted to proceed, saying to\nherself that whatever happened was God's will.\n\nBaby Doe: Legal and Moral Options\nOn April 9, 1982, a baby was born in Bloomington, Indiana, who would\neventually be referred to as “Baby Doe.”* He had an esophageal atresia\n(a blockage of the tube that carries food to the stomach) and an associated\ntracheo-esophageal fistula (an opening between the esophagus and the\ntrachea that would permit food to pass into the lungs rather than the stom-\nach). He also had a genetic condition known as Down syndrome. The Down\nsyndrome would leave the boy with some undetermined level of mental —\nretardation even if his anatomical problems were corrected, but, according\nto published reports, the child would have a high probability of surviving,\nalbeit with the Down syndrome, if his only medical problems were the sur-\ngically correctable fistula and atresia.\nThe attending obstetrician, Walter Owens, informed the parents that,\neven with the operation, the child would still not be normal. He would\n“have all the problems that even the best of them have.” He added that\n“some of these children ... are mere blobs” (cited in U.S. Commission on\nCivil Rights, p. 22).\nOn the basis of this information, the parents decided not to permit op-\neration to correct the fistula. The parents were trained as teachers and had\nexperience teaching handicapped and retarded children. They had two\nother children without Down syndrome.\nSome reports indicated that the baby also had a cardiac septal defect,\na serious malformation of the heart that would require operative repair.\nThat possibility might explain why some claims were made that the child\nhad only a 50-50 chance of survival even with operation.°®\nWhen nurses protested the decision of the parents not to treat, the hospi-\ntal sought judicial intervention. In the lower court, Judge John G. Baker\nsupported the parental decision, finding that the parents, after being fully\ninformed, “have the right to choose a medically recommended course of\ntreatment for their child in the present circumstances.” The Indiana Supreme\nCourt refused to get involved, thus upholding the lower court's decision.\nThose opposing the parents sought appeal to U.S. Supreme Court, but\nthat appeal was made moot by death of the baby on April 15. Two weeks\nlater, President Reagan asked the Attorney General and Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to become involved, noting that federal\nlaw prohibits discrimination against the handicapped. This led to the issu-\ning of a notice that it was illegal to discriminate against infants solely on\nthe basis of handicap. While this notice was rejected by the courts, eventu-\nally a law was passed classifying withholding of life support in cases such\nas this as child abuse.",

He had beaten her over the head with a hammer and stabbed her in\nthe chest with a knife. He conspired in the murder with his cousin, Rick\nOrtega, who had been in a homosexual relationship with another man who\nwas concurrently dating Winchell. Ortega’s jealousy was purportedly the\nmotive for the attack on Winchell.\nFor twenty-five years the conviction proceeded through the California\ncourts until the much-postponed execution day of February 21, 2006, arrived.\nMr. Morales was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. at San Quentin. U.S.\nDistrict Judge Jeremy Fogel had ordered that, in order to avoid cruelty if the\ndrugs to be used in the execution did not do their job properly, the prison\nhad to have a medical professional present in the death chamber. Two anes-\nthesiologists, whose identity has never been made public, were engaged\nfor this purpose, but, under pressure from medical professional organiza-\ntions, they withdrew two hours before the scheduled execution. The execution\nwas indefinitely postponed. Morales expressed relief. Terri Winchell’s mother\ndescribed the news as “a blow in the stomach.”\nThose critical of the participation of the physicians in the execution cite\nthe AMA's Code of Medical Ethics, which states, “A physician, as a member\nof a profession dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so,\nshould not be a participant in a legally authorized execution.”!® According\nto the AMA, this precludes selecting injection sites, starting IV lines, and\nprescribing, preparing, administering, or supervising injection of lethal\ndrugs. For the AMA, this does not extend to testifying about medical history,\ndiagnosis, or mental state; certifying death; witnessing an execution in a\ntotally nonmedical capacity; or relieving the acute suffering of a condemned\nprisoner awaiting execution.\nDefenders of physician participation claim that physicians, as licensed\nmedical professionals, should be involved in order to assure that the state's\ncommitment to avoiding unnecessarily cruel punishment is satisfied.\nIn California, following the postponement of the execution, competing\nbills were introduced into the legisiature by physicians who were members of\nthe California legislature. Senator Sam Aenestad, a general anesthesiologist,\nintroduced legislation to protect physicians who participate in executions\nfrom punishment or professional discipline. Meanwhile, Assemblymen Alan\nNakanishi, an eye surgeon, and a colleague introduced a bill sponsored by\nthe California Medical Association prohibiting physician participation. At\nissue is not only the general ethics of capital punishment but also the ques-\ntion of whether participation of physicians is compatible with their role as\nhealers.”",

Case 3-4\nThe Eager Research Subject: Justifying External Moral Standards\nDr. Laura Bollinger was a 62-year-old former college professor of biology\nwho had taken early retirement when she developed macular degeneration\nthat produced blindness. Over the years in which her sight was deteriorat-\ning, she began researching the causes and potential therapies for blind-\ness. She had been a patient in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH)\nAge-Related Eye Disease Study and had developed a friendship with NIH\nscientists at the National Eye Institute. In particular, she came to know and\nbecame friends with Dr. Anton Hakola, one of the leading researchers in\nthe vision restoration lab.\nFrom that friendship, she learned of some avant-garde research that\nwas arousing the interest of the research ophthalmology community. With\nthe development of microcircuity electronics, some scientists believed that\neventually the technology would be developed that could produce an artifi-\ncal eye. In effect, it would be a miniature camera that converted images into\nelectrical impulses that could be fed directly into the occipital lobe of the\nbrain, thus bypassing a damaged eye. At the point Dr. Bollinger heard about\nthese ideas, the research was in its earliest stages. Very few animal studies\nhad been completed. She knew that eventually researchers would want to\nattempt the development of this technology in humans, who could give much\nmore precise feedback on the placing of the electrodes into the brain.\nAfter extensive research on the safety and potential effectiveness of\nthis line of research, Dr. Bollinger gradually came to the conclusion that\nshe would be the ideal research subject. She was blind, had a deep interest\nin developing such technology, and had the scientific capacity to under-\nstand the risks and to cooperate with the investigators. She also had large\namounts of time available. She offered her services to Dr. Hakola.\nHesitant at first, he came to believe that Dr. Bollinger understood ex-\nactly what she was doing and could, in fact, be a significant contributor to\nthe research. She understood that the research would involve cutting a\nhalf-dollar-sized hole in her skull, through which researchers could pass\nelectrodes. Similar work had been done over the years to map the location\nof motor and sensory areas of the brain, but these experiments were often\ndone on patients who needed to have their skulls opened for some thera-\npeutic purpose. This project would involve a much larger hole, and it would\nbe undertaken solely for research purposes.\nA protocol was developed and presented to an institutional review\nboard (IRB), a hospital board responsible for reviewing research to assure\nthat subjects are protected. Several members of that board questioned the\nresearch on the grounds that it posed risks that were too great and that the\nresearch must first be developed in lower animal species before being\ntried in humans. After extensive debate, the IRB refused to approve the pro-\nposal until further animal studies were completed. These could take two to\nthree years.\nDr. Bollinger was disturbed, indeed annoyed, at the IRB decision. She\nunderstood that she was very unlikely to benefit from the study. Surely the\nfirst results would produce nothing more than a crude visual image of light\nand dark patterns, and that could take many years. She was unlikely to live\nlong enough for the technology to be perfected. On the other hand, she felt\na close identification with the community of the visually impaired and felt\nshe had a moral right to make her unique contribution, as long as scientists\nwere willing to accept her as a research subject. She was willing to sign\nany legal release from liability that seemed necessary. If Dr. Bollinger and\nDr. Hakola both find this research at this time to be moral and the informed\nconsent is impeccable, are there moral standards to which the IRB can\nappeal that would justify delaying the research?",

    "case": "» Case 3-5\nAbortion in a Catholic Hospital\nNatasha Jones was a 34-year-old, single, African American woman preg-\nnant for the fourth time. She was being seen in the prenatal clinic at the\ncommunity's only tertiary care Catholic hospital because she had a history\nof three previous episodes of ruptured uterus that had resulted in the\ndeaths of her previous fetuses. She was currently in her twentieth week of\npregnancy. She was a member of a local Baptist church.\nDr. Lakisha Nevitt, her attending physician, was very concerned be-\ncause ultrasound revealed that a portion of Ms. Jones's uterine wall was no\nmore than a millimeter in thickness. She was convinced it would soon rup-\nture, ending the life of the fetus and posing a serious risk to Ms. Jones's life.\nIt was her opinion that, with virtual certainty, the uterus would rupture\nbefore the fetus could reach full term.\nDr. Nevitt knew that, since the hospital had a Roman Catholic affilia-\ntion, abortion could not be performed there. Even though Dr. Nevitt was\nherself not Catholic, she accepted this stance when she went to work at this\nhospital. Even if an exception could be made in this case to preserve the\nlife of the mother, no one in the hospital's obstetrics department had enough\nexperience with abortion to perform one safely. The real issue was whether\nthey should advise Ms. Jones of the seriousness of her situation and recom-\nmend that she be transferred to City Hospital, which was only a mile away\nand had a staff with considerable experience with abortion.\nDr. Nevitt asked for a hospital ethics committee meeting to try to sort\nout the options. There was a quick consensus among the medical people on\nthe committee that this was a life-threatening situation and that Ms. Jones's\nuterus would almost certainly rupture well before a full-term birth. The\nethics committee included two Catholic chaplains, both of whom empha-\nsized that since they were in a Catholic institution, they must begin with\nthe presumption that all life, including fetal life, is sacred and cannot be\nintentionally terminated. The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic\nHealth Care Services was cited, which states categorically, “Abortion (that\nis, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the\ndirectly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted.”!°\nOne of the committee members raised the question of whether an ex-\nception can be made for preserving the life of the mother. He pointed out\n58 | Part 1 Ethics and Values in Medical Cases\n\nthat it seems tragic to condone the death of both mother and fetus when at\nleast the mother could be saved. Since this was an extremely rare case\nwhere there was virtual certainty that the mother could not survive the rup-\nture and that, if this occurred, the fetus would die as well, he urged making\nan exception by informing the woman that their committee recommend\nthat she be transferred to a secular hospital such as City Hospital.\nOne of the chaplains responded, pointing out that the prohibition was\nexceptionless. The only possibility would be to interpret the intervention as\nan “indirect” killing of the fetus, which would be acceptable for proportion-\nally good reasons. This, he indicated, was the reasoning used in cases in\nwhich a pregnant woman has cancer of the uterus. In such cases a hyster-\nectomy is permitted to remove the cancer even though the fetus would die\nin the process. He suggested that perhaps a hysterectomy could be accept-\nable in this case as well since the weakness in the uterine wall would pose\na threat to the woman not only in this pregnancy but in any future pregnan-\ncies as well. He acknowledged that this reasoning was controversial but\nthought it would justify a recommendation from the committee that the pa-\ntient be directed to the City Hospital. He noted that legally the hospital was\nnot required to have staff to perform abortions, but that they were required\nto inform the patient of treatment options—including transferring to an-\nother hospital that would offer abortion services.\nThe committee members recognized that, if this case had arisen in any\nother hospital without an institutional commitment opposing all direct\nabortions, a recommendation for terminating this pregnancy would be\nreached by easy consensus.\nThe dilemma here is how the moral stance of the sponsors of the hospi-\ntal should shape the way medicine is practiced in this institution.",

When he asked how she had so much energy, she told him,\n“I take those diet pills that you can get over the counter at any drugstore.\nSometimes I add phentermine_Iw chain cgeht on the Internet.” He asked\nher about the Sead of detection-of the drugs bb ecause the university\nwas.a— : vironment and they had agreed to this when entering\nmedical school. Sheila responded, \"I was worarboiut ethadt, b ut you would\nhave to take a bucket of this stuff to have it show up in your urine.” At the\nend of their conversation, Sheila had given him some of the phentermine to\ntry. Michael also bought some diet pills at his local pharmacy. He had not\nused either of them yet, but if there was ever a time he might need help in\nmaking it through the week, he reasoned, this was it.\nHe had never taken either of these drugs, so _he-was_not sure of the\neffect. He was a little concerned that they mightb e more potent than Sheila\nlet on because he noticed lately that she had gotten quite thin.a nd haggard\nlooking. She told him, “I am only sleeping about 3 hoursa night. I cannot\nwake up without these pills.” He> is not sure how much she is taking, though,\nand did not plan on taking more than a few pills a day to get him through\nthis week of studying. Without it he felt sure he would not do well on the\nexam; with the drugs he might do well. He thought he had little to lose and\nan entire career to gain.\nShould he take the pills even though he knows there could be some se-\nrious side effects? What if it is discovered that he has broken the \"drug-free\"\npolicy of the School of Medicine?",

    "case": "The Benefits and Harms of High-Risk Chemotherapy\nJoe Cavanaugh, a 58-year-old professor of economics, was diagnosed\nwith chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) several months ago. Though\nthis particular type of leukemia is somewhat less responsive to chemo-\ntherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh responded well to a course of chemotherapy\nthat he took orally shortly after his diagnosis. Dr. Cavanaugh’s last blood\ncount indicated that his white blood count was greatly reduced. During\nthe course of his chemotherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh had become close to\nHeather Eyberg, Pharm.D., the clinical pharmacist in the cancer treat-\nment center.\nAfter a follow-up visit with the oncologist, Dr. Cavanaugh stopped by\nDr. Eyberg’s office. Dr. Cavanaugh said, “The doctor has suggested several\npossibilities regarding my treatment. I trust you, and I would appreciate\nyour opinion on my options. The doctor said that now that I have finished\ntaking the oral chemotherapy, I could start interferon alpha or, if I want to\nbe “cured,” I should think about a stem cell transplant. The type of leuke-\nmia I have can rapidly change from this chronic phase into acute leukemia.\nIf that happens, it is unlikely that anything would help, and I would not\nhave long to live. The doctor wants me to think about a stem cell transplant.\nHe said I could remain in this holding pattern for years, but there is no\nway of knowing. Or I could have high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell\ntransplant. What do you think?”\nDr. Eyberg respects Dr. Cavanaugh and his capacity to understand the\nrisks and benefits involved in stem cell transplantation. She knows that al-\nlogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only therapy\nproven to cure CML. If Dr. Cavanaugh has a sibling that is a match and has\nthe HSCT within the first year of his diagnosis, he has a better five-year\nsurvival rate than those who undergo HSCT after the first year of diagnosis.\nSo time is of the essence. The two options presented to Dr. Cavanaugh are\nessentially: watch, wait, take the interferon alpha and hope that the disease\nnever progresses or take a chance on HSCT now. The risks of HSCT are sub-\nstantial. The possibility of infection and other complications is very high.\nIt is not inconceivable that Dr. Cavanaugh could die from the HSCT itself.\nSince Dr. Eyberg is part of the cancer treatment team, she is unsure of\nwhere her moral commitment should lie. Should she counsel Dr. Cavanaugh\nto choose the least harmful course of therapy? The conservative route would\nprobably be to watch and wait and take the interferon alpha. Yet, if the\ndisease progresses to acute leukemia, there is little anyone could do to\nhelp Dr. Cavanaugh. However, Dr. Cavanaugh could be in the percentage\nof patients who never progress to this fatal phase of the disease. Even if he\neventually did change to the fatal phase, Dr. Cavanaugh might have many\ngood years with his wife and children until then.\nDr. Eyberg could also counsel Dr. Cavanaugh to choose that option\nthat maximizes the benefit for him. It is hard in this situation to determine\nwhich course of action will do the most good in the long run. Clearly, HSCT\nholds greater risk in the short run but offers the potential for a cure of\nDr. Cavanaugh’s leukemia in the long run.\nFinally, Dr. Eyberg is troubled by the memory of another patient witha\nsimilar diagnosis who recently chose the option of HSCT and did not sur-\nvive the procedure. Given all of these considerations, Dr. Eyberg is not\nsure where to begin.",

He had been diagnosed with a primary tumor of the liver\nat the health maintenance organization (HMO) where he was a member.\nMr. Villanueva had been asymptomatic during the early stages of the tumor’s\ndevelopment. When he was diagnosed the tumor had grown to 5 cm in\ndiameter, which meant it had developed to the point that it was beginning\nto pose a serious risk of metastasis or, in other words, spreading throughout\nhis body. He was informed by his HMO hepatologist, Dr. Edwards, that the\nonly possible therapy was a liver transplant, but given the size of the tumor\nit was not medically appropriate.\nDr. Edwards had researched the options. He discovered that the liver\ntransplant center with which the HMO had a contract would not accept\npatients once the tumor size had reached 5 cm. They reasoned that the\nchances of metastatic disease were sufficiently great that the transplant\nwas unlikely to succeed. On that basis, Dr. Edwards had told his patient\nthat the transplant was not medically indicated.\nMr. Villanueva gradually realized that this was a death sentence. The\nliver cancer would continue to develop until it took his life. He began re-\nsearching the treatment options. He had amassed a sizable estate and\ntraveled internationally reviewing start-up enterprises in which he could\ninvest. He discovered that there was general agreement in the transplant\nworld that liver grafts should not be attempted once the tumor had reached\nthis size but that two centers in the United States and one in Sweden were\nperforming transplants on an experimental basis.\nOn the basis of this discovery Mr. Villanueva returned to his HMO and\nasked if he could once again be considered, given the fact that death was\nthe certain alternative. He expressed concern that his wife and small child\nwould be left without a father and income provider, should he die. When\nDr. Edwards again refused to recommend him for transplant, Mr. Villanueva\ndiscovered that he could appeal his clinician's decision.\nThe case was appealed to the medical director, the final HMO authority\nin such cases. The medical director, Dr. Florence Cunningham, received\nMr. Villanueva's appeal. After a week to investigate the facts, she again\ndenied his request, citing both the clinical judgment that the transplant\nwas not medically appropriate and the fact that one-year cancer-free sur-\nvival following transplant in the programs doing experimental grafts for\nprimary liver tumors was only 5-15 percent. If the tumor has not metasta-\n sized, the transplant will remove the cancer, but in most cases cancer cells\nwill already have migrated beyond the liver. She also noted that livers for\ntransplant were very scarce, life-saving resources and should not be used\nfor patients who have such a small chance of successful graft.",

Williams was 20 years old.\" He was publicly identified\nby name as a drug dealer who in upstate New York and New York City had\nintentionally had unprotected sexual relations with as many as three hun-\ndred women and adolescent girls, one as young as thirteen years of age.\nAt least thirteen of them had since been found infected with human.\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mr. Williams had learned of his HIV status\nthe previous September while in Chautauqua County jail on a charge of\nstealing a car. He continued to be sexually active after being told by a\npublic health nurse of his HIV status.\nMr. Williams kept a list of his sexual partners. Thus, it would be possi-\nble to identify them, contact them, and offer testing. In the case of pregnan-\ncies, treatment could be provided, lowering the probability that the newborns\nwould acquire the infection. Mr. Williams, who claimed he suffered from\nschizophrenia, had many contacts with health professionals while in jail\nafter being prosecuted by Chautauqua Country District Attorney James\nSubjack. Although it has never been made public whether the diagnosis of\nschizophrenia has been confirmed, his claim provides a reason why his con-\ntacts with health professionals were so extensive.\nTraditionally, health professionals owe a strict duty of confidentiality to\ntheir patients or clients. The World Medical Association's Declaration of\nGeneva states bluntly, “I will respect the secrets that are confided in me.\" It\nalso states that “the health of my patient will be my first consideration.\"\nOther traditional codes require that the health professional remain\ndedicated to the welfare of the patient. In this case, however, the health\nprofessional who learns of Mr. Williams's aggressive and dangerous be-\nhavior would be aware that his sexual partners are at serious risk from his\nactivity. Moreover, should they become pregnant, their children could re-\nceive life-saving benefit if the women are informed, diagnosed, and treated.\nTheir future sexual partners also have a direct interest in learning of their\nsituation. It is plausible that Mr. Williams has a legal, financial, and psy-\nchological interest in not letting this information be passed to the women\nhe has exposed. If a health professional becomes aware of Mr. Williams's\nbehavior and knows he has a list of the women he has exposed, is that pro-\nfessional's duty exclusively to serve the patient's interest, or must he or she\nin determining the moral duty also take into account the interests of the\nwomen and those associated with them?",

    "case": "Case 5-1\nUnder the Gun: Staying on Schedule in the HMO\nA key concern of a health maintence organization (HMO) is efficiency (production) by the professionals, rather than allowing the MDs, physician's assistants, and nurse practitioners to spend whatever time they think is desirable with individual patients. At a major HMO, patients are scheduled at fifteen-minute intervals. Dr. Daniel Hamilton was seeing Stephanie Wanzer, a 58-year-old high school teacher, for a routine six-month visit during which he monitored her high blood pressure and chronic sinus infections. He repeated the blood pressure readings that had already been taken by the nurse and began an examination of the head and neck. The blood pressure readings were a bit high, 150/90, and he confirmed Ms. Wanzer's complaint that her sinuses were giving her trouble. He reviewed her medications—an ACE inhibitor and an antihistamine—and determined that they could be refilled. He adjusted the ACE inhibitor dose, increasing it slightly.\nAt this point, Ms. Wanzer took out a piece of paper indicating she had several concerns she wanted to raise. She had heard there was a new antihistamine on the market she wanted to ask about. She was also concerned about difficulty sleeping and about a rash that had recently appeared on her upper thigh. This was a pattern Dr. Hamilton had come to expect from her. Generally, he enjoyed having her as a patient. She often had a long list of questions. She was intelligent and took notes on Dr. Hamilton's responses. At the same time, Dr. Hamilton realized he was slipping behind on his schedule. The examination had already consumed ten minutes. He needed the time for evaluation of the symptoms, exploration, and clarification of the physical exam. He had had to wait for the nurse to return as a chaperone for the examination of the rash. He needed the remaining five minutes for ordering tests and recording notes on the computer. He needed to allow time to write the new prescriptions and complete the patient's chart notes. The result was no health education and no consideration of prevention. He felt that he was becoming a test-orderer and prescription writer, usually completed by rapid judgment or reasonable guess. This behavior, he believed, was driven by the market system and merely \"first aid,\" far beneath what was owed to a patient in a professional setting. As the fifteen-minute mark passed, Ms. Wanzer was still making her way down her list.\nDr. Hamilton's next patient had arrived fifteen minutes early. She was an 70-year-old patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and was declining with each visit. She was very sick, but Dr. Hamilton feared there was not much he could do but adjust her medication and comfort her, although he knew well that part of his obligation to patients is to spend time with them in any way that might serve their needs for understanding and for emotional support, even if treatment success was not possible.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n.! Should Dr. Hamilton terminate the session with Ms. Wanzer or steal some time from the next patient?\n.! What principle of justice supports your decision?",

She was an undocumented immigrant living in a large East Coast American city. Dialysis, which she received three times a week at the hospital dialysis program, had improved her condition, but it left her physically weak and largely home-bound at a single-room occupancy hotel where she lived. She had no health insurance and was ineligible for Medicaid.\nDr. Jeffrey Morsch, her primary care physician, had taken her case two months earlier and was responsible for her treatment at the clinic where she was an outpatient. He knew that, given her serious medical condition and desperate financial situation, she was unlikely to thrive. She had no one to care for her in the hotel room and was not eating well. Her treatment costs were being absorbed by the hospital, which meant they were being passed on to Dr. Morsch's other patients in the form of higher fees for their dialysis: This practice is sometimes referred to as \"cost-shifting.\"\nDr. Morsch knew that if Ms. Hawthorne and similar nonpaying patients continued receiving unfunded dialysis at the clinic, other services for other patients, some of which Dr. Morsch believed would be more beneficial, would have to be forgone. He was also the physician-in-charge for these other patients.\nThe alternative for Dr. Morsch was to discharge Ms. Hawthorne and urge her to return to Jamaica where her family could provide better support. He had no idea whether she would receive dialysis once she got home. Since Ms. Hawthorne is not doing well on the clinic's dialysis program and could find a more supportive environment in Jamaica, does Dr. Morsch owe it to his other patients to discharge her?\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n) An estimated 11.2 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States.

He had screamed most of the night, leading her to call Dr. Richard Rust early the next morning. He was able to work Tommy into his schedule at the end of the afternoon appointments.\nJust as he had suspected, Dr. Rust found a case of otitis media, typical of young children. Dr. Rust was certain that it was a common viral infection that would resolve in a few days. The medical evidence had accumulated, showing no long-term ill effects of what can be an unpleasant but relatively benign infection. He urged Mrs. Beauclair to keep Tommy away from other children but offered no medication.\nMrs. Beauclair asked rather aggressively if Tommy could have an antibiotic. She wanted to do something for him.\nDr. Rust explained that antibiotics were only effective against bacterial infections and that there was almost no chance that Tommy's ear problems were caused by bacteria. He also explained that extensive use of antibiotics when they are not necessary can lead to the development of resistant strains of bacteria. This could eventually mean that some child will develop an infection from the resistant strain and suffer consequences much more serious than Tommy's earache because antibiotics had been used too often to attempt to treat minor infections, especially those that the antibiotic is very unlikely to help.\nMrs. Beauclair responded by stating rather angrily that she was Tommy's mother, not the mother of all the children in the future. She pressed Dr. Rust on whether there was any chance—even a small one—that Tommy's infection was from a bacterium that could respond to the antibiotic. She wanted to do everything possible to make sure Tommy did not spend another night like he had spent the previous one.\nDr. Rust had always accepted the common wisdom that antibiotics were being overused and should be avoided except in cases in which they are necessary to avoid serious medical problems. The antibiotics, he believed, should be saved for the truly most needy cases. Still, he acknowledged to himself that the risks of today’s antibiotics are very low and that there was some small mathematical chance that Tommy had a bacterial infection that would respond to the antibiotic. He realized that, if he focused solely on his patient, Mrs. Beauclair was making a good case.\nMrs. Beauclair made him realize that, as a physician who had always been committed to the Hippocratic Oath, his job was really more to serve the interests of his patient, just as a mother’s job is to protect her child. Neither was in a role in which they were supposed to pursue the best interests of some imagined needy hypothetical persons in the more distant future. Should Dr. Rust consider these more needy people or remain committed to maximizing Tommy's welfare?\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n.. In this case, a mother is asking for a treatment for her child that could have negative impact on other children in the distant future. How does this differ, if at all, from public health requirements for vaccinations for children to protect them from communicable diseases such as pertussis or measles? What if a parent refuses such vaccinations for her child? Should physicians consider promotion of public health their primary duty or remain committed to the care of the individual child?",

    "case": "Case 5-4\nAllocating Livers for Transplant\nIn the late 1990s, controversy arose over the national policy in the United States for allocating livers obtained from deceased donors. Such livers are very scarce and offer life-saving benefit to those patients in liver failure who are chosen to receive them. At the point that the controversy erupted, livers were allocated first to the organ procurement organization (OPO) in the metropolitan area in which the liver was procured. There are approximately many such OPOs in the country. Within the OPO, the organs were allocated according to a number of factors. Those near death normally in intensive care were given priority. Only if no one locally could use an organ would it be offered by the local OPO to another area of the country. This was the policy, even if the liver could have gone to a patient in some other area who was in desperate need and near death for lack of a liver. The relatively healthy local patients got priority over the most urgent cases beyond the local area.\nThe federal officials in the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) challenged this policy, demanding that there be greater equity or fairness in the allocation of livers. A rule was established requiring the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the organ procurement and transplantation network controlling all organ allocation in the United States, to develop a policy that would spread livers more fairly. Officials at UNOS resisted the rule. They did not deny that livers were more readily available in some communities than others and that the result was that some people who were very ill had a high probability of being transplanted, while equally sick people in other communities had a much lower chance of getting an organ. They argued, however, that there were significant benefits of the \"locals-first\" policy that led to greater overall good being done than if livers were transported to the sickest patients in other communities.\nFirst, they noted that the transportation of the livers itself meant livers suffered potential damage from greater \"cold-ischemia time,\" that is, time when the livers were not receiving blood. Second, they argued that the sickest patients were often the most difficult to treat. They had less of a chance of surviving with a donated liver than the healthier local patients currently receiving the organs. Finally, they claimed that a locals-first policy had the effect of increasing willingness of grieving families to donate a loved one's organs. If \"locals\" believed it was going to help a neighbor, transplant personnel believed this would increase the likelihood of donation. In short, at least three reasons supported a policy of keeping the organs locally unless there was no one locally who could use them, even if the recipients were relatively healthy.\nThe government officials, led by then-Secretary of HHS Donna Shalala, pressed for a more fair system even if the impact was a decrease in the number of life years expected per organ transplanted and a decrease in the supply of organs. Officials at DHHS challenged the claim that locals-first would increase the rate of donation. They claimed there were no data to support this belief, but insisted that, even if this were true, the moral mandate had to be to produce an organ allocation system that was fair. This, they said, meant equally sick patients throughout the United States should have an equal chance of getting an organ. This could be accomplished only by transporting organs to other OPOs when necessary. Should the liver allocation system be maximally fair or maximally efficient at producing added years of life from organ transplant?",

A crack and cocaine user, admitting to multiple sex partners, he was married and the father of one child. Examination confirmed renal and/or heart failure, and lab studies determined he was indeed in kidney failure. His diagnoses were terminal acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), end-stage renal disease, chronic anemia, and possible bloodstream infection (sepsis).\nHe refused additional diagnostic procedures and blood transfusion. Antibiotic therapy was instituted. Generally, he was poorly compliant with medical advice. He also had spells of crying and apparent depression. The physicians assessed his mental competency as adequate for decision-making and discussed with him and his family options for advance directives, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which he declined. Hemodialysis was not offered as a treatment option because it would be of \"no benefit to life expectancy.\" (The nephrology consultant agreed.) After three days of hospitalization, he was transferred to a hospice program.",

He was 69 years old, moder-\nately obese, hypertensive, and diabetic. Initial evaluations indicated\nsevere ischemic heart disease, believed to be life threatening. A recent di-\nagnosis of dementia had been made, but his competency to make autono-\nmous decisions was variable. Dr. Nina Sandstedt considered cardiac\ncatheterization necessary before any cardiac operative procedure could be planned.\nOn evaluation by Dr. Sandstedt and consultants, Mr. Maxwell was\nnoted to be awake, showing capacity for pleasure and pain, but disori-\nented.

He could identify her by name.\nEvaluation of surgical mortality of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)\nfor him suggested he had approximately a 10 percent chance of not surviv-\ning the procedure. Postoperative pain following placement of coronary\nbypass grafts would be considerable but could be controlled with medica-\ntion. Pneumonia and other complications could occur.\nThe professional dilemmas included satisfactory assessment of\nMr. Maxwell's mental capacity for decision-making,and successive discus-\nsions with him or surrogates as options for surgical treatment were clari-\nfied.

There was general agreement that the\nprobable benefits of surgical intervention outweighed his risks and pos-\nsible complications. On the other hand, she knew some patients with\nMr. Maxwell's degree of chronic heart impairment who had refused such\nprocedures. When Mr. Maxwell was asked, he seemed to resist the pro-\nposal of an operation, but his capacity to refuse consent was questionable.\nDr. Sandstedt knew she could not operate without a valid consent. Mr. Maxwell\nhad not discussed questions of life-prolonging treatment prior to the devel-\nopment of his dementia.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould the physician rely on Mr. Maxwell's apparent refusal?\n.

    "case": "Case 6-2\nA Mature 12-Year-Old Who Refuses a Heart Transplant\nTwelve-year-old Emma Ogden had suffered all her life from a congenital\nheart defect that had led to over forty operations during her short life. Still,\nshe was not doing well. She suffered cardiac episodes periodically while\nin school or at play leading to repeated calls to the emergency medical\nservices (EMS) personnel. Up to this point, they had always been able to\nresuscitate her and transport her to the emergency room (ER) where eventu-\nally her condition was stabilized.\nNow Dr. Abdul Hamid, the transplant surgeon at the hospital, had in-\nformed Emma and her parents that her only long-term hope was a heart\ntransplant. The child's condition was so severe that she would not survive\nmuch longer without the operation. Even with a transplant, her prognosis\nwas not good: no more than 10-20 percent chance of five-year survival with\nlikely repeated crises related to her damaged lungs and circulatory\nsystem.\nEmma was a remarkable child. She had recently been conducting\nclass sessions in school trying to help her classmates understand what\nwas happening when she would lose consciousness in school, leading to\nrescue personnel rushing in and her fellow students being evacuated from\nthe classroom until she could be removed. She had written an essay pub-\nlished in their local community newspaper describing her situation. The\nteachers had told her parents that, in spite of her many missed school days\nover the years, she tested three years above her grade level.\nShe had read everything she could find about her condition. She knew\nher chances of survival were not good. She had had about all she could\ntake of hospitals, operations, and medical crises. After considerable\nthought she came to the conclusion that the transplant was not worth it. She\nknew the alternative was certain death in the near future. She had also\ncome to understand that an adult in this position would have the legal right\nto refuse consent for the procedure. She told Dr. Hamid that she did not\nwant the transplant.\nShe had discussed the matter at length with her parents, who had re-\nluctantly come to understand her position. They would support her if that is\nwhat she wanted to do.\nDr. Hamid was taken aback. In all his years of cardiac transplant sur-\ngery, he had never had a case like this one. Occasionally, an elderly patient\nwho was rapidly declining and had been advised that he or she was un-\nlikely to survive heart transplant had accepted his advice and declined the\nextreme procedure, but never before had he been confronted with a refusal\nby a 12-year-old who could potentially survive many years if everything\nworked just right.\n\nDr. Hamid considered the possibility of getting consent from her par-\nents but realized that they might also refuse. He turned to an ethics com-\nmittee, who explained to him that some adolescent minors were considered\nsufficiently mature that they had the authority to make medical decisions\non their own behalf. (Some pregnant adolescents have consented to abor-\ntion on this basis, for instance.) On the other hand, the committee members\nhad never invoked the mature minor rule on someone as young as 12 and\nfor a decision as momentous as a life-ending transplant refusal. Their al-\nternative was to treat her as other 12-year-olds, some of whom might ex-\npress resistance to needed medical procedures. Parental consent is\nnormally acceptable in such cases. However, since the parents might\nthemselves refuse, his only option would be to seek a court order to oper-\nate against the wishes of both the girl and her parents. Should he accept\nthe girl's refusal, rely on the parents’ judgment, or attempt to get the court\norder?",

The examination was\npart of Dr. Newlander’s standard procedure to look for any dermatological .\nproblems. On Ms. Harris's back, Dr. Newlander saw a brown, mole-like spot\nthat alarmed him. The color was varied; the edges ragged. He could not\nrecall seeing it before.\n\nDr. Newlander's first thought was that it looked rather like it could\nbe melanoma. Of course, he would not know without excising the tissue\nand getting a report from the lab. He wanted the tissue removed as soon as\npossible and asked Ms. Harris to schedule an appointment. Dr. Newlander\nsuggested an opening in his schedule later in the week.\n\nMs. Harris asked him what the hurry was. She asked him, “Do you\nthink it is cancer or something?” That was precisely Dr. Newlander's con-\ncern, but he did not wish to alarm her and, in fact, could not know without\nthe lab results. He was strongly committed to dealing honestly with patients\nbut knew that he did not know the full answer to her question. How should\nhe respond to her question?\n\nCase 7-2\nPlacebos for Addiction Withdrawal\nSeventy-four-year-old Mrs. Abraham had been getting the prescription\nfilled for years. She had a malignancy of the colon four years previously.\nAn operation had corrected the problem, but in the emotional and physical\ndistress that followed, Mrs. Abraham had a terrible time sleeping. She\nhad received a prescription from her internist, Dr. Raymond Siemens, for\nSeconal® to help her sleep and continued taking them to the point at which\nshe could not sleep without them. Her physician, after several months, real-\nized that he had caused her to become addicted and felt that it was his duty\nto help her break her habit. He had arranged with the pharmacist to take\nSeconal® capsules and gradually replace more and more of the active in-\ngredient, until some months later she was on pure lactose packaged in the\n\n\ndistinctive Seconal® capsules. She still claimed, however, that she could\nnot sleep without her sleeping pills.\n\nDr. Siemens firmly believed that it was in his patient's best interest, but\nhe felt uncomfortable about the placebo prescription he was writing. He\nwas concerned about potential legal implications of lack of informed con-\nsent. (He surely had not informed his patient of the treatment strategy and\nthe risks and benefits of the “drug” he was now prescribing.) Furthermore,\nhe was asking the pharmacist to mislabel the prescription, placing the\ndrug name on the prescription label when, in fact, it contained nothing but\ninert lactose. Mislabeling was against the law. He was concerned about\nthe fact that Mrs. Abraham was paying monthly for the prescription that\ncontained no active ingredients. The charge was modest, barely covering\nthe cost of the capsules’ ingredients that were being discarded, surely not\ncompensating the pharmacist for the extra time involved in emptying the\ncapsules and refilling them. But most of all he was concerned about\nwhether he was being dishonest.\n\nCase 7-3\nConfessing an Error in Judgment: Is It Necessary?\nEmilia Hedges is a 68-year-old woman who saw her primary care physician,\nLawrence Aleman, soon after experiencing sudden slurring of speech and ©\nbrief weakness in the right upper arm. She reported that the episode lasted _\nabout thirty minutes, with clearing of all symptoms. Dr. Aleman prescribed «a n /\naspirin and asked her to report back if any similar symptoms returned. _\nThree days later she was hospitalized with a major left-sided cerebral\nvascular accident (CVA), or stroke. An ultrasound examination of the left _\ncarotid artery revealed a 98 percent narrowing (called an “pinpointO”n) t.h e\nneurology service, Ms. Hedges was treated with anticoagulants (blood .\nthinners). A month later, an operation was performed to remove the clot —\n(a procedure called an endarterectomy). She subsequently was left with _\nmarked weakness of the right upper arm and some impairment o¢ fh er Co\nspeech. _\nDr. Aleman was terribly distressed by this outcome. He felt guilta bou! |\nmissing the signs of a transient ischemic attack that indicated a ‘severe. /\nobstruction of blood flow to the left side of the brain, affecting the rightarm _\nand the speech center. He realized there were more things he could have ©\ndone during Ms. Hedges'’s initial visit, such as listening to the carotid arter-\nies with a stethoscope. Hearing a murmur suggesting blockage is clinically\nhelpful, even if it is not definitive. Also, he could have ordered sso me nonin- —\nvasive diagnostic tests to narrow the possibilities.\n\nNow he faces the dilemma of whether he should say something to —\nMs. Hedges about the fact that he realizes he could have, probably should ~\nhave, done more for her. Primary care physicians are frequently placed in\na position in which they are not sure whether they ought to refer a patient _\nto a specialist. That comes with the territory of being a general internist or\nprimary care doctor. Dr. Aleman’s question is whether, when he realizes he _\nmade the wrong judgment, he should say something to his patient about it\n\nCase 7-4\nRefusing to Learn about Cancer\nWesley Crossman was a 43-year-old real estate broker who had just been\nhospitalized for persistent pain in the bone of his right hip. At first he\nthought he must have pulled a muscle, but the pain gradually became\nmore severe. About six months ago, after he had endured the pain for\n\n\nalmost a month, he went to his family physician, who made a tentative di-\nagnosis of arthritis. After several months of treatment with indomethacin,\nan antiarthritic drug, during which time the pain became unbearable, re-\nerral was made to an orthopedic specialist for further tests.\n\nMr. Crossman was the proprietor of a small agency in a suburb of\nPhoenix, Arizona, in the path of urban growth. Although only marginally\nsuccessful, he earned enough to support his wife and three children, who\nwere now 18, 14, and 12. The rapid development of the area gave him new\nhope for some promising real estate speculation. After overcoming his\nwife's concerns about the financial risks, he invested $20,000 from their\nsavings account in a development project. It would take a few years to pay\noff, but he was tired of making fortunes on land for everyone else while he\nand his family made so little.\n\nMr. Crossman felt tense when he went to the appointment with Dr. Marvin\nGreenblatt, the orthopedic specialist. He had not said anything explicit to\nhis wife, but they were both thinking about the neighbor who had succumbed\nto bone cancer. During the examination, Mr. Crossman remarked that he\nwas a busy man and mentioned his real estate deal to Dr. Greenblatt when\nhe was asked what he did for a living. Then Mr. Crossman got down to\nbusiness and stated, “Doctor, you do what you have to do to get rid of this\npain,” he said. “Put me in the hospital if you have to, but don't trouble me\nwith all the details. Do what you think is best. Even if it’s awful, I'd just as\nsoon not know.” Both Mr. Crossman and Dr. Greenblatt knew that “cancer”\nwas the word he would not or could not say.\n\nDr. Greenblatt had seen patients like Mr. Crossman before. Some pa-\nients give signals, just as clear as can be, that a diagnosis of a terminal\nillness would be more than they could handle psychologically. Dr. Greenblatt\nasked himself, however, “Does he have a right not to know the truth?”\n\nCase 7-5\nA Clash of Cultures: A Japanese Family Asks That Their Father\nNot Be Told of Cancer\nThe surgeon, Dr. Phyllis Rollins, had just examined the patient after refer-\nral from an internist. Dr. Rollins was part of a large oncology practice in a\nlarge, West Coast American city. Mr. Nikki previously had endoscopy and\nbiopsy of the stomach confirming a very large cancer. Since Mr. Nikki spoke\nlittle English, his son came into the room to help. The patient's wife took the\npatient into another room beyond hearing distance. Then the surgeon fully\nexplained the nature of the malignancy, that an operation was clearly indi-\ncated, and that the father must be given that information, including the\nprocess of preparation, the prognosis, the risks, probable outcomes, and\nother details so that truly informed consent may be obtained.\n\nAbruptly, the son replied that if his father were told the diagnosis, “he\nwill wither up and die.” Dr. Rollins replied that she could not proceed with\nsurgical care of Mr. Nikki without his understanding of and agreement toa\nmajor operation. “You just don’t understand ‘the Japanese way’—in Japan,\nthe word ‘cancer’ cannot be mentioned to the person who is ill,” said the\n_son. He proposed that Dr. Rollins tell Mr. Nikki nothing and prepare for\nsurgical treatment secretly. Dr. Rollins withdrew from the case, providing\nsome other surgeons’ names to the family. Later, she learned that the pa-\ntient had been operated upon at another hospital, presumably without\nbeing told of his diagnosis.\n\nCase 7-6 :\nDisclosing Cancer to a Mentally Compromised Patient\nA 64-year-old man, David Younis, was brought to the emergency room (ER)\nafter his wife found him suddenly disoriented and incoherent. Mr. Younis\nwas known at the hospital for alcohol dependence, with cirrhosis of the\nliver. Examination revealed liver enlargement including a mass that was\nconfirmed with a computed tomography (CT) scan. He was admitted to the\nhospital, and a biopsy of the mass was scheduled. Mr. Younis’s mental\nstatus improved; his wife requested that he not be told if the diagnosis was\nmalignant. Mrs. Younis said that if he learns he has cancer, he will kill\nhimself. Dr. Andre Caldarone, the hepatologist (liver specialist), then can-\nceled the biopsy procedure.\n\nCase 7-7\nA Psychiatric Patient’s Right to See Her Medical Record\nClaire Mowry was a 38-year-old, single woman who had worked intermit-\ntently over the past ten years as a secretary. She had had difficulty keeping\njobs because she would regularly engage in disputes with fellow employ-\n\n\nees, accusing them of not carrying their load of the office work, criticizing\ntheir work, and in one case reporting a fellow worker to the supervisor for\nconsistently showing up late for work.\n\nCurrently out of work, she was seeing Martin Gaskell, a psychiatrist\nworking with the mental health clinic of the health maintenance organiza-\ntion (HMO) of her previous employer. Ms. Mowry was currently paying out-\nof-pocket so her HMO coverage could continue.\n\nDr. Gaskell had now had four appointments with Ms. Mowry. He had\nidentified patterns of what appeared to be paranoid thinking and had\ngenerally come to find her an unpleasant, difficult patient. She clearly did\nnot have a major psychiatric disorder. She was not psychotic—a paranoid\nschizophrenic—but she had personality traits that were causing her\nproblems.\n\nBy the end of her fourth visit with Dr. Gaskell, Ms. Mowry had become\nconvinced that Dr. Gaskell did not like her. She thought he seemed to be\nimplying that her employment problems were her own fault and that she\nneeded further therapy to address these issues. Ms. Mowry suspected that\nDr. Gaskell was keeping notes on her that would reflect his poor opinion of\nher. She asked to see her medical record.\n\nWhen Dr. Gaskell hesitated, Ms. Mowry indicated that she would\nreport him to the management of the HMO. Patients in the United States\nhave the right to review their medical records. However, some moral uncer-\ntainty still exists. In particular, many physicians, especially psychiatrists,\nare concerned that granting patients the right to see their records may\nharm patients as well as violate the privacy rights of the provider. Regard-\nless of the law, what is an ethically appropriate decision by Dr. Gaskell?",

She had been diagnosed a month\nearlier with hypertension (175/95). Dr. Fantaw had prescribed the generic\nfor Microzide (hydrochlorothiazide) and Prinivil (lisinopril) and told her to\nschedule an appointment for follow-up.\nMs. Anderson had been bothered by jitteriness and loss of appetite\nsince taking the medication, so she was eager to discuss these problems\nwith Dr. Fantaw to see if they might be related to her medication. She had\naccepted a 1:30 p.m. appointment, which was the only one available even\nthough she was responsible for picking up her grandson after school at\n3 p.m. Since the HMO placed its physicians on a regimen of ten minutes per\npatient for such routine follow-up appointments, Ms. Anderson figured she\nwould be done in plenty of time.\nMs. Anderson arrived at 1:15 p.mm. She registered, ae her co-payment,\nand took a seat in the waiting room with about ten others. By 1:40 p.m. she had\nnot been called by the nurse and was beginning to get nervous. By 1:50 p.m.\nshe was more uncomfortable since her grandson's school was about a half\nhour away from the HMO offices. No one had said anything to her about the\ndelay so she asked the receptionist what was happening.\nThe receptionist said that Dr. Fantaw had been running behind all\nday, a rather common pattern for him. He had spent twenty-five minutes\nwith a patient that morning who had an unusually complicated set of prob-\nlems. As a clinician deeply committed to high-quality medical care for his\npatients, he often found himself pressured to go a bit over the ten-minute\ntime period. By this point in the afternoon he was running about forty-five\nminutes behind.\nMs. Anderson wondered why the receptionist had not told her all of this\nwhen she registered. She also wondered why, if this was a common pattern\nfor Dr. Fantaw, some action was not taken to address the issue of his regu-\nlar inability to stay on time.\n\nCase 8-2\nI Will Be There for You at the End: A Promise Broken?\nMabel Dacosta, an 80-year-old woman, was an end-stage cancer patient\nwho had been admitted twelve days earlier to the inpatient hospice unit at\nCity Hospital. She was now in the last stages of her illness under the care\nof the hospice team including Chris Humphries, MD, and Lois Kiger, RN, the\nprimary nurse. She had also been visited regularly by the chaplain, a social\nworker, and a hospice volunteer. Her needs were met well even though she\nhad no immediate family or friends who called upon her.\nMs. Dacosta had been quite depressed and nervous when under the\ncare of her oncologist, but the transfer to the hospice unit had been reassur-\ning. One of her key concerns was that she did not want to die alone. She\nrepeatedly expressed her concern to Dr. Humphries, the hospice medical\ndirector, who said the team would be there to keep her comfortable twenty-\nfour hours a day. She asked Dr. Humphries if he personally would be there\nwhen she died. He pointed out that he could not be present twenty-four\nhours a day, seven days a week, but he said, if he possibly could, he would\nbe at her bedside when the time came.\nAs Ms. Dacosta declined, she spent most of her time sleeping. She\nappeared to recognize none of the staff when she was awake. When the\nday came when the team realized she would probably not last long,\nDr. Humphries remembered his commitment. He completed his rounds\nand stopped at Ms. Dacosta’s room. She did not appear to recognize him,\nbut he sat in the chair near her. He was able to complete his notes for the\ncharts of other patients. After some time, Ms. Kiger appeared at the door.\nAnother patient was in serious pain and needed his attention. She offered\nto stay with Ms. Dacosta, but Dr. Humphries remembered his commitment\nto her.\nHe realized that she would not know whether he was actually present\nat her death and that no one else had heard him make the commitment to\nstay with her. He knew that Ms. Kiger was an excellent nurse who could\ndo everything that could assist Ms. Dacosta at least as well or better than\nhe could but that he was the best person to work up the patient who\nneeded a new pain regimen. He realized that he could do more good for\nhis two patients if he broke his promise to Ms. Dacosta and that he had\nexplicitly mentioned to her that he could not be present twenty-four hours\na day. At the same time he knew he had promised her his presence. A resi-\ndent on the hospice unit could work up the patient in pain and give hima\nreport on what she recommended. Did he make a promise, and should he\nbreak it?\n\nCase 8-3\nContinuing Treatment of a Patient Who Will Not Pay Her Bills\nA thoracic surgeon, Beau Schenker, MD, was called to the Emergency De-\npartment to evaluate and treat Nelda Thomas, a 40-year-old female who\nhad chest pain of sudden onset. Her history pointed to lung disease, not\ncardiac problems. The exam revealed decreased breath sounds in the left\nchest, and x-rays confirmed free air in the chest that had collapsed the left\nlung. Dr. Schenker determined that the patient had a spontaneous pneumo-\nthorax. He discussed with Ms. Thomas the well-established treatment: a\nchest tube. Dr. Schenker stated, “We will need to insert a small tube into\nyour chest to withdraw the air and allow the lung to re-expand.”\nMs. Thomas and her husband were relieved to learn that the chest pain\nwas not the result of a heart problem and agreed quickly to the procedure,\nwhich was successful.\nDuring the brief hospital stay, Dr. Schenker and Mr. Thomas, the pa-\ntient's husband, reminisced about their days in high school since they co-\nincidentally attended the same school. Ms. Thomas was seen several times\nfor appropriate follow-up in Dr. Schenker's office after her hospitalization.\nSeveral months later, Dr. Schenker’s business manager reported that the\nbalance of Ms. Thomas's bill had not been paid. Since Dr. Schenker’s office\nhad a policy of not using collection companies, Dr. Schenker said “write the\nbill off.”\nTwo years later, Ms. Thomas was once again in the emergency room\n(ER) for recurrence of the same problem. She requested to be seen by\nDr. Schenker. When the Emergency Department paged Dr. Schenker, he ad-\nvised the staff to call another available thoracic surgeon to see Ms. Thomas.\nA few minutes later, Mr. Thomas called Dr. Schenker directly at his office.\nMr. Thomas admitted he had not paid the earlier bill (although Dr. Schenker\nhad not brought up the matter) and promised to pay the old balance and\nthen prepay for the costs of his wife's current needs. Dr. Schenken replied,\n“It's not about the money but about mutual respect. I am sorry but I cannot\ntake care of your wife at this time. Another thoracic surgeon will take the\ncase so you have nothing to worry about.” Ms. Thomas was treated suc-\ncessfully by another physician. Should Dr. Schenker have relented and\ntaken the case the second time?\n\nCase 8-4\nA GP Assisting in Surgical Operations:\nStealing Business and Harming Patients?\nAfter completing a lengthy and prestigious residency program, a young\nsurgeon, Diane Daemer, began the difficult process of establishing a solo\npractice. She took frequent calls from ERs, did insurance physical exams,\nwent to all hospital staff meetings, did not take vacation, and so on. The\npractice grew slowly, and she was gratified when a busy general practitio-\nner, David Parish, referred a patient with lung cancer for her evaluation.\nWhen an operation was recommended, the referring doctor asked to assist\nin the procedure, a custom not unusual in her community. She agreed and\nthe procedure subsequently went well, after her usual meticulous preop-\nerative care and communication with all parties.\nThree weeks later, the same GP referred a patient who needed a par-\ntial resection of the stomach. Again, Dr. Parish assisted in the operation.\nFurther operative cases followed. Then Dr. Parish spoke of his interest in\ndoing “simple operations like hernia repairs and appendectomies” with\nDr. Daemer assisting him. She politely refused, feeling manipulated be-\ncause of the previous referrals, and was unwilling to “cover” the lack of\nsurgical credentials of the other. The surgeon came to believe that the ar-\nrangement was a deception, clearly not in the interest of the patients.\n\nCase 8-5 :\nProfiting from Self-Referral for MRIs\nFor many years internist Jonathan Birch had performed x-rays on his pa-\ntients in his private office. He billed them a reasonable charge for the time\nand materials involved, including enough to amortize the costs of the\nequipment. By the late 1980s Dr. Birch was making increased use of more\nsophisticated imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. By comparison, this equip-\nment was extremely expensive and would not be utilized sufficiently to\njustify having the equipment in his office. He began referring patients\nneeding this type of diagnostic test to an imaging center at the local hos-\npital. Patients were billed directly by the hospital. This had the effect of\nreducing Dr. Birch’s income that he used to derive from the simpler in-\noffice procedures.\nIn 1989 Dr. Birch was approached by Imaging Resources, Inc., about a\nnew free-standing imaging facility it was launching. Dr. Birch was invited\nto visit the facility and inspect its state-of-the-art equipment. Dr. Birch was\nimpressed. He considered it better than the hospital's facility and was con-\nsidering shifting his referrals to the new center.\nThe director of the center then presented an offer to Dr. Birch. He was\ninvited to invest in the center. He could buy a 1 percent interest in the facil-\nity with income on the investment projected as 12 percent. Furthermore, the\nfacility would loan Dr. Birch the money he needed to make the investment\nat 6 percent interest with the interest and principal paid off with the earn-\nings on the investment. As soon as the investment was paid off, Dr. Birch\nwould own his share in the company and would receive profits on his\nownership.\nDr. Birch realized that the more patients he referred, the better the im-\naging business would do. In effect, he would be able to recoup some of the\nincome he had lost when he shifted from x-rays in his office to the use of the\noutside imaging facility at the hospital. Dr. Birch was vaguely uncomfort-\nable with the offer he received. It could be interpreted as giving him an\nownership interest in order to influence his decisions about when to order\nimaging and what facility to recommend. He was made more uncomfort-\nable when he learned that only physicians were being offered the favor-\nable investment terms. He learned that only colleagues who did substantial\namounts of referral for imaging were approached. Even so, Dr. Birch accepted\nthe offer and the loan.\n\nFollow-up\nBy 1991 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was taking action\nagainst some of these joint-venture investment schemes that gave the ap-\npearance of being designed to provide financial incentives to physicians to\nchannel business to certain imaging centers. There were accusations of\nkickbacks. In response, the government issued regulations that provided\n“safe harbors,” provisions which, if met, would give physicians assurance\nthat they would not be guilty of violating anti-kickback laws. The original\nprovisions made clear that investment in large, public corporations (such as\ndrug companies) was acceptable, that physicians could provide services to\njoint ventures for a reasonable fee, and that investment terms (such as the\nloan received by Dr. Birch) had to be available to all investors, not just doc-\ntors who referred patients.* Later amendments clarified these provisions, but\nthey remain in place essentially as originally promulgated. More recently,\nregulations governing self-referral have appeared in 2\n...[TRUNCATED]",

    "case": "Case 9-1]\nJack Kevorkian: Merciful Homicide, Suicide,\nand Forgoing Life Support\nFifty-two-year-old Thomas Youk suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclero-\nosis (ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease). In the fall of 1998, he was\nhaving difficulty breathing and swallowing. He contacted Jack Kevorkian,\nknown as “Dr. Death.” Dr. Kevorkian, a pathologist whose license to prac-\ntice medicine had been revoked, had through the 1990s assisted in the\n168 |\nPart 2 Ethical Principles in Medical Ethics\n\nsuicides of over one hundred people who had requested help in ending\ntheir lives. Prior to the case of Mr. Youk, apparently all of the deaths in\nwhich Kevorkian had been involved were suicides. Dr. Kevorkian provided\ncounsel and then helped the individuals by inserting an intravenous (IV)\nline or attaching a mask. Harmless saline or air was initially flowing\nthrough the equipment. In these cases, the patients themselves took the\nlast step in the chain of events that led to their deaths. They turned a stop-\ncock or control so that lethal potassium chloride or carbon monoxide began\nto flow, the eventual cause of the deaths.\n\nSince the patients themselves took the action responsible for their\ndeaths, these were considered assisted suicides rather than homicides. Even\nassisting in a suicide has generally been considered illegal. Dr. Kevorkian\nwas prosecuted no fewer than three times. In each of these cases he was\nacquitted. The jurors, perhaps out of sympathy for his actions, found some\nreason for finding him not guilty. Problems in proving his involvement, in\nestablishing the jurisdiction, or other technicalities were sometimes cited.\nIn Thomas Youk’s case, he was suffering from a disease that caused\nparalysis while leaving him mentally lucid. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's\nassistance in ending his life but was physically not able to take the final\naction leading to his death. He requested that Dr. Kevorkian inject a lethal\nsubstance to end his life.\n\nDr. Kevorkian had long been attempting to change the law about inten-\ntional merciful killing. To force the issue before the courts and general\npublic, he videotaped the final moments of Mr. Youk’s life and released the\nvideo to the CBS television program 60 Minutes.\n\nOn September 15, Dr. Kevorkian went to Mr. Youk’s home to discuss his\nsituation. The interaction was videotaped showing Mr. Youk requesting\nhelp in “ending his suffering.” Dr. Kevorkian indicated that Youk needed to\nagree to a statement: a consent to “direct injection.” The statement to which\nhe agreed read:\n\n“I, Thomas Youk, the undersigned, entirely voluntarily, without any res-\nervation, external persuasion, pressure, or duress, and after prolonged and\nthorough deliberation, hereby consent to the following medical procedure\nof my own choosing, and that I have chosen direct injection, or what they\ncall active euthanasia, to be administered by a competent medical profes-\nsional, in order to end with certainty my intolerable and hopelessly incur-\nable suffering.”\n\nOn September 16, 1998, at 9:49 p.m., Dr. Kevorkian again videotaped his\ninteraction with Mr. Youk. After asking Mr. Youk to reaffirm his desire to go\nthrough with the plan, Dr. Kevorkian injected Anectine (a paralyzing drug)\nand Seconal (a sedative) before injecting potassium chloride (a lethal drug\nthat stops the heart). Most people who have viewed the videotape have no\ndoubt that Mr. Youk knew exactly what was happening, was mentally lucid,\nand desired to have the injection.\n\nChapter 9 Avoidance of Killing 169\n\nDr. Kevorkian was tried before the Oakland County, Michigan, Circuit\nCourt, found guilty of second degree murder, and sentenced to 10-25 years\nin jail. He was paroled on June 1, 2007.°\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n1 Would you consider Dr. Kevorkian’s actions active killing?\n1 Consider the place in the case where you initially have the feeling that some-\nthing is not right or morally correct.

    "case": "Case 9-2\nKaren Quinlan: The Case of Withdrawing a Ventilator\nOn the night of April 15, 1975, friends of 21-year-old Karen Quinlan sum-\nmoned the local police and emergency rescue squad, and she was taken to\nNewton Memorial Hospital. The precise events leading up to her admission\nto Newton Memorial Hospital are unclear. She apparently ceased breath-\ning for at least two fifteen-minute periods. Mouth-to -mouth resuscitation\nwas applied by her friends the first time and by a police respirator the\nsecond time. The exact amount of time she was without spontaneous respi-\nration is unknown.\n\nUpon her admission to Newton Memorial, urine and blood tests indi-\ncated the presence of quinine, aspirin, and barbiturates in normal range as\nwell as traces of valium and Librium. Dr. Robert Morse, the neurologist in\ncharge of her care, found the drugs to be in the therapeutic range and the\nquinine consistent with mixing in drinks like soda water. The interruption\nin respiration apparently caused anoxia—insufficient supply of oxygen in\nthe blood—resulting in her present condition.\n\nAt 10 p.m. on April 16, 1975, Dr. Morse again examined Karen. He found\nher in a coma with evidence of what he called decortication indicating an\naltered level of consciousness. She required the respirator for assistance.\nShe did not breathe spontaneously.\n\nKaren was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of St. Clare’s\nHospital, under the care of Dr. Morse. At the time of her transfer she was\nstill unconscious, still on a respirator, a catheter was inserted into her blad-\nder, and a tracheostomy had been performed.\n\nDr. Morse testified Karen changed from a sleeping comatose condition\nto a sleep-awake type comatose condition but described this as normal in\ncomatose patients and not any indication of improvement. He indicated that\nduring the awake cycle, she was still unconscious. He claimed that Karen\nwas not brain dead but would not return to a level of cognitive function.\nKaren was examined by several experts for the various parties. All\nagreed she was in a persistent vegetative state. She had irreversible brain\ndamage and no cognitive or cerebral functioning; chances for useful sapi-\nent life or return of discriminative functioning were considered remote.\n\nChapter 9 Avoidance of Killing 173\n\nKaren's parents, Joseph and Julia Quinlan, assumed responsibility for the\ncare of their daughter. The decision to request that she be removed from\nthe respirator, understandably, came tortuously, arduously to the Quinlans. At\nthe outset, they authorized Dr. Morse to do everything he could to keep her\nalive, believing she would recover. They participated in a constant vigil\nover her with other family members. They were in constant contact with the\ndoctors, particularly Dr. Morse, receiving day-by-day reports concerning\nher prognosis, which, as time passed, became more and more pessimistic\nand more and more discouraging to them.\n\nMrs. Quinlan and the children were the first to conclude Karen should\nbe removed from the respirator. Mrs. Quinlan, working at the local parish\nchurch, had ongoing talks with Father Trapasso, who supported her conclu-\nsion and indicated that it was a permissible practice within the tenets of\nRoman Catholic teachings.\n\nMr. Quinlan was slower in making his decision. His hope for recovery\ncontinued despite the disheartening medical reports. Neither his wife nor\nFather Trapasso made any attempt to influence him. A conflict existed be-\ntween letting her natural body functioning control her life and the hope for\nrecovery. Once having made the decision, he sought Father Trapasso’s en-\ncouragement, which he received.\n\nFather Trapasso based his support of the position taken by the Quin-\nlans on the traditional, moral precepts of the Roman Catholic faith and\nupon a declaration by Pope Pius XII made on November 24, 1957. Father\nTrapasso acknowledges it is not a sinful act under the church teachings or\nthe Papal statement to either continue extraordinary treatment or discon-\ntinue it. It is acknowledged to be a matter left optional to a Roman Catholic\nbeliever. Mr. Quinlan indicates that had Roman Catholic traditions and\nmorals considered it a sin, he would not be seeking termination of the re-\nspiratory support. Mr. Quinlan held that Karen’s natural bodily functions\nshould be allowed to operate free of the respirator. He stated then, if it is\nGod's will to take her, she can go on to life after death.\n\nThe Quinlans, on July 31, 1975, signed the following statement:\n\nWe authorize and direct Doctor Morse to discontinue all extraordinary mea-\nsures, including the use of a respirator for our daughter Karen Quinlan.\nWe acknowledge that the above-named physician has thoroughly dis-\ncussed the above with us and that the consequences have been fully ex-\nplained to us. Therefore, we hereby RELEASE from any and all liability the\nabove-named physician, associates and assistants of his choice, Saint\nClare's Hospital and its agents and employees.\n\nThe Quinlans, upon signing the release, considered the matter de-\ncided. Dr. Morse, however, felt he could not and would not agree to the ces-\nsation of the respirator assistance. He advised the Quinlans prior to the\n174 Part 2 Ethical Principles in Medical Ethics\n\ntime of their signing the release that he wanted to check into the matter\nfurther before giving his approval. After checking on other medical case\nhistories, he concluded that terminating the respirator would be a substan-\ntial deviation from medical tradition, that it involved ascertaining “quality\nof life,” and that he would not do so.\n\nKaren Quinlan was quoted as saying she never wanted to be kept\nalive by extraordinary means. The statements attributed to her by her\nmother, sister, and a friend are indicated to have been made essentially in\nrelation to instances where close friends or relatives were terminally ill.\n[Karen's father] urges the Court to act in Karen Quinlan’s best interest\nby authorizing the cessation of the respirator. He asserts Karen Quinlan\nand her family have a constitutional right of privacy that lead to a right of\nself-determination which extends to the decision to terminate “futile use\nof extraordinary medical measures.” He also asserts a constitutional right\nof free exercise of religious belief and freedom from cruel and unusual\npunishment as grounds for granting the sought relief.\n\nThe doctors and hospital essentially contend, since Karen Quinlan is\nmedically and legally alive, the Court should not authorize termination of\nthe respirator, that to do so would be homicide and an act of euthanasia.\nThe doctors suggest the decision is one more appropriately made by\ndoctors than by a court of law and that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, a decision in favor of the parents would require ascertainment of\nquality-of-life standards to serve as future guidelines.",

When they discovered Mrs. Attard was carrying\nconjoined twins, they traveled to Manchester, England, since no adequate\nfacility to care for the babies existed at their home. The twins, Gracie and\nRosie, were born at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester on August 8, 2000.\nThe twins were joined at the abdomen. Gracie was described as bright and\nalert with an anatomically normal brain, heart, lungs, and liver. Rosie, on\nthe other hand, had significant brain pathology and relied on Gracie’s\nheart and lungs for her blood supply. Separating the twins would mean the\ncertain death of Rosie, but Gracie had a good chance of survival with\n178 Part 2 Ethical Principles in Medical Ethics\n\nmoderate physical impairment that would require further operations to\ncorrect. Without intervention to separate the twins, they would both die\nwithin three to six months.\n\nThe parents, Roman Catholics, said they wanted “God's will” to pre-\nvail and refused permission for the operation. They could not accept the\nidea of killing one by cutting off her blood supply in order for the other to\nsurvive. They were willing to accept the death of both, if necessary, but\nfound intentional action that would end one of the lives to save the other\nunacceptable. While the main focus of their reported objection was the\nmoral problem of sacrificing one for the benefit of the other, they were also\nquoted as expressing concern that neither they nor their home country\nwould be able to provide the special care that Gracie would require. If\nmedical treatment necessary to preserve life was “gravely burdensome” to\nthe patient or others, Roman Catholicism has long recognized the legiti-\nmacy of forgoing life support.\n\nThe doctors at St. Mary’s Hospital sought court authorization to per-\nform the procedure against the parents’ wishes, and the courts ultimately\ngranted that request. The lower court attempted to claim that the operation\nthat would lead to Rosie’s death was not a case of killing, but rather the\nwithdrawal of nutrition and hydration by clamping off her blood supply. It\nwas deemed “passive” euthanasia rather than active killing. The court ac-\nknowledged that the physicians felt they had a medical moral duty to pre-\nserve the life that could be preserved and their “collective medical\nconscience” would suffer if not authorized to proceed. When the parents\nappealed the lower court decision, the appeals court justices gave differ-\ning arguments but affirmed the right of the doctors to proceed. One ap-\npeals court judge rejected the claim that cutting off the blood supply was\nan omission of treatment rather than active killing. He argued that it cannot\nbe claimed that the procedure was in Rosie's best interest. Nevertheless, he\nendorsed it, claiming that Rosie could be viewed as killing Gracie by her\nattachment to Gracie’s blood supply. The action was thus labeled “self-\ndefense” from Gracie’s perspective.\n\nA second appeals court justice framed his support of the intervention\nin what he called the “doctrine of necessity.” He cited an analogy to a\nmountain climber justified in cutting the rope binding him to a companion\nwho had fallen when, unless he frees himself, both will die.\n\nThe third justice concluded that remaining conjoined to Gracie would\nbe of no benefit to Rosie and would actually be to her disadvantage. He\nclaimed that the doctors’ duties to Gracie and Rosie were in conflict. He\nnotes that the intent of the doctors was not to kill Rosie, but to give each\ntwin “bodily integrity” and that such independent existence was in the in-\nChapter 9 Avoidance of Killing 179\n\nterest of each. He cited the conclusion of the physicians, stating that “Highly\nskilled and conscientious doctors believe that the best course, in the\ninterests of both twins, is to undertake elective surgery in order to separate\nthem and save Gracie.”\n\nThe procedure was performed on November 7, 2000. Rosie died imme-\ndiately when her blood vessels were cut. Gracie continued to survive with\nthe expectation that she would need years of surgical care. At last report,\nshe was alive and apparently doing well over a decade later.",

She had long suffered from organic brain syndrome and had been le-\ngally incompetent since 1979. She was a resident at Parklane Nursing Home\nin Bloomfield, NJ. Her nephew, Thomas Whittemore, was her only living\nrelative and her guardian. In July of 1982, her left foot was gangrenous and\namputation was recommended. Mr. Whittemore refused consent for the am-\nputation, claiming that Miss Conroy has always resisted medical involve-\nment. It is testimony to the evolution of the right of patients and their\nsurrogates to refuse medical treatment in the days since Karen Quinlan\nthat Mr. Whittemore’s right to refuse on these grounds was not challenged\nlegally even though the gangrene was a serious, possibly life-threatening\ncondition. While she was hospitalized in conjunction with the treatment of\nthe gangrene, medical personnel noticed that Miss Conroy was not receiv-\ning adequate nourishment and placed a naso-gastric (NG) tube to provide\nbetter nutrition. By 1983, when the case became public, she was totally de-\npendent on the tube for feeding.\n\nMiss Conroy had many other medical problems. In addition to the\nsevere organic brain syndrome, she had necrotic decubitus ulcers on her\nleft foot, leg, and hip, a urinary tract infection, hypertension, arterioscle-\nrotic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus and was unable to move except\nfor minor movements of her head, neck, and arms. She did not speak. She\nlay in a fetal position, only sometimes followed people with her eyes, and\nher general physical appearance was very withered. She moaned when\nmoved or touched. It was unclear whether she was capable of experiencing\nnpain. She showed no signs of cognitive or volitional functioning.\n\nUsing reasoning similar to that in defending the refusal of the amputa-\ntion, Mr. Whittemore now insisted that the NG tube be removed.\n\nThe doctors were reluctant to go along. They accepted the legitimacy of\nrefusing ventilators or amputations but considered provision of food and\nfluids as basic medical care, something they expected to provide to all\n182 | Part2 Ethical Principles in Medical Ethics\n\npatients who needed them.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nIs withdrawing artificial nutrition and hydration morally different than other\ntypes of life-sustaining treatment? Why or why not?\nMr. Whittemore reasoned that Ms. Conroy “always resisted medical involve-\nment” to argue for removal of the NG tube.

She suffered cardiac arrest\nresulting in massive brain damage before she was stabilized at the hospi-\ntal. At the time a potassium imbalance was noted. Terri had a history of\ndieting, and some suspected that her medical crisis was triggered by her\neating behavior, but the actual cause was never determined. Although\nsome later suggested abuse, no evidence related to abuse was ever\nuncovered.\n\nIn June of 1990, Michael was appointed as her legal guardian. He made\nefforts to find treatments that might restore normal brain function, even\ntaking Terri to California for experimental brain stimulator treatment and\na thalamic stimulator implant. These efforts proved unsuccessful, and\nTerri was left severely compromised.\n\nIn 1992, Michael won a malpractice award resulting from claims re-\nlated to inadequate treatment when she was first treated. A trust fund for\nTerri's care amounting to $750,000 and damages for Michael of $300,000\nwas established as a result. Perhaps related to disputes over the money\nand differences over Terri's treatment, Michael and his in-laws had a fall-\ning out.\n\nBy 1998 the tensions had crystallized, focusing on whether it was ap-\npropriate to continue medically supplied nutrition and hydration for Terri.\nIn May of that year, Michael petitioned the court to remove the feeding\ntube. Terri‘s parents opposed this action. This was only the first of many\ncourt reviews addressing the decision to forgo the feeding tube.\n\nThe court battles dealt with the question of whether Terri was in a\npersistent vegetative state (PVS) and therefore by this time presumably per-\nmanently unconscious and, if so, whether she would want the tube\nremoved.\n\nBy the year 2000 the court had reviewed the findings of experts in neu-\nrology and had determined that Terri was indeed in PVS, thus agreeing\nwith the majority of the experts. At this and other court reviews, two court-\nappointed temporary guardians also concurred with that finding. The court\nalso concluded that Terri would want the feeding tube removed under\nthese conditions.\n\nDuring this time, Terri's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, disputed the\nfindings both about Terri’s wishes and about her mental state. They testi-\nfied that she had not ever expressed wishes to forgo medically supplied\nChapter 9 Avoidance of Killing 185\n\nnutrition, thus contradicting testimony of Michael, his brother, and his sister-\nin-law. They also insisted that she appeared to respond to them. Their views\nwere supported by one physician who concurred in their judgment that she\nappeared aware of them at times. Nevertheless, after reviewing the evi-\ndence, the courts and the guardians all concluded she would not want the\nfeeding tube under her present circumstances. ]\n\nAfter many appeals in both state and federal courts and attempted\ninterventions by the U.S. Congress and President GeorgeW . Bush, the orig-\ninal ruling authorizing the withholding of the feeding tube was sustained.\nIt was removed for the final time on March 18, 2005. Terri died on March 31.\nThe Schindlers continue to insist that she was not vegetative, had not ex-\npressed a desire to have the tube removed, and should not have had it\nremoved.",

    "case": "Case 9-6\nAssisted Suicide, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Depression\nKathleen Rheel was a 56-year-old, married, former schoolteacher in the\nOregon public schools who had retired from teaching five years previously\nbecause the daily grind had become too much for her. She had two years\nbefore been diagnosed by Michael Carver, her internist, as showing the\nChapter 9 Avoidance of Killing 187\n\ninitial signs of Alzheimer's disease. She and her husband had never had\nchildren. She believed her friends had not realized her situation, but she\nhad noticed an increasing inability to remember names, and her husband\ndetected that she was forgetting birthdays and appointments. She feared\nher symptoms were getting worse. She and her husband had discussed a\nplan to hire a housekeeper, anticipating the time when she would not be\nable to be left by herself. She had become increasingly distressed at these\nprospects. She wanted nothing to do with outside caregivers and did not\nwant to be responsible for depleting the family’s meager assets. She had\nalways been a lover of knowledge. She read constantly, and she and her\nhusband enjoyed attending adult education classes and local theater. She\nhated the thought of a life without these basic pleasures. Her life was grad-\nually becoming unbearable.\n\nMs. Rheel was horrified at the prospect of a gradual decline in her\nmental abilities and the economic impact on her husband if she would\nneed care for a prolonged period. She explored the prognosis with\nDr. Carver, who indicated that he thought the disease was progressing but\nthat she would be quite capable of managing her own affairs and enjoying\nlife for some years to come.\n\nDuring one of her appointments with Dr. Carver, she asked about the\nterms of the Oregon law that permits physicians to assist in the suicide of\nterminally ill patients. Dr. Carver was reluctant to discuss it. He had origi-\nnally been opposed to the law, believing that the physician’s task is to pro-\nmote health rather than cause the deaths of patients. Gradually, however,\nhe had become convinced that some patients suffered terribly in spite of\nreceiving the best medical care available. He believed in hospice care but\nrealized that some patients, such as Ms. Rheel, were not candidates. Her\nsuffering was not physical. Even high-quality psychiatric and social work\ncare were not going to address her increasing misery.\n\nDr. Carver knew that the Oregon assisted suicide law applied only to\npatients who were 18 years of age, capable of making and communicating\ntheir own health care decisions, and had a terminal illness that would lead\nto death within six months. He explained that Ms. Rheel would not qualify\nsince, although the Alzheimer's disease would likely eventually be related\nto her death, she did not have a terminal illness that would lead to death\nwithin six months.\n\nOver the course of the next year, Ms. Rheel’s condition worsened some-\nwhat. Her depression became more pronounced, although in Dr. Carver's\nopinion she was clearly still mentally competent. At an appointment with\nDr. Carver, she pressed more aggressively. She informed him that she had\ndecided that she did not want to live with her deteriorating condition. She\nand her husband had made all arrangements; her will had been reviewed,\nshe had begun giving some of her possessions to friends and relatives, and\n188 |\nPart 2 Ethical Principles in Medical Ethics\n\nshe was now serious about discussing Dr. Carver's assistance. Dr. Carver\nstrongly urged her to accept a referral to a psychiatrist, but she declined.\nThis continued for three additional appointments. It was clear to\nDr. Carver that she was increasingly committed to ending her life. She had\nclearly thought through the decision carefully and would likely choose\nnonmedical means if he did not cooperate. He was concerned that the\nOregon law would not condone his prescribing of a lethal agent, since his\npatient was not terminal according to the terms of the law. He reasoned,\nhowever, that, as she became increasingly suicidal without the hope of\npsychiatric care, she, in fact, would commit suicide within the next six\nmonths. He knew that the Oregon law left it up to the physician to deter-\nmine whether the six-month criterion had been met. Fearing the bad conse-\nquences of her suicide using nonmedical means, he seriously explored\nwhether to write a prescription for barbiturates that would, with medical\nsupervision, lead to her death. If he determined she met the terms of the\nlaw and remained mentally competent, he believed he could, with reluc-\nance, write the prescription. Ms. Rheel died with her husband and\nDr. Carver at her side. Her death was reported under the terms of the law.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nDid Dr. Carver correctly interpret the Oregon law on assisted suicide?\n.| Did Dr. Carver make the right decision in Ms. Rheel’s case?",

The results of a routine preg-\nnancy test revealed that, in spite of her great efforts to avoid it, she had con-\nceived and was then seven-and-a-half weeks pregnant. The pulmonologist\ncounseled her that her safest course of action was to end the pregnancy,\nsince in the best case, pregnancy with pulmonary hypertension carries a\n10-15 percent risk of mortality for a pregnant woman trying to carry to term,\nand because of the severity of her disease her own prospects were closer to\n90-50.

It had taken his father's life\nwhen he was an adolescent. Mr. Merrik had been diagnosed in time to have\nhis colon removed. Now he and his wife, Barbara, age 32, were planning on\nhaving their first child. They had been told by their internist and by a ge-\nnetic counselor that HNPCC results from a genetic mutation that is inher-\nited in an autosomal dominant fashion.!! This meant that, for anyone who\nhad the mutation, each of his offspring had a 50 percent chance that each\n| 227\nChapter 11 Genetics, Birth, and the Biological Revolution\nof his children would also have it. For that reason and because Mr. Merrik\nhad been under medical treatment, he and his wife had hesitated to have\nchildren. They had decided that, if they could not be assured that their chil-\ndren would be free of the mutation causing the cancer, they would remain\nchildless.\nThey were now told that tests with great accuracy could be performed\nthat would tell them if any conception carried the gene. They had two op-\ntions for testing. They could undergo IVF and have the resulting embryos\ntested using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). At about three days\nafter fertilization a single cell would be removed and tested for the pres-\nence of the mutation. At that point, they could choose, from among the em-\nryos free of the mutation, a number to be implanted. Since not all implanted\nembryos would develop, typically two or three would be implanted hoping\nthat at least one would survive to birth.\nThe Merriks were aware that it was a challenging and expensive\noption. Mrs. Merrik would have to be treated to make egg cells available\nthat could be procured and fertilized with her husband's sperm. The cost\ncould be upward of $25,000 that their insurance would not cover, depend-\ning on the number of cycles involved. They would face the daunting task of\nselecting from the embryos that would be chosen to survive, a task Mrs.\nMerrik thought would be like “playing God.” Remaining healthy embryos\nas well as any with the HNPCC genetic mutation would be discarded\nunless they chose to freeze them for future implantation or to donate them\nto another couple who was infertile or for research. They had moral doubts\nabout all these options.\nTheir second option for having a child that was genetically their own\nwould be to conceive naturally and then have the fetus tested prenatally\nfor the presence of the mutation. They would have to wait for eleven to\ntwelve weeks for testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or at least four-\nteen weeks to have amniocentisis in which amniotic fluid would be with-\ndrawn to have fetal cells recovered and tested.

For those\n228 Part 3 Special Problem Areas\ndeveloping the cancer, death will result without treatment, but removal of\nthe colon and perhaps the rectum could provide a good chance of survival.\nThis could result in the need for a colostomy, but the gene did not mean a\ncertain death from this kind of cancer. The risk for other cancers would\nremain, just as in any other person.\nThey had the additional options of waiting io test the offspring postno-\ntally, perhaps waiting until the child had matured to the point that he or\nshe could decide about when to test, or having a child that was not carry-\ning Mr. Merrik’s genes—either through adoption or artificial insemination.\nWas prenatal testing through PGD or amniocentesis acceptable, and, if so,\nwas one of them morally preferable?\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n2 Make a list of the various options facing the Merriks and the harms and ben-\nefits for each option.

Mrs. Harrelson, who was pregnant for the first\ntime, was three months into an apparently normal pregnancy. She and her\nhusband were both achondroplastic dwarfs. They seemingly were finan-\ncially comfortable and well adjusted to their physical conditions. They had\nrequested testing of their developing fetus for evidence of achondroplasia.\nAchondroplastic dwarfism is a bone growth disorder in which carti-\nlage is not properly converted into bone. Adult males develop to an average\nheight of about four feet, four inches; females average about three inches\nshorter. While trunk size is normal, arms and legs are short and the head is\nenlarged, featuring a prominent forehead. Intelligence is generally normal.\nPhysical problems include bouts of apnea (periods in which breathing\nstops), obesity, bowed legs, and abnormalities of the lower back. Back pain\nis common in older people with the condition.\nThe condition results from a mutation in a single gene, the FGFR3\n(fibroblast growth factor 3) gene. It occurs once in every 15,000 to 40,000\nbirths, but if both parents have the gene, one child in four will inherit two\ncopies, which results in severe effects, usually stillbirth or death from re-\nspiratory failure soon after birth. One child in four will not inherit any copies\n230 |\nPart 3 Special Problem Areas\nand will not be affected. Two in four will inherit one copy and have dwart-\nism, the same characteristics as their parents.\nPrenatal diagnosis for the presence of the abnormal gene is now pos-\nsible. Since incidence is so rare, if neither parent has the condition, testing\nwould not normally be carried out. If both parents are affected, then testing\nwould become more plausible. Any fetus with two copies of the gene could\nbe aborted.\nDr. Whistler was discussing the diagnostic procedure with Mr. and\nMrs. Harrelson and helping them understand their options. It became ap-\nparent to her that their intention was to abort not only any fetus with two\ncopies of the gene but also any child with no copies. If the fetus was not\nachondroplastic, they would have the pregnancy aborted because they did\nnot want to rear a child obviously different from themselves.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nWhat is your initial reaction to the Harrelsons’ decision about future\noffspring?\nWhat value judgments underlie your reactions?\nWhat ethical arguments might the Harrelsons offer to justify their desire to\nhave a child like themselves?",

    "case": "Case 11-3\nSickle Cell and Black Genocide\nWilbur Johnson and Mae Sanford, both African American, had met while\nworking on a community action project in a large Eastern city. After going\ntogether for a year, they decided to get married and have a family.\nMr. Johnson's physician, Lester Kettering, asked if Mr. Johnson knew\nhis sickle cell status and explained that if both he and his future wife were\ncarriers, they had one chance in four that any child born to them would\nhave the disease. He further explained that they would also have two\nchances in four that a child would be a carrier, while in one of four births\nthe offspring would carry no copies of the gene. Dr. Kettering also explained\nthat it was state law that any children born would be routinely tested for\nsickle cell status, unless the parents registered their objection.\nThe disease itself is an inherited abnormality in the structure of hemo-\nglobin, which at a minimum almost always severely handicaps its victims.\nLife expectancy now, as a result of better treatment, has increased, but aver-\nage age of death is still in the forties. Sickle cell disease is autosomal reces-\nsive; that is, both parents must have at least one copy of the gene before\nthere is a risk of producing children with the disease (homozygotes). When\nboth parents are carriers, the risk of bearing such a child is 25 percent with\neach pregnancy. Carriers themselves are almost symptomless and may\nhave no idea of their status unless they are screened.\nMr. Johnson's younger brother died in adolescence from the disease,\nafter many painful and debilitating attacks. He thus knew something about\nit, including the fact that there was a good possibility that he himself was a\n| 233\nChapter 11 Genetics, Birth, and the Biological Revolution\ncarrier. Mr. Johnson also knew that the trait is fairly common among African\nAmericans, about one in twelve of them being a carrier, so that there was a\ngood chance his fiancée was a carrier too. Ms. Sanford knows of no sickle\n| 234 |\nPart 3 Special Problem Areas\ncell disease in her immediate family, but she is in a racial group with a rela-\ntively high rate of carriers.\nMr. Johnson understands that, if both he and his future wife are carri-\ners, they will face additional choices. Prenatal diagnosis is now available\nthat will accurately determine if a fetus has sickle cell disease. The only\nintervention other than counseling available at that point, however, is the\ntermination of the pregnancy. Their other option would be to continue\nthe pregnancy until delivery, at which time routine testing will determine\nthe sickle cell status. If the infant has the disease (i.e., two copies of the\ngene), treatment regimens are now considered sufficiently effective that\nidentification of infants with the disease is mandated. For example, infec-\ntions need to be suppressed using antibiotics.\nThus, two prospective parents who know they both are carriers have\nfour options: they can risk a 25 percent chance of having a child with the\ndisease itself with each pregnancy, living with the attendant anxiety; they\ncan undergo prenatal diagnosis and abort affected fetuses; they can resort\nto artificial insemination with a noncarrier donor; or they can forgo child-\nbearing altogether, perhaps adopting if the short supply of adoptable\nbabies permits.\nMr. Johnson found each of these alternatives infuriatingly unaccept-\nable. He feared that the offer of premarital screening of African American\nfor the sickle cell trait, which is not a clinical condition and about which\nnothing can be done, was just another government attempt to cripple black\nreproductive capability. In the context of black history, he viewed it as an\nattempt by white society to control his fecundity in the beneficent guise of\nproviding medical options. All of their options seemed to inhibit childbear-\ning either because they would limit births (abortion and forgoing children\naltogether) or because they were expensive (prenatal testing or artificial\ninsemination). The choices were all unattractive and would inhibit his and\nhis wife's normal family development. Since the information would pro-\nduce anxiety and would inhibit childbearing, he came to doubt that screen-\ning for carrier status was defensible. He was also annoyed that while the\nstate rushed in to mandate screening of newborns—screening that might\nsuggest that African Americans should have no children—it paid little at-\ntention to the need for counseling connected with screening that would\nhelp those identified as having a sickle cell trait to understand their situa-\ntion and the alternatives for having children. He was more disturbed that,\nwhile the state mandated testing, it did not mandate health insurance that\nwould be necessary to cover the costs of intervention if their child turned\nout to have sickle cell.\nMs. Sanford did not feel so strongly, but she agreed that there was a\ndanger whenever the state mandated screening for a disease that primar-\nily affected African American families.",

In 1984, Mary Beth responded to an adver-\ntisement placed in a local newspaper asking for women who would like to\nhelp couples who are unable to have children themselves. Ms. Whitehead\nwas matched up by the New York-based Infertility Center with Elizabeth\nand William Stern. The Sterns, who also lived in New Jersey, wanted very\nbadly to have a child of their own. Mrs. Stern had multiple sclerosis and had\nbeen advised that pregnancy could be medically dangerous for her. The\nSterns and Ms. Whitehead signed a contract that stipulated that Mary Beth\nWhitehead would be artificially inseminated with William Stern’s sperm\nand that, after the birth of the resulting child, the Sterns would obtain cus-\ntody and parental rights while Ms. Whitehead would be paid $10,000 in\ncompensation.\nThe Sterns and the Whiteheads remained on relatively good terms\nthroughout the pregnancy. However, shortly before she was due to give\nbirth, Ms. Whitehead began to have serious doubts about the agreement. In\nher own words, she began “to resent the idea that [Elizabeth Stern] had\nrented my body to produce a child.”\nOn March 27, 1986, Mary Beth Whitehead gave birth to a baby girl. She\nimmediately began to bond with the child and named her Sara. The Sterns\nwere equally thrilled to see the healthy baby at the hospital and named\nher Melissa.\nSeveral days later, when Ms. Whitehead and Sara/Melissa were ready\nto leave the hospital, the Sterns took Sara/Melissa home with them. Mary\nBeth Whitehead went home that night in great emotional distress and de-\ncided that she wanted Sara back. She went the next day to the Sterns and\nasked if she could take Sara/Melissa for a week to have some time with her.\nThe Sterns agreed and Sara/Melissa went home with Ms. Whitehead.\nA little over a week later, the Sterns came to collect the baby but Mary Beth\nand Rick Whitehead had decided that they were going to keep Sara perma-\nnently. Elizabeth Stern demanded the child, and William Stern broke into\ntears. Finally, they left Melissa with the Whiteheads.\nA month later, the Sterns returned to the Whitehead house with a court\norder and police in tow. The police demanded that the Whiteheads hand\nover Melissa Stern, but they replied that the only baby in the house was\nnamed Sara Whitehead. There was some confusion during which the White-\nheads conferred with each other and decided that they should make a run for\nit. Rick Whitehead sneaked out of the house with Sara. The next day, the\nentire Whitehead family and Sara/Melissa fled to Ms. Whitehead’s parents’\nhouse in Florida. Soon after, the police found them and took Melissa back to\nthe Sterns. The battle for Sara/Melissa now moved from the homes of the two\nfamilies to the courtrooms of New Jersey.\nThe Sterns wanted to ensure that they had permanent custody of\nMelissa so they initiated a court hearing. The Whiteheads challenged\nthem, claiming that the baby should be brought up by her biological\nmother. The court called Sara/Melissa “Baby M” since neither Sara nor\nMelissa was acceptable to both parties. The trial went on for months and\nwas subject to enormous media coverage. On March 31, 1987, exactly one\nyear after Ms. Whitehead left the hospital and first parted with her baby,\nJudge Harvey Sorkow issued a ruling that granted the Sterns custody of\nBaby M and allowed Elizabeth Stern to legally adopt Baby M. This ruling\namounted to a legal statement that Ms. Whitehead was not the mother of\nBaby M.\nThe Whiteheads appealed the court's ruling to the New Jersey Supreme\nCourt. On February 3, 1988, the court ruled that although the Sterns should\nmaintain custody of Baby M, Mary Beth's parental rights cannot be termi-\nnated. The Supreme Court held that the surrogacy contract between\nMs. Whitehead and the Sterns was not legally binding because a biologi-\ncal mother can only consent to give a child up for adoption after the child is\nborn. This ruling allowed Mary Beth Whitehead the legal possibility of pa-\nrental visitation rights.”°\nBaby M went by the name Melissa Stern. When she turned 18 several\nyears ago, she chose to formally adopt Elizabeth Stern as her mother. She\nbecame a successful university student, studied at King’s College, London,\n- and wrote a dissertation on “Reviving Solomon: Modern Day Questions Re-\ngarding the Long-term Implications for the Children of Surrogacy Arrange-\nments.”2! She remarked to one journalist that it was very strange to have to\nstudy her own case in an ethics class.”\n|| 237\nChapter 11 Genetics, Birth, and the Biological Revolution\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nDo the various ethical problems that arose in the case of Baby M make a com-\npelling argument against legalizing surrogate motherhood?

She had\nhad two previous brain operations, the most recent of which involved the\nremoval of her entire right temporal lobe. She had also undergone three\nrounds of chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and an experimental mono-\nclonal antibody treatment. All failed to improve her situation. Her doctors\ngave her just weeks to live.\nDr. Ivor Royston of the San Diego Regional Cancer Center asked the NIH\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee for a “compassionate waiver” that\nwould allow him to treat this woman with an unapproved, experimental gene\ntherapy. A compassionate use waiver would permit the use of an experimen-\ntal agent outside the normal research protocol and approval process.\nDr. Royston’'s plan was to inject the woman with her own cells altered\ngenetically to contain interleukin 2 in an attempt to stimulate the woman's\nimmune response to the cancer. This would require that the woman be in-\njected with the cells in progressively larger doses every two weeks.\nAt the time of the proposal to treat this woman, the United States gov-\nernment had a Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which had to\nreview and approve all therapeutic use of gene therapy involving recombi-\nnation of genetic DNA. It had not reviewed this procedure.\nRoyston and the woman's husband had obtained a review from the Food\nand Drug Administration. It concluded that the therapy was, in all likeli-\nhood, not harmful. There was, however, no evidence that the therapy would\nbe effective. It had not been proven effective on animals and had never\nbefore been attempted in humans. :\nIn an ideal world in which a patient had time to wait for the orderly de-\nvelopment of a new drug or biological product, a patient would wait for test-\ning in nonhuman animals as well as humans.

Senator Harkin wrote to Healy request-\ning that she create guidelines for expedited hearings in special cases.\nDr. Healy denied Senator Harkin’s request, stating that there was simply\nnot enough information available on this therapy to justify its use, even as\na compassionate exemption.

The Committee members speculated about Senator Harkin’'s\nrole in the decision, noting that he heads the Senate subcommittee on ap-\npropriations, which allocates funds for the NIH.

She had been seeing psychiatrist Gilbert DeVita now for a month,\nattempting to resolve intense feelings of guilt related to her persistent sui-\ncidal thoughts. She acknowledged to Dr. DeVita that for the past two years\nshe had had thoughts of ending her life. She had developed deep feelings\nChapter 12 Mental Health and Behavior Control 251\n\nthat included her more and more firm resolve to commit suicide, but si-\nmultaneously felt very guilty that she would be abandoning her respon-\nsibilities to her family and her community were she to do so.\nDr. DeVita had learned over the course of the four sessions he had\nhad with her that she was married to a Caucasian American with a history\nof alcoholism and abuse of his wife. Most of the abuse was mental. He criti-\nzed her constantly, complaining about the way she kept house and prepared\nmeals. Dr. DeVita had gotten her to reveal that, on at least two occasions,\nhe had struck her; once, a year ago, it had resulted in a trip to the hospital\nemergency room. That was the most recent physical attack that Dr. DeVita\nwas able to elicit from Ms. Wong.\nOver the years Ms. Wong had studied the history of Chinese thought\nand the culture of her parents who had immigrated from China when\nMs. Wong was a child. This Chinese cultural history, with its Confucian\ninfluences, was the closest thing Ms. Wong had to a religion. From it she\nhad come to understand that those in her heritage had sometimes chosen\nsuicide as a way to end a difficult life situation. She had decided that\nher marriage was hopeless and that ending her life was her way out. At\nthe same time, from her American culture she had absorbed the idea that\nsuicide was immoral and was in her words, “running away from the\nproblem.”\nDr. DeVita sympathized with Ms. Wong's plight, but had real doubts\nabout the wisdom of her chosen course. He was in a difficult position if\nshe was asking him to help her overcome her guilt in order to free herself\nfrom the constraints that would help her pursue the course she had chosen.\nAt the same time, he was not sure what his role should be. He knew that\nspousal abuse could be reported, but Ms. Wong pleaded that he not dis-\nclose those problems. The physical aspects of the abuse had ceased, at\nleast for the time being, and the mental cruelty was, in her view, not some-\nthing she wanted to address. Dr. DeVita offered to begin a course of therapy\nto overcome what he took to be a depression related to her feeling of hope-\nlessness in her marriage. She asked some questions, as if she were inter-\nested in that approach, but then quickly said that that was not what she\nwanted.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould Dr. DeVita attempt to treat her depression, perhaps having Ms. Wong\ncommitted as dangerous to herself?\nShould he report the abuse and attempt to have her husband confronted?\nShould he help Ms. Wong overcome her guilt as she is asking?

He has been employed at the\nsame job as a professional accountant for three decades and plans on retir-\ning within the next year. He is in good health except that he is 5’9” tall and\nweighs 240 pounds. That makes his body mass index (BMI) 35.4 and makes\nhim obese according to the National Institutes of Health. According to the\nnewly revised American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual 5 (DSM-5) he has the disease of obesity.\nHe sees his internist, Dr. McCubbin, at his health maintenance organi-\nzation (HMO) yearly, and once again this year Dr. McCubbin points out his\nweight and urges him to follow a better diet and get more exercise.

He\nhas gout, but no other significant medical issues. He has never smoked and\nwalks a mile a day at least five days a week.\nMr. Braddock's weight has been stable for over 20 years. The continual\nexpressions of concern about his weight from his internist and his wife have\nled him to pay attention to the literature on obesity. He knows that higher\nBMI levels generally correlate with mortality and morbidity risks. He found\na publication referring to the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) for the year 2000 that estimated 111,909 excess deaths\nfrom obesity (BMI greater than 30).!’ On the other hand, he found tremen-\ndous variation in the articles he had read. Particularly with older patients,\nthe correlations seem variable. For example, in one article he read, for\nblack subjects, death risk actually was lower for people in the BMI range\nof 25-28 than it was for those in the 23.5-24.9 range. Moreover, even\nthough death risk increased at higher BMI ranges, even in the highest\ngroup the difference was not statistically significant.© Thus, even though\nthere were detrimental effects at the highest BMI ranges, the time lost\nfrom obesity was small for older persons, measured in months or, at\nmost, a year or two, and for older blacks higher BMI actually produced a\ngain in years of life.”\nMrz.

For two years the patient had experienced increasing trouble\nwith the technical aspects of his work. More recently he had been talking\nabout his brother, George, as if he were alive although he had died six\nyears earlier. He identified his own age as 48 and the year as \"1994... er,\nno, 2000.” Examination revealed that the patient walked with a wide-based\ngait, a standard sign of brain pathology, and had a decreased cerebral\nfunction but was otherwise normal. The patient had no difficulty with\nsimple coin problems and could repeat six digits.\nPleading pressing business, the patient declined hospitalization to deter-\nmine the cause of his decreasing cerebral function. His wife tried to persuade\nhim to enter the hospital, but when the physician suggested that she might\nassume guardianship of her husband through court action, she declined.\nSix months later, the patient’s condition had worsened. Through the\nurging of the county agent, the patient had leased most of his farmland to\nhis neighbors and now did no farm work. His gait had become so wide-\nbased that acquaintances mistakenly thought him inebriated. He urinated\nin his pants about once a week but seemed not to care. He sat watching\ntelevision all day but paid no attention to the program content.\nA medical examination showed an apparently alert man without\nspeech difficulty but with considerable mental deterioration. This time the\npatient gave his age as 38, the year as 1973, the president as Clinton, and\nthe location as a drugstore in his home town. He failed to recognize the\nname George W. Bush, but upon hearing the name Dick Cheney, he sponta-\nneously volunteered an opinion on the war in Iraq. The patient could not\nsubtract 20 cents from a dollar but could name the number of nickels in a\nquarter. He could recite the months of the year and could, upon request\nfrom his wife, give fairly long quotations from the Bible.\nThe resident and the attending physician urged hospitalization. They\ntold the patient that they could evaluate him for treatable causes of\nmental deterioration and memory deficit. In view of his wide-based gait\nand urinary incontinence in association with dementia, it was likely he\nhad occult hydrocephalus. It was explained to the couple that this disorder\ncauses decreased mental abilities by interference with the absorption of\ncerebrospinal fluid. The mental deterioration in such patients is partially\nreversible, as in his case at the present time, or completely reversible, as\nwas his case six months ago when first seen. The treatment was to place a\nplastic tube through the skull to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the\nbrain to the vascular system, which was explained to the patient with dia-\ngrams. The patient immediately rejected the operation, summarizing his\nthoughts with the words, “Ain't nobody gonna cut on my head.”\nThe patient's wife again attempted to persuade the patient to accept\nhospitalization and, if tests confirmed the clinical impression, an opera-\ntion. The attending physician argued to the wife that the patient did not\nhave the mental competence to decide his own fate and that the wife should\nbecome the patient's legal guardian through court action and force his\nhospitalization. The wife politely but vigorously rejected this course of\naction, pointing out that, in her family, the husband made all important\ndecisions. In addition, she expressed horror at forcing this kind of invasive\nprocedure on her husband.\nThe resident and the attending physician differed in opinions at this\npoint. The resident thought the patient should be followed in the outpatient\nclinic until he perhaps changed his mind. The resident pointed out that\nthough the patient had decreased mental abilities, he still retained enough\nintelligence to decide his own fate. The attending physician wished for\ncourt action to make the patient the ward of one of his relatives or, if neces-\nsary, the temporary ward of the hospital and forcing hospitalization and\ntherapy.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nOf the two clinicians, the resident and the attending physician, which view do\nyou find most compelling regarding Mr. Williams's treatment and why?\n. What ethical principles underlie the views of the resident and attending\nphysician?",

Through the Internet he met Sandi Sabloff, who needed a kidney\ntransplant. One of her kidneys had failed completely and the second was\nfailing as well. Legal complications prevented him from making the gift in\nAustralia so he traveled to Toronto, Canada.\nPrior to coming to Canada, he had been interviewed by telephone by a\ncommittee. It included a psychiatrist, a social worker, and a bioethicist. On\nMarch 19, 2007, he arrived at Toronto General Hospital where the organ\nprocurement was planned. He had further evaluation including meetings\nwith the committee and medical compatibility testing. Following the\nscreening, the hospital sent a letter to Ms. Sabloff indicating the transplant\nwould occur on April 30.\nSome days later, the hospital began reassessing its decision.\nMr. Falkingham’s mother and stepfather, Kate and Nick Croft, had urged\nthe hospital to review the case further. They claimed he had been unduly\npressured into donating by the religious group, the Jesus Christians. It isa\ngroup that believes it should act on its Christian faith by donating a kidney\nto a stranger as an act of kindness. About half of the thirty members of the\ngroup have donated, including its leader David McKay who had donated\none of his kidneys at the Mayo Clinic in 2003.\nMr. Falkingham'\"s stepfather was quoted by the National Post newspa-\nper as saying, “I’m certain that the pressure to donate a kidney is one of the\nmany pressures involved in being a member of this group. ... Iw ould say it’s\nacult. Iw ould say it's a sect. I would say it’s a madness.”” They claimed that\nthe group coerced members into giving kidneys as a way of gaining public-\nity. Meanwhile, the group claims it is their way of expressing spiritual devo-\ntion and Christian charity. Mr. Falkingham said he was sent to a forensic\npsychiatrist with a specialty related to brainwashing and undue influence.\nAfter some five weeks of waiting, the hospital announced that it was can-\nceling the operation. Robert Bell, the CEO of University Health Network, the\nparent of Toronto General, was quoted by the Toronto-based Globe and Mail\nnewspaper as saying, “We need to make sure the [donor] has informed con-\nsent for what this is all about, without any evidence of coercion and without\nany evidence of value consideration being given to the donation of the tissue.””°\nIs it appropriate for a health professional, a psychiatrist, social worker,\nor a bioethicist to block an altruistic action by an adult on grounds that he\nis being coerced or brainwashed?",

    "case": "Case 12-5\nA Kidney to Turn a Life Around\nAdam Taylor, age 33, had lived a tough life. He started drinking in high\nschool and was an alcoholic by the time he was 21. His marriage failed\nafter two years. His wife won custody of his two children and now will not\nlet him see them. He had been employed with various construction firms,\nbut his alcoholism had cost him those well-paying jobs.\nAfter a decade lost in the haze of drugs and alcohol, he entered a\ntreatment program at age 31. It began with a four-week inpatient program\nfollowed by intensive group, outpatient therapy. He had now been sober\nfor eighteen months. He had joined the church of his girlfriend and was\nworking steadily at a local fast-food restaurant. His life was beginning to\nimprove.\nMr. Taylor read in the local newspaper that the organ procurement\norganization (OPO) was accepting, on a trial basis, people who wanted\nto altruistically donate a kidney to a stranger. No one was actively re-\ncruited for the program, but the OPO would accept donor-initiated re-\nquests. Following a rigorous work-up, those who passed the medical\nand psychiatric screen would enter a hospital in the area to have a\nkidney removed. Those who called the OPO were told that the removal\nof the kidney was a major operation that would require about a week's\nhospitalization followed by a month's recovery. Healthy people should\nbe able to function well for the rest of their lives with one kidney. The\nprocedure is the same one now used routinely by family members who\ndonate a kidney to a loved one. The only difference in the case of an\naltruistic donor to a stranger is that the kidney, once procured, would be\nallocated according to the standard algorithm for organs procured from\nnewly deceased donors.\nMr. Taylor passed the medical screen. There was no sign of infectious\ndisease related to his history of drug use. His psychiatric evaluation was\nconducted by Ann Buchanan, who was under contract with the OPO for\nsuch evaluations. She had to certify that the potential donor was mentally\nable to give an adequate consent to the donation and was not under undue\ninfluence. Dr. Buchanan spent more than the usual amount of time with\nMr. Taylor because of his medical and lifestyle history. She came to believe\nthat Mr. Taylor wished to donate a kidney as a symbol that he was leading\na new life, that he had turned his life around. No doubt, he had serious\nproblems in the past, but she could find no mental issues except for the\nhistorical problems. Her problem was whether she should certify that he\nwas mentally fit to consent to donation when she recognized that this was\nhis way of symbolizing a life change.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n. What are some ethical concerns that could arise with altruistic organ dona-\ntion? What safeguards would you recommend to address the concerns you\nidentified?",

    "case": "Case 12-8\nThe Interrogation of Guantanamo Prisoner Mohammed al-Qahtani\nIn August 2001, Mohammed al-Qahtani arrived in the Orlando Florida\nAirport, allegedly to join the group of men who would go on to hijack the\nplanes on September 11. However, an observant interviewer was suspicious\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s story and deported him back to Saudi Arabia. During\nthe American invasion of Afghanistan in 2002, American soldiers captured\nMr. al-Qahtani and transferred him to the detention center at Guantanamo\nBay. Once authorities realized that he may have been directly involved\nwith the 9/11 hijackers, he was labeled a “high-value detainee.”\nIn 2002, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized\nextraordinary interrogation techniques for high-value detainees. He also\nmandated that these interrogations be subject to oversight by health\nprofessionals. To implement these policies, special teams were created to\nwork on interrogations—they were called Behavioral Science Consultation\nTeams (BSCTs). These teams were headed by a psychologist or psychiatrist.\nTheir job was not simply to monitor interrogations but to employ their\nknowledge of human psychology to better exploit a prisoner's psychological\nand cultural vulnerabilities for the purposes of extracting information.\nUnder the new interrogation guidelines, Mr. al-Qahtani was interro-\ngated using very aggressive and controversial techniques. These included\nbeing deprived of sleep for more than a week at a time, having hypothermia\ninduced by air conditioning, being exposed to barking, growling dogs to\nwhich the prisoner had a phobia, being forced to take many bags of intra-\nvenous fluid and then to urinate on himself, and being forced to violate\nvarious Islamic religious obligations and prohibitions.\nThroughout Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation, he was monitored daily\nby physicians. Although the physicians were officially not involved in the\ninterrogation itself but only in ensuring the prisoners continued health,\nthey were in frequent contact with the prisoner during the ongoing interro-\ngation. They helped to facilitate these tactics by approving the continua-\ntion of interrogation immediately after Mr. al-Qahtani had been treated\nfor severe hypothermia. On at least one occasion a medical professional\nwas involved in the administration of large amounts of intravenous fluid\nto the prisoner against his will for the purpose of causing discomfort and\nhumiliation.\nThe involvement of the BSCT psychologist in the interrogation tactics\nwas even more extensive. An army investigation revealed that the BSCT\npsychologist witnessed and possibly encouraged the use of growling and\nbarking dogs to terrify the prisoner. A log that details a two-month period\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation revealed that a BSCT psychologist later\nidentified as Major John Leso was present during the interrogation ses-\nsions. The log notes two instances in which Major Leso directly encour-\naged controversial psychological tactics. In the first instance, Major Leso\nsuggested that the prisoner be placed in a swivel chair so that he could be\nprevented from focusing his eyes on one spot. In the second instance, after\ndays of allowing the prisoner no sleep other than brief naps while shackled\nto the interrogation chair, Mr. al-Qahtani requested that he be allowed to\nsleep in a room other than the interrogation room. When interrogators\nconsulted Major Leso, he said that \"the detainee was only trying to run\nan approach on the control and gain sympathy.””\nIn addition to these two instances of the psychologist’s encouragement\nof controversial tactics, there is evidence of numerous other ways in which\nthe BSCT may have advised interrogators on how to harmfully manipulate\nthe prisoner's emotions and beliefs. Interrogators systematically violated\nvarious Islamic prohibitions. For example, a female interrogator would se-\nductively touch the prisoner. The interrogators disrespectfully handled the\nQuran. They shaved the prisoner's head and beard and repeatedly refused\nto allow him to pray. Further, they employed dehumanizing techniques\nsuch as leashing the prisoner like a dog and making him bark and remark-\ning that the prisoner's life was worse than that of the rats inhabiting the\ncompound.”’",

She feels for-\ntunate to have gotten the job, because the hospital is nationally known and\nthe occupational therapy program is well established. She is involved in\ncare conferences on all of the patients. Her input is valued because of her\nhonesty and insight into the problems of her adolescent patients.\nAt a unit meeting, the chief psychiatrist informs the team that he is going\nto begin using a new type of behavior modification with his patients whose\nbehavior had been diagnosed as an “adjustment disorder with mixed distur-\nbance of emotions and conduct.” He is vague as to the exact type of treatment\nhe plans to use, but he has a solid reputation in the community and the\nhospital, hence the rest of the staff supports him.

    "case": "Case 13-1\nWarning: Premarital Sex May Be Dangerous to Your Health\nThe British General Medical Council's Disciplinary Committee was\ncharged in 1971 with the task of deciding whether or not a physician was\nguilty of “serious professional misconduct,” whereupon it made the following\nreport: '\nThe Committee next inquired into the charge against Dr. Robert John Denis\nBrowne of Birmingham, that he had disclosed to the father of a Miss X that an\noral contraceptive had been prescribed for her by the Birmingham Brook Ad-\nvisory Centre, notwithstanding that he had been given the information in\nconfidence by the Centre and that he had neither sought nor received her per-\nmission to make the disclosure.\nThe complainant was the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre, which was\nrepresented by Mr. G. 8. Jonas, Solicitor. ...\nMr. Jonas said that it was only after the most anxious thought and de-\nliberation, including meetings with Dr. Browne, that the matter had been\nbrought before the Disciplinary Committee. Dr. Browne had practiced in\nBirmingham since 1941 and was highly regarded by his patients. Mr. Jonas\nalleged that, in his capacity as a doctor, he had received confidential infor-\nmation about one of his patients and quite deliberately and, for no valid\nmedical reason, had betrayed that confidence by telling the patient's father\nwhat he had been told.\nAt the time Miss X called at the center she was just over 16, a highly\nintelligent, attractive, and mature young woman. Mr. Jonas told the Com-\nmittee that when an oral contraceptive was prescribed, it was the practice\nof the clinic to inform the family doctor unless the patient specifically for-\nbade it. In this instance, Miss X agreed to her doctor being informed.\nDr. Browne had informed the girl's father that she was “on the pill.” No\neffort had been made by Dr. Browne to discuss the matter with his patient,\nand the patient's consent to this disclosure was neither sought nor ob-\ntained. Dr. Browne had said he would have to do the same again in every\ncase that came to his notice, and the only situation he could see was that\nthe center should never again inform him if one of his patients came to see\nthem. He had said it was all very well for the clinic prescribing the pill but,\nif anything went wrong, he would have to deal with the problem. The\nburden of the complaint was that the doctor let his views interfere with the\nobjectivity demanded of a professional man.\n[A clinic physician testified that he] felt it important that the general\npractitioner should be informed so that if there were any side effect the\ndoctor would have knowledge that the girl was taking oral contraceptives.\nMr. R. Alexander, Counsel for Dr. Browne submitted that this was not, in\nany sense, a test case. The sole issue was whether this respected doctor\nhad been guilty of the offense of serious professional misconduct. There\nwere three issues: first, could one doctor unilaterally impose a confidence\non another, and by unilaterally he meant could he do so without seeking the\nconsent of the other doctor; second, what was the position with regard to the\nduty or right of a doctor to tell the parents of a child who had not reached\nthe age of majority of the medical treatment that child was receiving; and\nthe third issue was that medical confidence existed for the benefit of the\npatient. If the doctor believed it to be in the interests of the patient to reveal\nthe confidence to a third party, then he was entitled to do so.\nDr. Browne, in evidence, said that he was 63 years of age and was mar-\nried with three children, including a girl of 18. He had qualified in 1941 and\nhad been in practice in Birmingham for about thirty years. The parents of\nthe girl had been his patients for many years, and he had been their doctor\nat the time of her birth. She had been his patient all her life. She still was\nhis patient, and he had seen her professionally quite recently.\nWhen he had received the letter from the Brook Centre, it sounded an\nalarm bell in his mind. He was concerned that a girl only just 16 had been\nplaced on a contraceptive pill without prior knowledge or consultation with\nthe family doctor. It was a stable family, with the daughter living at home.\nHe had discussed the matter, which gave him great anxiety, with profes-\nsional colleagues. He tried to get an estimate of the situation without men-\ntioning anyone’s name and considered the problem carefully.\nThe girl's father happened to come to the surgery shortly after this, and\nhe asked him if his daughter was getting married. The father said that she\nwas not, but that she had a steady boyfriend and was still at school.\nDr. Browne said he thought hard and then made up his mind—bearing in\nmind the girl's best interests, and for that reason solely—and handed the\nfather a copy of the letter from the Centre and explained what it meant.\nDr. Browne said that he had had two motives in informing the parents.\nOne was the physical hazards of the pill, and second were the moral and\npsychological hazards. He was not standing in judgment, but with his\nknowledge of the home background, and knowing the parents were sym-\npathetic and kindly and could handle the situation with care and tact, he\nconsidered that parents were the best people to counsel her in their own\nway. He also saw psychological hazards, for if she were keeping a secret\nshe might have a sense of guilt, which could have a harmful effect on her\nemotionally. He pointed out that it would have been difficult for him to con-\ntact the girl without arousing parental suspicion. The episode did not\nappear to have impaired his relationship with Miss X.\nIn reply to cross-examination by Mr. Jonas, Dr. Browne said that his in-\nterests were primarily for the patient and for her alone. He had no other inter-\nest except what was best for her. His patient was being placed on a dangerous\ndrug, without his prior knowledge or consent, with all the hazards that might\ninvolve—and steroid drugs were a particular hazard.\nDr. Walter Woolley, ex-Chairman of the Central Ethical Committee of\nthe British Medical Association, told the Committee he had been a family\ndoctor since 1933. In his view, a third party could not fetter the right of the\ndoctor—for instance, by a letter such as the one from the Brook Centre—to\nexercise his own judgment.\nDame Amis Gillie said that she had had thirty-eight years’ experi-\nence in general practice, and, in her view, professional secrecy existed in\nthe interest of the patient. She considered that there could be situations in\nwhich the benefit of the patient meant that a confidence must be dis-\nclosed. Every case should be judged on its own merits by the practitioner\ninvolved.\nThe final witness was Dr. J. C. Cameron, Chairman of the General\nMedical Services Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA). He\nhad been in general practice for many years and believed that a long-\nstanding knowledge of a patient was of great advantage in forming an as-\nessment of a situation. He would have preferred that, if possible, the girl's\nconsent should have been sought prior to the disclosure to her parents, but\nthere might be circumstances in which this was impracticable.\nAfter consideration in camera the President said:\nThe Committee has found [that it has been] proved that the information you\nreceived from the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre was in confidence, and\nthat you had neither sought nor received the patient's permission to make the\ndisclosure; but in the particular circumstances of this case... the Committee\ndo not regard your action in disclosing the information referred to in the\ncharge as improper. The Committee therefore has not found that the whole of\nthe facts alleged in the charge, including the word ‘improperly,’ have been\nproved. It has accordingly recorded a finding that you are not guilty of serious\nprofessional misconduct.\n\nCase 13-2\nThe Murder of Tatiana Tarasoff: The Therapist’s Duty to Warn\nProsenjit Poddar, a graduate student at the University of California, had a\nromantic interest in a fellow student named Tatiana Tarasoff. She did not\nreciprocate that interest, which led to Mr. Poddar’s depression. He eventu-\nally sought the assistance of the Dr. Lawrence Moore, a psychologist at the\nCowell Memorial Hospital at the university. Mr. Poddar confided his inten-\ntion to kill Tatiana.\nThat Dr. Moore took the threat seriously is confirmed by his notifying\nthe campus police, who briefly detained Mr. Poddar but soon released him\nwhen he appeared rational to them. Dr. Moore's supervisor, Dr. Harvey\nPowelson, directed that no further action be taken. Ms. Tarasoff was out of\nthe country visiting an aunt in Brazil. Neither Ms. Tarasoff nor her parents\nwere warned of the threat. When the young woman returned Mr. Poddar\nbegan stalking her and eventually stabbed her to death.\nMs. Tarasoff's parents sued Dr. Moore, Dr. Powelson, the campus police,\nand the university, alleging that they failed to warn Tatiana or her parents\nand failed to see that Mr. Poddar was confined.\nMany psychiatrists, psychologists, and police came to the defense of\ntheir colleagues in this case. Their professional associations entered the\ncase on their behalf. Those focusing on the health professional's duty\nargued that danger to others is not accurately predictable, but even if it\nwere, the duty of the psychologist or psychiatrist in this case is to the pa-\ntient, not to third parties. Furthermore, they contended that a policy requir-\ning a duty to warn would dissuade potential patients from seeking\nprofessional assistance, thus eliminating a potential benefit to the one in\ndanger.\nThose supporting the parents argued that the duty of a professional\ncannot be limited to the patient when the health professional has knowl-\nedge of a serious and credible threat of grave bodily harm.\nThe police were found according to state law to be immune from liabil-\nity and had no duty to warn. The medical personnel were immune from\nfailing to confine Mr. Poddar but concluded they could face charges of fail-\nure to warn. The court concluded:\nWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profes-\nsion should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of vio-\nlence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect\nthe intended victim against such danger. The discharge of this duty may\nrequire the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon\n| 284\nChapter 13 Confidentiality: Ethical Disclosure of Medical Information\n\nthe nature of the case. Thus it may call for him to warn the intended victim\nor others likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to notify the police,\nor to take whatever others steps are reasonably necessary under the\ncircumstances.\n\nCase 13-3\nThe Required State Psychiatric Diagnosis Record\nFor Andrew Gorly, it was the second admission to the Brooklyn Psychiatric\nClinic. The patient had been subdued on the corner of Rose and Belmont\nStreets. He claimed that the Nazis were infiltrating the Political Science De-\npartment of the university where he was a graduate student. The patient\nhad, that afternoon, assaulted three innocent passersby, whom he accused\nof being part of the conspiracy. Mr. Gorly was scheduled to take his doc-\ntoral examination the coming Tuesday. He had been up for three consecu-\ntive nights reading modern European political history, cramming for one of\nhis exams. After completing the exams and writing his dissertation, the\npatient was planning on a career in the foreign service. His professors had\nalways thought of him as a bit strange but considered him one of the bright\nyoung scholars in the department. They had tried to persuade him to go into\nteaching, but he was an activist; he still had faith that hard-working, intel-\nligent foreign service officers could do something to change American for-\nign policy.\nHis parents brought him to the Brooklyn Psychiatric Clinic late that eve-\nning. The diagnosis was an acute p\n...[TRUNCATED]",

    "case": "Case 14-2\nPediatric Heart Procurement in Denver\nThe Pediatric Heart Transplant Team at Children’s Hospital, Denver, led by\nsurgeon Mark Boucek, was concerned about the shortage of infant hearts\nfor transplant. It developed a protocol for a clinical trial for the use of hearts\nprocured from newborns with conditions incompatible with life.\u0002 It pro-\ncured and transplanted three hearts. Decisions to withdraw life support on\ngrounds of futility were made by clinicians independent of the transplant\nteam and with the consent of the infants’ parents. After the deaths of the\ninfants, determined by cardiocirculatory criteria, the hearts were procured\n(referred to as “donation after death from cardiocirculatory causes”). They\nwere transplanted into three infants of compatible blood group who were\nin the highest priority status for heart transplant. Parents of the recipients\nwere given a choice of waiting for hearts procured from infants following\nconventional brain death or receiving these hearts.\nAlthough the protocol was potentially controversial because of risks to\nrecipients receiving hearts procured in a novel way, the major debate was\nover the question of whether the infants from whom the hearts were pro-\ncured were really dead at the time the hearts were removed.\nTwo issues were debated. First, no accepted peer-reviewed standard\nexisted for how long to wait after cessation of heart beat before pronouncing\ndeath in newborns. The Institute of Medicine's 2006 recommended stan-\ndard for adults was 5 minutes,\u0002 but it is generally recognized that infants\n|\ncannot be expected to react in the same way as adults. The Denver team\nwaited 3 minutes for its first case and 75 seconds for the second and third\ncases. They based their decision in the first case on a recommendation of\nthe ethics committee of the American College of Critical Care Medicine\nand the Society for Critical Care Medicine, published in 2001, that stated\n2 minutes of asystole for adults was sufficient.!\u0010 The latter two cases in\nwhich the wait time was 75 seconds was a position endorsed by the local\nethics committee. Critics argued that there was not adequate peer-reviewed\ndata to support the short wait time.\u000b\nSecond, regardless of whether the waiting time had been sufficient,\nother critics raised the question of whether someone can be said to be dead\nby cardiocirculatory criteria if the heart, a critical part of the circulatory\nsystem, not only could function at some future time but actually did so. This\nwas evidenced by the fact that all three hearts functioned successfully in\nthe recipients. The Denver team argued that it does not matter if the hearts\nfunctioned in the future. The circulation in the donor infants was, in fact,\npermanently stopped. They no doubt would admit that the donor infants’\ncirculatory systems could have been restarted in those infants. Their claim\nwas that, as long as it did not actually start in those infants, they could be\ncalled dead.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nIs this case particularly problematic because it involves newborns rather than\nadult patients?\n.. What types of ethical and psychological issues arise with the practice of donation\nafter cardiac death?",

    "case": "Case 14-3\nTainted Organs: Donors with High-Risk Lifestyles\nCarol Weekley, the Director of Gift of Life, the organ procurement organiza-\ntion for an East Coast metropolitan area, received a phone call that a pa-\ntient at City Hospital had met preliminary criteria for brain death and was\na potential source of organs. Joel Williams, a 25-year-old Caucasian male,\nhad succumbed to a gunshot wound to the head, apparently in retaliation\nfor a drug deal that had gone bad. Physicians at City Hospital had done all\nthey could to save his life but did not succeed. The family was now asking\nabout the possibility of donating his organs for transplant.\nA young, previously healthy person who suddenly receives a fatal\ngunshot wound is, in many ways, an ideal source of organs, but Williams\nhad a long history of intravenous (IV) drug abuse and evidence of bad\nheart valves probably related to his drug use. That meant that his heart\nor its valves would not be usable, but other organs were potentially of\nusable quality. Preliminary tests had shown good liver and kidney func-\ntion. Williams's mother wanted something good to come from his death,\nwhich she considered a terrible waste of what had once been a promis-\ning son.\nA history of IV drug abuse is a warning sign in transplantation. IV drug\nuse is one of the major sources of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\ninfection. Williams had screened negative for HIV, but there was some\nchance he had not seroconverted, that he was actually carrying a recently\nacquired HIV infection. Transplanting organs from an infected person\nposed a danger of transmission of HIV. Organs would be perfused to\nremove as much of Williams's blood as possible, but the virus could still be\npresent in the organs.\nAt one time, those with high-risk lifestyles including homosexual men\nand IV drug abusers were routinely disqualified as donors. Now, however,\nthousands were dying while on the waiting list for organs, and transplant\ncommunity professionals were questioning whether such organs should\nalways be discarded. The chance of such persons being infected was very\n( a303\nlow, and a transplant might not transmit an infection. (Surgeons would\nnever intentionally transplant an organ from someone with known HIV in-\nfection, but screening for HIV was expensive, time-consuming, and not\ncompletely reliable.)\nThe problem was made more complicated by the fact that having HIV no\nlonger disqualifies one from being listed for transplant. People who need\norgans for reasons that may be unrelated to their HIV receive organs using\nthe standard allocation system. Ms. Weekley realized that she could offer\nMr. Williams's organs to those on the list who were already HIV-positive. This\nmight theoretically increase their risk by adding copies of the virus, possibly\nintroducing a new strain that could make the disease worse. On the other\nhand, some of these candidates on the list might be suffering significantly\nfor need of an organ—perhaps declining toward death. For kidneys, the wait\ncan be five years for a normal organ, a waiting time that could be unattract-\nive to potential recipients. It had even been suggested that those with HIV\nmight find solidarity with a donor who shares the disease or a risk of it.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould Ms. Weekley offer the organs to those on the waiting list with a history\nof HIV?\nWould there be circumstances under which she should offer it to those with-\nout such a history?",

Soon it became clear that he would not recover and, in fact, was\nprogressing toward brain death.\nIn his possession at the time of the accident was an organ donor card\nindicating he would want to be a donor in the event of such an accident.\nHis family had been with him for three days and was now resigned to the\nfact that he would not recover. They initiated a conversation with the per-\nsonnel in the intensive care unit (ICU) that they knew he was an organ\ndonor. They stated clearly that they wanted something good to come from\nthis tragedy.\nThe patient had been tested for brain function. He presently did not meet\nbrain criteria for pronouncing death. The ICU attending physician explained\nthe options. They could maintain maximal life support (but acknowledged\nthat he would never recover consciousness). They could withdraw all life\nsupport and allow him to die. They expected that withdrawal of a ventilator\nwould probably result in death based on stoppage of heart function over the\ncourse of the next day or so.\nWhen the family again raised the question of organ donation, the ICU\nteam indicated that might be possible but were concerned that prolonged\ndeterioration would make donation after circulatory death (DCD) unlikely\nand that waiting for brain death criteria to be met might take so long that\nhis organs would no longer be usable.\nThe attending physician was aware of another possibility. They could\nmedicate him using vasopressor and heparin, not for Mr. Hendershott’s\nbenefit, but in order to preserve the organs for transplant. Their concern,\nhowever, was that these drugs could pose a slight risk of hastening the\ndeath. This might happen, for example, if Mr. Hendershott had a slow in-\nternal bleed that would be made worse by the heparin. They also expressed\nconcern of another kind. Maintaining Mr. Hendershott on a ventilator\ncould pose the possibility that he would stabilize and never progress to\nbrain death. He could remain in a coma and not die even if the ventilator\nwere disconnected. Since the physicians and family were in agreement\nthat it was not serving Mr. Hendershott's interest to preserve his life any\nlonger, the physician believed that he could, in good conscience, neither admin-\nister vasopressors and heparin, which could count as actively killing the\npatient, nor maintain the ventilator, which could inappropriately preserve\nhis life.\nThe family still insisted that Mr. Hendershott would want everything\ndone to make his organs transplantable, especially since he would not\nsuffer in any way from the drugs or the ventilator.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n' At this point, whose argument do you find most persuasive—the attending\nphysician’s or the family’s?\n| What other factors, either clinical or situational, would you find helpful in\nresolving the issue of preserving the organs or not?",

In the mid-1990s, the com-\nmittee took up the controversial question of whether a history of alcoholism\nshould come into play in allocating livers.\nLiver failure can result from many causes. Some patients have failing\nlivers as a result of an in-born condition called biliary atresia, a blockage\nin the liver that causes liver failure. Surely, neither the small children with\nthis condition nor their parents are in any way responsible for this type of\nliver failure.\nOther causes involve more problematic behaviors—exposure to toxic\nchemicals and abusable drugs. Those damaging their livers in this way\nmay have no advance knowledge of the risk. They may not even voluntarily\nchoose to be exposed.\nAlcohol consumption is a major cause of liver failure and the need for\ntransplant. It is notoriously difficult to determine the extent to which alco-\nholism involves a voluntary component. The issue debated in the UNOS\nEthics Committee was whether a history of alcoholism should play a role in\nallocating livers, and, if so, what role it should play.\nThe committee staked out four positions. Theoretically, one could have\na full and equal claim to a liver even if one were an active alcoholic. No one\non the committee took that position. Everyone agreed that there must be\nevidence that the alcoholic was to some degree recovered. Most thought\nthat at least six months of abstinence, preferably a year, was needed to\nshow a likelihood that the patient would not return to drinking and damage\nthe new liver the way he or she had damaged the original one.\nAt the other extreme, one could take the view that, since the choice to\nconsume alcohol damaged what was presumably a perfectly good liver,\nthe alcoholic patient had no entitlement to a liver for transplant at all. This\nview might lead to the conclusion that even if there were extra livers avail-\nable, the alcoholic patient did not deserve one. No one on the committee\n| 316 |\ntook this view either.",

    "case": "Case 14-10\nDo Children Have Low Priority for Adult Lungs?\nSarah Murnaghan, age 10, had long suffered from cystic fibrosis. She\nwas now in the intensive care unit of Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia.\nHer parents, Janet and Francis Murnaghan, claimed that if she did not\nreceive a set of donated lungs, she would die soon, possibly in a matter\nof weeks or sooner. They sued the federal government's Department of\nHealth and Human Services, claiming that the existing lung allocation\nsystem discriminated against children, violating the law that requires\nequitable allocation of organs. They sought, and soon got, a temporary\nrestraining order, requiring that their daughter be added to the adult\nlung allocation list.\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the national agency\nunder contract to the federal government to manage the organ procurement\nand transplant system, was ordered to place Sarah on the adult lung allo-\ncation list as if she were an adult. UNOS has a long-standing policy of al-\nlocating adult lungs to adults with children only eligible for lungs from\nadults if no adult would take an available set. By contrast, children under\nage of 12 were first priority for lungs from children and second priority\n(before adults) for lungs procured from adolescents 12 to 18 years of age.\nThe reason for this arrangement was that adult lungs typically will not fit\nin the chest of a child without the poorly developed procedure of cutting\nthem down to size. Conversely, placing a small set of lungs from a child\ninto an adult was not ideal either. If Sarah were to be placed on the adult\nlist, she would retain her position on the pediatric list, thus giving her first\npriority for pediatric lungs plus normal priority for adult lungs, arguably\ngiving her an unfair advantage over others on the list. Adult lungs are al-\nlocated to adults using a lung allocation score (LAS), an empirical measure\nthat predicts the good done from a transplant based on expected survival\nwith and without a transplant. In order to list Sarah on the adult list, she\nwould need a LAS, but not all the data elements are available for children,\nand the use of the LAS for children has not been validated. Thus, critics\nclaimed there is no way to know exactly where Sarah should be placed on\nthe adult list. In response to the temporary restraining order, UNOS made\nan estimate of her LAS, filling in missing data where necessary.\nAt the time there were thirty children under age 12 waiting for lungs.\nTwenty sets of lungs had been procured during the 2012 calendar year. By\ncontrast there were about 1600 adults on the waiting list for lungs, and\nabout 1600 sets of adult lungs were procured in 2012. In addition, 144 lungs\nwere procured from adolescents in 2012, for which children have second\npriority and only 45 adolescents on the waiting list. This might imply that\nchildren actually had a slightly better chance of getting a set of lungs than\nadults. This is somewhat misleading, however, since priorities are as-\nsigned locally and the children’s and adolescent lungs will go to adults on\nthe waiting list locally before they go to children beyond the local area.\nHence, a small number of pediatric lungs is available for a small number\nof recipients. When one takes into account the necessity of blood-type\nmatching, the chances of a successful procurement of pediatric lungs of the\n| 319\nright type are low whereas the large number of adult lungs for the large\nnumber of potential adult recipients makes a successful match easier to\nachieve. Even taking into account the scarcity of pediatric lungs, trans-\nplant professionals claimed that judicial intervention for Sarah Murnaghan\nwas not warranted and that judges or other public commentators were not\n- in a position to consider all the complex variables that should go into an\nefficient and equitable lung allocation.\nSarah received a set of adult lungs soon after the temporary restrain-\ning order was granted. Those lungs, which apparently had to be cut to fit,\nwere rejected, leading to the allocation of a second set of lungs. The second\nset might not have been accepted for adults since they had been exposed\nto pneumonia infection, a significant risk in lung transplant when immuno-\nsuppression was necessary.",

Casey,\nwhich upheld provisions for parental notification in the case of minors and\na twenty-four-hour waiting period.””\nAlthough unknown to his constituents, Gov. Casey was diagnosed in\n1990 with a rare genetic disease, Appalachian familiar amyloidosis, in\nwhich production of amyloid was destroying his organs.” On June 14, 1993,\njust a few days after his disease was announced to the public, he received\na rare combined heart-liver transplant. There was dispute about whether\nhe received preferential treatment because of his public status as gover-\nnor. Some claim he was moved to the head of the waiting list. Others say he\nhad actually been on the waiting list for a year.\nThere were no clear rules for how allocation should be handled in the\ncase of such a rare combination of organs. It is generally agreed that when\nmore than one organ needs to be transplanted, they should be done simul-\ntaneously in order to avoid the trauma of two operations. Normally the\norgans would be obtained from the same donor, thus avoiding the addi-\ntional problem of exposure to two sets of foreign antigens. A case can be\nmade that if all the organs needed for a multiple-organ procedure are\navailable, they should go to someone who needs them both, at least if that\nperson is at the top of the waiting list for one of the organs.\nGiven that no clear rules were in place and that Gov.

The fact that he\nwas responsible for the welfare of all the citizens of Pennsylvania suggests\nan additional reason why he might be given special status. On the other\nhand, a multiple-organ transplant consumes two life-prolonging organs—a\nheart and a liver—both of which are so scarce that a person on the waiting\nlist will die because he or she will not receive them. Thus, two people will\ngo without transplant if the multiple-organ procedure is carried out.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould one person be entitled to two life-prolonging organs when two other\npeople also need them?\nIf that is acceptable, should fame or responsibility for others ever command\nspecial consideration in organ allocation decisions?",

Because his Fentora prescription costs approximately $1,500 a month,\nMr. Horrigan cannot afford to pay for it out of pocket. As a result, he visits\nthe emergency room (ER) on a biweekly basis so that he can receive the\nmedication at the hospital and avoid suffering from a seizure caused by\nhis extremely severe pain.

    "case": "Case 16-1\nChemotherapy Risks: Is Going without Chemotherapy a Benefit?\nLaurie DeSoto, a 16-year-old girl who had recently been diagnosed with\nleukemia, came to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic with her mother to dis-\ncuss treatment options with Dr. Elizabeth Holmes, the oncologist who had\nassumed responsibility for her care when she was referred to the clinic.\nSeveral different chemotherapy regimens were under consideration, but\nDr. Holmes thought Laurie might be an ideal candidate for a research pro-\ntocol now under way at the clinic.\n\nThe protocol involved a standard four-drug regimen that had been\nused successfully for Laurie's type of leukemia for several years. The origi-\nnal regimen required patients to be on the drugs for five years. After consid-\nerable experience with this drug schedule, oncologists began to suspect\nthat the patients on it did not need to continue the drug for five years. The\ndata from long experience showed that three years was just as effective\nas judged by the percentage of patients who remained leukemia-free for\nfive years. The three-year regimen was now the standard. It was used\nwidely in oncology programs throughout the United States and elsewhere.\nOn the basis of that experience, Dr. Holmes and several colleagues\nbegan to wonder whether two years on the regimen might be as effective.\nThey realized that the adolescents taking the drug had to endure the side\neffects of the chemotherapy—the nausea, hair loss, and other effects—and\nwould appreciate having to stay on the regimen only two years rather\nthan three. On the other hand, if they were wrong, it would mean that some\npatients taken off the regimen after the shorter period might have recur-\nrence of their disease—a terrible, potentially fatal result.\n\nDr. Holmes had become the principal investigator of a new research\nprotocol that would randomize patients to receiving either the now-standard\nthree-year regimen or to an experimental group that received exactly the\nsame drug combination but for only two years. It was based on preliminary\nevidence from several clinical cases in which, for various reasons, patients\nhad stopped the treatment after two years and had not had recurrence of\ntheir leukemia. The protocol had to be approved by the hospital IRB, the\ngroup charged with protecting human subjects of research.\n\nOne of the criteria for approval was that the risks to subjects were\nreasonable and were justified by the potential benefits. The review board,\nafter considerable discussion, voted, by an eight-to-two margin, that the\nrisks were reasonably balanced. In other words, the majority of the board\nthought that the small risk of greater chance of recurrence of the leukemia\nwas justified by the benefits to the youngsters who received the shorter\ntwo-year regimen.\n\nDr. Holmes now decided to present the opportunity to enter this proto-\ncol to Laurie DeSoto and her mother. If they agreed to enter the study, Laurie\nwould be assigned randomly to either a standard three-year regimen or\nan experimental two-year treatment. Although subjects of research are\nnormally “blinded,” that is, kept ignorant of which treatment arm they\nenter, in this case that would not be possible since patients and physicians\nwould clearly know whether they were receiving the treatment for three\nyears or two. If the investigators and the IRB believe that the risks and\nbenefits are more or less equally balanced between the two groups, such\nrandomization is considered morally acceptable. When two treatment arms\nin a research protocol are perceived as being equally balanced in their\nrisks and benefits, the study is said to be in equipoise. Since Dr. Holmes\nand the IRB agreed that the risks were evenly balanced, they considered\nthe offer to be randomized morally justified.\n\nDr. Holmes presented the study to Laurie and her mother, including the\nfact that, if they agreed to enter the study, they would be randomly as-\nsigned to either three years or two years of treatment. After being given an\nopportunity to ask any questions, Mrs. DeSoto signed the consent form on\nbehalf of Laurie. Laurie, as a minor, could not give her own consent, but\nwas nevertheless asked to give her “assent,” which she gave. This amounts\nto approval even though it is not based on a level of understanding and\nvoluntariness that we would expect from an adult.\n\nDr. Holmes, having received documented consent, left the room and\nsoon returned with the news that Laurie had been randomly assigned to\nthe three-year arm, that is, the existing standard treatment. To her sur-\nprise, Laurie burst into tears. When asked, she explained she really\nwanted the two-year treatment course. She hated the thought of the side\neffects, especially the hair loss. She did not want to look strange for any\nlonger than necessary. She sobbed in her mother’s arms as Dr. Holmes\nlooked on.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nHad Dr. Holmes and the IRB assessed the risks and benefits properly?\nWhat might the IRB and the researchers done differently in assessing the risks\nand benefits of the study?\nWho is best situated to assess the risks and benefits in research studies?

    "case": "Case 16-2\nResearch to Develop Screening Techniques\nfor HIV-Infected Blood\nDr. Michael Willey, the director of the blood bank at a major inner-city hospital,\nwas interested in developing better techniques for screening blood for viral\ninfections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). He wanted to do a\nlarge-scale trial of new tests that eventually could permit him to screen blood\nmore quickly and cheaply. He was also interested in identifying high-risk\nblood sources so that, if necessary, extra precautions could be taken with\nblood obtained through certain clinics and from certain sociological groups.\nTo conduct this research he needed a large number of samples of fresh\nblood. He would not need large samples, just enough to perform one of his ex-\nperimental tests and run the more traditional screens to provide a basis for\nseeing if his new techniques were accurate. He would not need to know the\nnames of those providing the blood, but he would want some general back-\nground information—the clinic from which the sample was obtained and the\nage, race, and admitting diagnosis of the patient from whom it was obtained.\nRather than impose on a large number of patients to contribute the\nsamples for these initial tests, he proposed to take the “remaindered” or\nleft-over blood from routine laboratory studies. This blood was normally\ndiscarded but would be perfectly suited for his research. He therefore pro-\nposed to the IRB that, when his lab was finished with blood samples, the\nremaindered blood be transferred to the research technician with names\nand identifying numbers removed. Only the clinic, age, race, and diagnosis\nwould be retained. He wanted to obtain a thousand such samples for his\nresearch. Since the lab would not know which samples would provide\nenough blood until the clinically required tests had been completed and, at\nthat point, the patients would be hard to track down to obtain consent, the\ninvestigator proposed that the consent requirement be waived. He pointed\nout that such left-over blood had been used for research for years without\nconsent of the patients.\n\nThe IRB received this protocol and determined that there was no plau-\nsible risk to the subjects and that there was no risk of confidentiality being\nbreached since critical identifying information would not even be retained.\nTechnically, such research could be deemed “exempt” from IRB review. The\nregulations state that research is exempt if it is:\nResearch involving the collection or study of existing data, documents, records,\npathological specimens, or diagnostic specimens, if these sources are publicly\navailable or if the information is recorded by the investigator in such a manner\nthat subjects cannot be identified, directly or through identifiers linked to the\nsubjects.\nAlthough this research might meet federal requirements for an exemp-\ntion, the IRB chose not to grant the exemption. It was concerned that, even if\nthe research were risk-free and posed no chance of a breach of confidential-\nity, there were elements of the research that could raise concern. Subjects\nmight be interested in the fact that the research involved HIV, and they were\ncontributing to a project that could eventually stereotype certain clinics,\nraces, or diagnoses. For these reasons the IRB retained jurisdiction over the\nresearch proposal. For the same reasons it refused to review the research\non an expedited basis, a procedure whereby one member of the IRB could\nconduct the review and report back to the IRB at its next meeting.\n\nSome members of the IRB insisted that most patients would not be con-\ncerned about these matters. Given the absence of risk, the impossibility of\na confidentiality breach, and the difficulty in getting consent, they favored\ngranting the investigator's request for access to the remaindered blood\nwithout consent. Others, however, objected. While they found the research\nworthwhile and essentially risk-free, they believed some subjects would\nwant to consent before contributing to this research.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould the IRB grant approval?\nShould subjects be routinely informed of the purpose and sponsor of a\nresearch study if the study is essentially risk-free? Why might a subject want to\nknow this type of information?",

    "case": "Case 16-3\nExplanation of Risks and the SUPPORT Study\nIn a multi-center study called the Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and\nOxygenation Randomized Trial (SUPPORT), which eventually enrolled\nmore than 1,300 infants, part of the research focused on the amount of sup-\nplemental oxygen provided to extremely premature infants. Premature in-\nfants are often given oxygen, but at the outset of the SUPPORT study, it was\nnot clear exactly how much oxygen to give. At the time, it was known that\nmaintaining high levels of oxygen in the blood of premature infants could\nresult in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in which abnormal blood vessels\nand scar tissue can grow over the retina and damage vision. The informed\nconsent form for the SUPPORT study specifically noted the higher risk of\nROP but stated, “the benefit of higher versus lower levels of oxygenation in\ninfants, especially in premature infants, is not known.” The standard of care\nin neonatal intensive care units across the United States at the time of the\ninitiation of the SUPPORT study was to target values of the partial pressure of\narterial oxygen anywhere between 50 and 80 mm Hg, which would be\nconsistent with oxygen saturations, measured by pulse oximetry, between\n85 and 95 percent. The SUPPORT study aimed to determine whether the\nupper or lower end of this range might result in better outcomes for prema-\nture infants. For premature infants not enrolled in the SUPPORT study, the\nrange of oxygen saturation was at the discretion of the infant’s physician.\n\nInfants enrolled in the SUPPORT study were assigned to either the\nlower-range group that had a target oxygen saturation of 85-89 percent or\nthe higher-range group that had a target oxygen saturation of 91-95 percent.\nIt was only after the completion of the study in 2009 that investigators\nlearned that the infants in the higher range had an increased risk of ROP,\nwhich was a possibility noted to the parents at the outset of the study and\npart of the informed consent document, but a decreased risk of death,\nwhich was not mentioned in the consent document. The infants in the lower\nsaturation range had a statistically increased risk of death. The results\nchanged the standard of care in many medical centers. In 2011, the Office\nfor Human Research Protections (OHRP) initiated an investigation into the\nSUPPORT study. In 2013, the OHRP reached the following conclusion: “It\nwas alleged, and we determine, that the IRB approved informed consent\ndocuments for this study failed to include or adequately address the follow-\ning basic element required by HHS, '... a description of any reasonably\nforeseeable risks and discomforts.” The consent form for the SUPPORT\nstudy included a section on risks and benefits but did not identify any risks\nrelating to randomizing the infants to the low or high oxygen range. The\nresearchers in the SUPPORT study contend that the study made clear that\nhigher oxygen saturation within the then-recommended range (85-95 percent)\nincreased the risk of retinopathy but decreased the risk of death.\n\nSome defenders of the SUPPORT protocol argued that it was sufficient\nthat the parents whose babies became the subjects of the study were told that\nbabies would be assigned to an oxygen saturation at the high end or the low\nend of the standard of care, that both treatments are within the standard of\ncare, and that it was not known which was better. They pointed out that it\ncould not be expected that the investigators would communicate the findings\nof the study before it was completed. Other defenders of the protocol went\neven further. They claimed that when treatments are being assigned that are\nall within the standard of care, subjects (the parents in this case) need not be\ntold anything beyond the fact that they were getting the standard of care.\nFollowing the protest of the investigators and some bioethicists, OHRP\nissued another letter stating that they were placing on hold all further action\nagainst the investigators until appropriate guidance became available.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nShould studies that fall within the standard of care be subject to the rigorous\nconsent standards for studies involving innovative therapies?\nIf you were the parent of a newborn who was eligible for inclusion in the\nSUPPORT study, what would you want to be told about the risks and benefits\nof the study?",

The study involved the use of twenty-\nfour-hour electronic monitors placed on infants that would provide around-\nthe-clock recordings of the infant's heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory\nrate, and other clinical indicators. The goal was to identify markers that\ncould eventually be used to predict which infants were at high risk for\ncardiac or respiratory arrest.\n\nParents signed a standard consent form that explained the nature and\npurpose of the experiment, the funder, and the potential risks, which were con-\nsidered minimal. The monitoring equipment had been well tested and was\ndeemed safe from electrical and mechanical risk to the infants. The consent\nform also contained the standard promise of confidentiality of the medical data.\n\nUnfortunately, one of the infants on the monitor died during the study.\nThis was not entirely unexpected, since all the infants were at high risk. It\nwas discovered, however, that this infant had had an older sibling who\nalso died, and in the case of the earlier death, there was some suspicion\nthat the death might not have been a natural occurrence. A psychological\ncondition known as Munchausen syndrome by proxy involves a parent who\ninduces a medical crisis in a child apparently for the purpose of generating\nattention that satisfies some psychological need of the parent. One method\nof accomplishing this is temporary suffocation of the child followed by a\ncall for rescue. While the purpose is not to kill the child, the risk exists of a\nmiscalculation that can actually cause the child's death.\n\nThe medical examiner in the case of the death of the infant who was the\nsubject of the study began to suspect Munchausen syndrome by proxy and,\nwhen he learned the infant was part of a study involving twenty-four-hour\nmonitoring, asked to see the research records. The records would have in-\ncluded data on the infant with a high potential of revealing the nature of the\ndeath, including the possibility of identifying abnormal activity consistent\nwith an assault. Dr. Carstens realized that she might have the evidence that\na homicide had taken place, indeed, a homicide in a family that had previ-\nously experienced the unexpected death of an infant.

The first four were drugs long known to researchers. The side\neffects anticipated included nausea, vomiting, myelosuppression, stomatitis,\nalopecia, and cardiomyopathy.

It was referred to as “methotrexate with leucovorin rescue.”\nThe protocol called for administering the drugs on a twenty-one-day cycle\nwith methotrexate given on the fifteenth day. All drugs were to be adminis-\ntered on an outpatient basis, except that the methotrexate and intravenous\nleucovorin would be administered on an inpatient basis, thus keeping the\npatients in the hospital for twenty-four hours out of every three weeks.\n\nThe IRB reviewed the protocol, focusing first on the traditional ques-\ntions of the risks and benefits of the five drugs. The debate soon focused\non the methotrexate and leucovorin. Some IRB members were concerned\nthat the oral leucovorin would be given to the patients to take at home.\nGiven the severity of the patients’ illness and the general propensity of\npatients to miss doses of medication, the IRB members were concerned\nthat some patients might forget their rescue medication, which would\nresult in death. It was noted that a patient could even intentionally omit the\noral leucovorin, leaving an exposure to a potential lethal result. It would\namount to suicide by drug refusal. These IRB members proposed that it\nwould be safer for patients to remain in the hospital for the three days to\nassure they received their leucovorin rescue appropriately.\n\nA second contingent of the IRB membership expressed a different con-\ncern, one shared by the investigators. They feared that requiring patients\nto remain in the hospital for three days out of every twenty-one would tax\nthe resources of the research ward of the hospital. Other research projects\nmight have to be put on hold while the research beds were devoted to this\nuse. Concern was expressed not only about the costs, but also about the\nburden on personnel. They also pointed out that the goal of the research\nwas to develop a regimen that could be used widely. Administration of the\noral leucovorin at home was a more plausible strategy considering the\noverall costs and benefits.\n\nA third group in the IRB focused not on the protection of patients or\nthe impact on the institution, but on two other ethical concerns. First, they\nobserved that some patients might find the original protocol with oral\nleucovorin taken at home too burdensome, while others might find being\nhospitalized for three out of every twenty-one days too much to ask. Since\nthese were critically ill patients who were probably dying, this would mean\nasking them to spend as much as one-seventh of the rest of their lives in\nthe hospital when they really did not need to be there. This group proposed\nmodifying the protocol to permit patients to choose either inpatient or out-\npatient administration of the oral leucovorin.\n\nThe research design purists were unhappy with this proposal. It meant\nintroducing another variable into the study. They preferred that all patients\nbe treated identically. To this the defenders of the patient choice provision\nintroduced another argument, thus raising a new moral principle. They ob-\nserved that in this protocol, the patients who could become subjects were\nvery severely ill with drug-resistant tumors. They were probably going to\ndie soon even with the treatment. Thus they could be said to be among the\nworst off in society. It raised the question of how much researchers could\nask of this especially vulnerable and burdened group. They proposed that\nthe modification of the protocol was particularly called for in this case\nbecause the potential subjects were among the worst-off patients, and\nthey had a special claim of justice to be burdened as little as possible by\nthe research. Since they were the only patients who had the cancers that\nwere appropriate for this risky research, it was appropriate to ask them to\nbe subjects, but the patients had a right to expect that the protocol would\nbe as attractive to them as possible. This, they claimed, required modify-\ning the protocol to give this group of patients the choice of where they\nshould receive the oral leucovorin even if it meant that the costs were going\nto be greater than the original outpatient design and even if the research\ndesign was not as clean as it would have been with all patients receiving\nexactly the same treatment.\n\nThe IRB faced a choice: Should patient medical benefit be maximized\nby requiring all to receive the leucovorin in the hospital, should total social\nbenefit be used to justify the original home-based administration, or should\nrespect for patient autonomy and justice require permitting this group of\npatients to choose, even though the costs would be greater than exclusive\nhome-based administration and the research design would be slightly\ninferior?",

Oral insulin\nproducts were a major revenue source. Sometimes, however, the agents the\npatient was using were not effective.\n\nCompound 17392, as the manufacturer referred to it, had now been ap-\nproved for clinical use. Some early-adopting physicians were already\nusing it, especially for their patients who had problems with the earlier\ngeneration agents. Now that the drug had FDA approval, marketing and\npostmarketing surveillance was heavy on the minds of both the research\nand marketing departments.\n\nThe two departments began a collaboration to follow the adoption of\nthe new drug. Marketing was eager to have high-volume prescribers adopt\nthe product, and the research department wanted to follow early reports of\npotential liver toxicity. Together they came up with a plan.\n\nMarketing already had access to the prescribing practices of most\nphysicians in the United States who saw patients for type-2 diabetes.\nIt proposed a phase 4 clinical trial, the industry term for postmarketing\nstudies to get prescribing physicians to report their experience with new\npharmaceuticals. Years ago, pharmaceutical manufacturers simply\npaid physicians to try new products with their patients. Now, however,\nthat was avoided since it appeared to interfere with the physician's\nclinical judgment and duty to prescribe what he or she believed best for\npatients.\n\nThe current plan would identify those physicians who were among the\ntop 10 percent of prescribers for type-2 diabetes. From among that group,\nseveral hundred physicians would be recruited to enter their patients into\na trial for whom the clinician had made a judgment that Compound 17392\nwas appropriate. Physicians who were already prescribing would not be\ninvited (since the manufacturer wanted each clinician to feel free to choose\nwhether to enter a patient into the trial). Following a protocol designed by\nthe research department, these physicians would report on a regular basis\nthe results of the use of the drug, reported side effects, and both patient and\nphysician subjective evaluations.\n\nPhysicians who were in the identified pool of prescribers would be in-\nvited to a two-day meeting to be introduced to the protocol. The meeting\nwould be held in Palm Beach, California, at an elegant hotel with golf\nprivileges included with the room. Those who were interested in the re-\nsearch would be paid $300 for every patient entered into the study, with an\nadditional payment of $300 for every patient who completed the one-year\nfollow-up. The payment was not a “finder’s fee” but rather compensation\nfor the time and effort involved in following the patients and filing reports.\nNo physicians who owned stock in the manufacturer would be allowed to\nparticipate (although ownership through mutual funds was acceptable).\n\nDr. Carlos Carera is a endocrinologist with a large practice in\nNew York City. He received an invitation in the mail to attend a two-day\nmeeting in Palm Beach to learn about a phase 4 clinical trial of a newly\napproved oral antidiabetic agent. He was not sure why he was selected,\nbut he had a large practice involving adults newly diagnosed with diabetes.\nSince some of his patients were not doing well on the available drugs or\ncould not tolerate them well, he was interested in these developments and\nwas considering whether to attend the meeting.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nIf Dr. Carera participates in the study and accepts $600 for his labor involved\nin recruiting and entering each patient into this trial, is his objectivity\ncompromised?\nEven if Dr. Carera can minimize the influence of the compensation, should he\nparticipate in the study?

    "case": "Case 16-9\nWaiving Consent for Future Research on Blood Samples\nIn Case 16-8 a manufacturer recruited high-prescribing clinicians to enter\ntheir appropriate patients into a postmarketing (phase 4) clinical trial that\nwould follow the use of Compound 17392, a new oral antidiabetic (hypogly-\ncemic) agent. Clinicians would recruit their patients, prescribe the new\ndrug, and follow the effectiveness of the drug as well as the side effects.\nPatients would be given a detailed written informed consent describing the\nrisks and benefits of the drug, potential side effects, any additional tests\nto be performed for the purposes of gathering research data (as opposed\nto tests needed for routine clinical care), and any additional burdens. The\nsubjects would also be told the purpose of the study, how confidentiality\nwould be protected, and what compensation, if any, would be provided for\npatients injured during the research.\n\nOne of the concerns of the drug company was that a small group of\npatients using Compound 17392 were showing abnormal liver function.\nSometimes these problems were self-correcting, but in some cases liver\ntoxicity was great enough that patients had to be withdrawn from the drug.\nSince only a small percentage of patients showed any liver problems,\ninvestigators wanted to see if they could understand the pathology. They\nbegan to suspect that a small group of patients metabolized the drug\natypically, perhaps as a result of some rare genetic variant producing a\nmodification in the metabolism. The research department at the drug com-\npany designed an additional study that would look at genetic markers in a\nblood sample from the patients. They also decided to store the additional\nblood for future research at a later time.\n\nThis research, like almost all clinical trials, must be reviewed and\napproved by an IRB. The board reviewing this study came to the consent\ndocument and faced a number of issues. Explaining the known risks in-\ncluding the slight chance of liver toxicity was straightforward. Similarly,\nalternatives to entering the research must be explained. Since this was not\na randomized trial, the IRB could avoid having to make sure the random-\nization process was explained adequately. Standard “boiler-plate” language\nabout the patient's right to withdraw, compensation for injury, and confi-\ndentiality was incorporated. Two issues presented a problem for the IRB.\nFirst, what should be said about the complicated financial arrange-\nment between the physician and the drug company? Patients could be told\nthat their physician was being paid to enter them into the trial and to have\nthem complete the trial. That could include the amount the physician was\npaid or merely a statement that a fee was provided.\n\nSecond, the collection of the blood samples presented challenging con-\nsent issues. Subjects would be told that a blood sample would be taken.\nThis would include standard language about the risks of venipuncture as\nwell as a statement that additional blood would be taken for research pur-\nposes. The problem was what to tell the patient/subjects about the tests\nand their results.\n\nStandard research consent includes a statement that subjects will be\ntold of any new developments that could be meaningful to them during the\nstudy, including new findings. In this case, however, since the liver pathology\nwas poorly understood, it was not clear what could be said about testing.\nMoreover, samples were being stored for future testing, which could occur\nat a time well after the patient had completed the trial, perhaps even after\nthe patient had stopped seeing the clinician involved.\n\nIt was assumed that nothing clinically meaningful would come from\nthese tests, but there was always a chance that the genetic tests could\nidentify a gene carried by a small group of people responsible for the liver\ntoxicity. Patients would surely want to know if they were carrying such a\ngene. It could be meaningful in future drug decisions. On the other hand,\nlearning that one has a gene responsible for unusual medical problems is\npotentially stigmatizing and could even lead to jeopardizing employment\nand insurance. If subjects were told that they had an unusual genetic\nvariation that led them to metabolize the drug atypically, would they have\nto tell this to health and life insurance companies when applying for\ninsurance?\n\nNot only was the disclosure of findings from these blood studies prob-\nlematic, informing subjects of the findings was also potentially very diffi-\ncult to carry out. If the findings occurred soon after completion of the study,\nthe researchers could notify the clinicians, who could inform and educate\nthe patients, but some of these studies occurred years later when the doctor-\npatient relation no longer existed.",

He had long been bothered by gastroeso-\nphogeal reflux disease (GERD). Reflux of gastric acid produces an unpleas-\nant sensation resulting from an improperly functioning sphincter between\nthe stomach and the esophagus that permits the upward flow of stomach\ncontents, especially gastric acid.\nMr. McBride's internist, William Arnold, had monitored the esophageal\nproblems for several years. Treatment had included antacids, histamine\nblockers (ranitidine or Zantac), and proton pump inhibitors including esome-\nprazole (Nexium). Dr. Arnold had noted increasing irritation of the lining of\nthe esophagus and the emergence of a condition known as Barrett's esopha-\ngus, in which some of its lining is modified with cells resembling intestinal\ncells replacing the normal tissue. This, in itself, is not harmful but is associ-\nated with the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of the\ncancer is at least 30 percent higher in people with Barrett's esophagus and\nperhaps as much as double. The patient's condition had progressed to the\npoint that it now involved severe dysplasia.\nMx. McBride's risk of developing adenocarcinoma remained small, less\nthan | percent, but the consequences would be severe. Dr. Arnold referred\nMr. McBride to Dr. Rachel Herbert, the chair of laparoscopic surgery at the\ncity's most prestigious teaching hospital. Dr. Herbert agreed with Dr. Arnold's\ndiagnosis. When the condition worsened, she recommended removal of the\nportion of the esophagus that manifested the abnormal cells. This would\nreduce the risk of the cells becoming cancerous. This was a major opera-\ntion but should result in an elimination or reduction of the risks associated\nwith Barrett's esophagus. She explained the risks and benefits. The proce-\ndure would be done laparoscopically, that is, using instruments that could\nChapter 17 Consent and the Right to Refuse Treatment 385\nbe passed through small slits in the skin, thereby making the intervention\nmuch less invasive. Dr. Herbert was one of the country’s most experienced\nlaparoscropic surgeons, having pioneered the techniques for several lapa-\nroscopic procedures. —\nShe had one concern about the consent for the procedure. Although she\nwas a world-class laparoscopic surgeon, most of her experience was in in-\ntestinal procedures and in sterilization of women who wanted their tubes\ntied using the laparoscopic technique. She had only performed two previous\nesophageal procedures laparoscopically. Thus, although she was a leading\nsurgeon, she was relatively new at this particular procedure. She feared that\ntelling Mr. McBride this would alarm him and could even drive him to con-\nsider alternatives, such as getting the operation done at another hospital.\nShe was convinced this was not in Mr. McBride’s interest. Although other\nhospitals had surgeons who might be more experienced at the esophageal\nprocedure, she believed her extensive experience with other laparascopic\nprocedures and the high quality of her hospital made it better for Mr. McBride\nto have her do the operation.

Lindbergh was listed\nin critical condition in the intensive care unit of John F. Kennedy Hospital in\nStratford, N.J. The brain damage was compounded by the fact that Lindbergh\nwent without breathing for approximately 15 minutes as rescuers tried to free\nhim from the wreckage.\nSomerdale detective Charles Pope said he arrived at the crash site five\nminutes after the accident occurred. \"He was more or less all mangled up\nunder the steering wheel,” said Pope. He said that after Lindbergh was re-\nmoved from the car his heart stopped beating and CPR was administered.\nReferring to his parents, who were called from Sweden to be at his side, Vicki\nSantoro, nursing supervisor at the hospital said, “They were just devastated.”\nFlyers’ team physician Edward Viner said that if Lindbergh's situation\ndoes not improve, the family will be left with a decision about how long to leave\nhim on the respirator.\n\n“He's a person that loves life,” [flyers Coach Mike] Keenan said of\nLindbergh.\nStratford, NJ Nov. 11 [Monday]—The injuries to Lindbergh ... left the\ngoalie brain dead. With cardiac stimulants and fluid replacement to keep his\nblood pressure up, Lindbergh was still alive tonight, but with no chance to\nsurvive. :\n\n“We simply now work with the family to decide how far they want to go\nin sustaining his biological life,” said Dr. Lewis Gallo, one of the hospital doc-\ntors assigned to the case. Withouta respirator, Gallo added, Lindbergh would\nstop breathing “in a matter of minutes.”\n\nViner said the respirator keeping Lindbergh alive would be discon-\nnected “as soon as they can come to grips with this as a family. ... I’m con-\ncerned about the father’s own health. He's not well and I understand he has a\nsignificant heart condition.”\n\nStratford, NJ, Nov. 12 [Tuesday]—Pelle Lindbergh, the Philadelphia Flyers\ngoalie who had been brain dead since a car crash early Sunday morning,\nwas declared dead tonight after surgeons removed all his oat organs for\npossible transplantation.\n\nLindbergh, 26, who suffered extensive brain and spinal injuries, was of-\nficially declared clinically dead Monday morning while his heart and lungs\nwere kept functioning only through the use of a respirator.\n\nTeam Captain Dave Poulin said, “If his organs can be donated that will\nhelp others and Pelle will live on.”",

    "case": "Case 18-2 ee\nAmbiguous Advance Directives: Who Interprets?\nThe following case was presented to a hospital ethics committee. The\npatient, Molly Murton, is a 74-year-old female first admitted to the hospi-\ntal in June with an acute cerebral vascular accident and currently has a\ndiagnosis of “multi-infarct dementia.” She has deteriorated since her first\nadmission and is now very weak, not coherent, and has to be spoon-fed\nby the nursing staff. She swallows poorly. The patient was transferred to\nthe acute hospital because of swallowing difficulties and aspiration\npneumonia on three occasions in the past year. Two years ago, the pa-\ntient made out a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPAHC)\nnaming her daughter, Helen, as the agent but making no other comments\non the form.\n\nA year later, one year before the present admission, she made out\nanother DPAHC, with a skilled care facility ombudsman in attendance, in\nwhich she again named her daughter as agent but also added on the form\nthat she wanted no efforts made to prolong her life, no CPR, and no feed-\ning tubes inserted. The patient was presumably considered competent\nwhen she signed the second DPAHC. Her daughter was not in attendance\nat the time.\n\nSubsequently, no feeding tubes were inserted despite three admis-\nsions for aspiration pneumonia. Now that she is having severe difficulty\nwith oral nutrition, her daughter, unwilling to see her mother suffer, has\ndecided she wants a gastrostomy tube inserted to decrease the likelihood\nof aspiration. She also indicated that if her mother develops pneumonia or\nanother potential fatal complication, she does not want her transferred to\nthe acute hospital. She wants her to be given comfort care in the skilled\ncare facility. The physician fully agreed with the daughter's decision.\n\nHowever, the administrator of the skilled care facility was uncertain that\nit was legal or ethical for the daughter to go against her mother’s expressly\nstated wishes not to have a feeding tube inserted. The insertion of the\ntube would be for the purposes of comfort and avoidance of aspiration\npneumonia but might potentially prolong her life, which had been objected\nto by the mother.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nSince Ms. Murton specifically stated that she didn’t want a feeding tube in her\nsecond version of her advance directive, should the physician follow the\ndaughter's request?\n\n| What should the ethics committee say to the skilled care facility administrator\nin response to his concerns?",

    "case": "Case 13-3\nThe Cruzan Case: Whether to Forgo Nutrition\nBased on a Patient’s Views\nAt 12:54 a.m., January 11, 1983, police were called to the scene of a single car\naccident. They arrived six minutes later and found Nancy Cruzan lying\nface down in a ditch thirty-five feet from her car without detectable cardiac\nor respiratory function. At 1:12 a.m., spontaneous cardiac and respiratory\nfunction was restored, but there had been significant anoxia for as much as\ntwelve to fourteen minutes.\n\nNancy was left with permanent brain damage, in a coma for three\nweeks. A gastrostomy was performed on February 7, consented to by her\n|\n(then) husband. Since then she had been at Mount Vernon State Hospital,\nfed entirely by gastrostomy tube. At the time of review of the case, she was\nnot on a ventilator, was oblivious to her environment except for reflexive\nresponses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli, and had a massive en-\nlargement of the ventricles of her brain that were filling with cerebrospinal\nfluid. The finding was that cerebral cortical atrophy was irreversible, per-\nmanent, progressive, and ongoing.\n\nThe highest cognitive brain function was exhibited by her grimacing,\nperhaps in recognition of ordinarily painful stimuli, indicating the experi-\nence of pain and apparent response to sound. She was described as a\nspastic quadriplegic with irreversible muscular contracture and tendon\ndamage in all extremities, no cognitive or reflexive ability to swallow food\nor water to maintain her daily essential needs. She was alive but in a per-\nsistent vegetative state (PVS). She could live for decades in this condition.\n\nBefore the accident she had expressed, “in somewhat serious conver-\nsation,” that if sick or injured she would not want to continue her life unless\nshe could live “halfway normally.” Her parents, Lester and Joyce, took over\nthe role of guardian and asked the Missouri courts for permission to termi-\nnate artificial hydration and nutrition.\n\nThe lower court supported their request, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed, arguing the state has an unqualified interest in life without regard\nto quality. This interest took two forms: (1) prolongation of life of individual\npatients and (2) interest in sanctity of life itself. Moreover, the case raises the\nquestion of how certain we must be of the patient's wishes. In this case, Nancy\nhad not explicitly stated she would refuse nutrition and hydration medically\nsupplied. The state noted how this case differs from other famous cases in that\nNancy was not a competent patient contemporaneously refusing treatment;\nshe did not have an advance directive, she was not terminal, the treatment\ncould not be a burden to her (since she was in a vegetative state), and this case\ninvolved nutrition and hydration rather than more complex treatments.»\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n» Why would artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently than other\nmore complex treatments?\nShould artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently?\n/Is a “somewhat serious conversation” enough evidence to discontinue life-\nsustaining treatment? Why or why not?",

    "case": "Case 18-4\nWithholding Chemotherapy for an Impaired Patient\nJoseph Saikewicz, a 67-year-old white male, was reported to have an Intel-\nligence Quotient (IQ) of 10 and mental age of approximately 2 years,\n8 months, but was otherwise in good health, strong, and well built. He was\nnot able to communicate verbally, using grunts and gestures instead. He\nhad been institutionalized in a state school since 1923 and at the Belchertown\nState School in Massachusetts since 1928. His only known family was two\nsisters who lived in California.\nOn April 19, 1976, Mr. Saikewicz was diagnosed as suffering from acute\nmyeloblastic monocytic leukemia. His physician proposed chemotherapy.\nChapter 18 Death and Dying 413\n\nIt was believed that, with chemotherapy, he had a remission chance of\n30-50 percent. If remission does occur it will typically last for two to thirteen\nmonths, possibly longer. The side effects include nausea, bladder irritation,\nnumbness and tingling of extremities, loss of hair, and bone marrow depres-\nsion. He would die in a matter of weeks or months without the chemotherapy.\nHe was not in pain.\n\nIt was agreed that most competent patients would elect to undergo\nchemotherapy, but Mr. Saikewicz was unable to understand what would be\ndone with him. The medical personnel envisioned that they would have to\nuse orderlies to hold him down on his bed while the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusions were administered. Thus, even though mentally normal\npeople would choose the therapy because they could understand the ratio-\nnale, for Mr. Saikewicz it would appear that his caregivers had turned on\nhim and were inflicting an unkind and painful assault.\n\nFor these reasons, his physician recommended that the chemotherapy\nbe omitted. It would offer, for him, more burden than benefit. The adminis-\ntrator of the school was not certain this was ethical or legal. In order to re-\nsolve the conflict, they asked for a judicial opinion on what to do.\n\nPerhaps because in the early part of the twentieth century families\nwere advised not to visit or bond with those placed in institutional facili-\nties, his sisters chose not to attend the hearing. Mr. Saikewicz was thus\nwithout any family or friends to assist except for the administrative and\nhealth care staff of the school. The issue was whether it was in Mr. Saikewicz’'s\ninterest, given his unique mental capacity, to receive the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusion.\n\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rendered an opinion that\ncalled into question the role of doctors, family, and hospital committees in\nmaking these decisions, stating: “We take a dim view of any attempt to\nshift the ultimate decision-making responsibility away from the duly es-\ntablished courts of proper jurisdiction to... the attending doctors, family,\nor hospital ethics committees.”\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nGiven these circumstances, what should be done for Mr. Saikewicz and who\nshould make the choice?\nHow does the doctrine of proportionality apply in this case?",

    "case": "Case 18-5\nPicking Parents to Make Good Medical Choices\nPhillip Becker was 12 years old in 1978 when critical medical problems\narose in his care. He had been born on October 16, 1966. He was determined\nto have Down syndrome, a congenital heart defect (a ventricular septal\ndefect), and elevated pulmonary blood pressure. With these problems he\n- would suffer progressive loss of energy and vitality until he is forced to\nlead a bed-to-chair existence.\n\nFor reasons that are unknown, when Phillip was an infant no action\nwas taken to correct his septal defect. In 1977, Dr. Gathman, a pediatric\ncardiologist, recommended catheterization to determine if an operation\nwould be appropriate at this late point for the septal defect. Phillip was\nreferred to second cardiologist who is less convinced than Dr. Gathman\nthat the procedure would help.\n\nPhillip's parents were told that the mortality risk from an operation\nwas between 5 and 10 percent and that children with Down syndrome\nhave higher-than-average risk. Without the operation he will face severe\nincapacitation. The longer the wait, the more risky the procedure will\nbecome. The heart must work three times harder than normal to supply\nblood. Without the operation he may live twenty more years. With it—if it\nis successful—he will live the life of a normal Down syndrome child,\nwhich, they were told, is less than a normal life span but clearly longer\nthan twenty years.\n\nConsidering all of the risks and benefits, Phillip’s parents refused the\noperation. They gave a range of arguments based on the welfare of child\nincluding the risk of immediate mortality, the pain and suffering from the\nsurgery, and the concern that they were responsible for Phillip’s welfare\nand that, if he outlived them, he could suffer from neglect from whoever\nwould end up caring for him. The court accepted the parental refusal on\nthese grounds.\n\nAlthough it had not been emphasized during the original court delib-\nerations, Phillip had been transferred to a residential facility called the\nWe-Care facility in 1972. It was claimed that the parents had been advised\nnot to remain emotionally close to Phillip in order to spare him the trauma\nof not being with them. ;\nA volunteer named Patsy Heath became involved and began to de-\nvelop a bond with Phillip. Eventually, he began making overnight visits to\nthe Heath household and was accepted as part of their family. The Heaths\nwere awarded guardianship on August 7, 1981, on the grounds that the\nHeaths were, de facto, the psychological parents and should have custody.\nIn doing so the second court was aware that the Heaths wanted Philip to\nundergo the operation.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nReview the reasons the Beckers refused the surgical procedure for Phillip. Do\nyou find the reasons sound or not?\nHow much, if at all, does the diagnosis of Down syndrome influence your view\nof whether the surgery should be performed or not?\nGiven that the Beckers thought surgical correction was not in Phillip’s interest\nand the Heaths thought it was, should custody be determined on the basis of\nwhich adults are making the most defensible choice for Phillip?'?",

    "case": "Case 18-6\nThe Case of the Suspect Surrogates\nTwo weeks before the Ethics Committee consultation at a hospital in Phila-\ndelphia, a 76-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital's emergency\nroom (ER), some three hours after having fallen and found to be uncon-\nscious. Only fragmentary history could be obtained. The family later was\nfound to be a local ex-husband, a sister with whom the patient lived, a\ndaughter in Boston, and a daughter in Ohio. Computer tomography (CT)\nscan of the head showed a subdural hematoma. The patient was taken to\nthe operating room after a delay of a couple of hours due to lack of avail-\nable room in the OR. During the operation, both a fresh subdural hema-\ntoma and a chronic subdural hematoma were removed. Postoperatively,\nthe patient has remained unconscious, attached to a ventilator through an\nendotracheal tube and fed by nasogastric (NG) tube. Though the patient\nhas remained comatose, by eleven days postoperatively the patient was\nable to be weaned off the ventilator and was breathing on her own through\nthe endotracheal tube.\n\nThe attending physician was able to get some additional history from\nthe daughter in Ohio. She indicated that the patient was disabled since a\nleft craniotomy fifteen years earlier for an auto-accident head injury. It is\nnot clear to what extent she was disabled; however, beginning in January\n1998, six months before the admission to the hospital, the patient was said\nto have begun failing, became confused and stopped reading newspapers\nand watching television. According to the Ohio daughter, the patient has\nbeen living with her sister who is said to be a drug addict and to have\nphysically abused the patient. The ethics consultation was called because\nof a conflict about what to do next. The pulmonary consultant had advised\nthat a tracheostomy be performed so that the endotracheal tube could be\nremoved. Also, consideration was being given to replacement of the NG\ntube with a gastrostomy tube for long-term nutrition. The attending physi-\ncian had talked with the neurosurgeon who felt that the patient would\nwake up. The neurosurgeon, however, did not indicate what he thought\nwould be the patient's functional deficit upon awakening. The attending\nphysician concluded that the tracheostomy should be performed and the\ngastrostomy tube placed. He then called and explained this information to\nthe daughter in Ohio. She expressed a strong desire directing the attend-\ning physician that no further treatment be given toward maintaining her\nmother’s life, including tracheostomy and tube feedings, if she were to\nremain in a vegetative state. She indicated that her sister in Boston would\nagree with her decision. The attending physician disagreed with the\ndaughter's feelings but was concerned about the ethical issues involved.\n\nThe patient had no Living Will or Durable Power of Attorney for Health\nCare. There was no evidence of the patient's own wishes. The ex-husband\napparently appeared once shortly after admission as a “courtesy call.” The\npatient's sister did not visit or communicate with the doctors. Neither of the\ntwo daughters traveled to the patient's bedside. In fact, the daughter in\nBoston could not be reached. The attending physician was aware that the\nOhio daughter had not seen her mother in at least three months; she did not\ncome now when her mother was critically ill and did not remove her from\nthe patient's sister, who the Ohio daughter herself had said was physically\nabusive to her.\n\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n) Is there a valid surrogate? Who?\nWhat do you think the ethics committee should say to the attending physician?\n+ Should the tracheostomy be performed and the gastrostomy tube inserted?",

He had been on dialysis for\nfour years and tolerated it well. Now, however, his disease had progressed\nto the point that he needed a blood transfusion to survive.
