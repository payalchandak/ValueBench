    "case": "Giving an example of my own might make things clearer. As a general practitioner I looked after a proud and private man who in his late sixties became seriously ill with lung cancer. (Rumour had it that he was one of the best diamond ‘fences’ in Europe, but that was not in the notes!). His wife called me after evening surgery to visit him at home. I found he had become suddenly jaundiced and very weak. A group of us had just opened a community hospital that was designed to provide good terminal care. As it was late at night and not much could be done then, I suggested I admit him to the new hospital. His wife was exhausted and keen on this plan. His pain and other symptoms were well controlled with medication. I came to say goodnight to him in the hospital and told him I was in a bit of a hurry but would see him in the morning. He gave me a look that I did not understand. In the morning I found that he had died quietly in the night.\n\nThe relatives, in spite of their grief, were pleased with his care and his peaceful end: but for me that look of his would not leave me, in some way I had let him down. I won’t ever know what the look was about, of course, or whether I had interpreted his glance correctly, but when I put myself in his situation, I began to see what might have been happening. I am sure he knew he was in his last hours, was surprised I did not know that (or did not tell him), and he wanted to talk about something important. He was alone, away from his family and the circumstances that he knew. There were no mobiles: perhaps he had no chance to deliver important final messages.\n\nI was left with disquiet. Nobody could fault my clinical care. I had acted entirely within the law. No one was making a complaint. I had used the hospital exactly as it was intended. And yet some part of my care had not been right. Discounting my own sadness – I liked him and we had worked hard together in his last illness – on a human level my care was defi- cient, because it had not crossed my mind that this might be his last night. Even a company telephonist is trained to ask, ‘Is there anything else I can help you with?’ It was the moral equivalent of the old surgical joke: the operation was successful but the patient died. The medical care was excellent but there was still something wrong, something that could have been done better, and I had to learn it.",

    "case": "CASE 1:\nPRINCIPLISM\nOphelia is a 27-year-old woman who has struggled with anorexia nervosa since she was 11\nyears old. She is extremely intelligent, and having gained a first class degree in history at\nOxford University, she is now halfway through her PhD. It is at times when her life is most\nstressful that she struggles with her anorexia. The first time she was admitted to hospital\nwas when she was 13. She was being badly bullied at school and had stopped eating in order\nto become thin to prevent being teased about being overweight. Being able to lose so much\nweight gave her the sense that she had some control over at least one aspect of her life.\nOphelia has spent the past 14 years in and out of hospital. On two occasions she had to be\nadmitted to intensive care as she had lost consciousness. During these admissions she was fed\nby a nasogastric tube. She also has a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and has been\nreceiving cognitive behavioural therapy. A year ago she had managed to stabilise her weight\nat 50 kg – she is 1.7 m tall. With the stress of her PhD and the breakdown of her relationship\nwith her boyfriend, when you initially see Ophelia she weighs less than 35 kg. Although you\nwant to feed her by nasogastric tube to prevent her needing a third admission to intensive\ncare, she adamantly refuses to have this. She tells you that she does not want to die, but nei-\nther does she want to be force fed. She is extremely frail and needs constant supervision by a\nhealthcare assistant. Due to a shortage of beds on the psychiatric ward, Ophelia is currently\nbeing nursed on a general ward. The older women in her bay are complaining about the\namount of personal attention she is receiving, as when they need assistance to change posi-\ntion or to go to the bathroom there is often a long wait due to staff shortages.\nQuestions\n• What is principlism?\n• How can the four principles be applied to this case scenario to offer guidance to the\ndoctor about whether Ophelia should be force fed?",

He is acutely unwell. Investigations reveal that\nhe has right lobar pneumonia. He also has dementia and ischaemic heart disease. Despite\nintravenous antibiotics and fluids, he does not make much improvement over the next few\ndays. He is lethargic, yet occasionally agitated and needs full nursing care. You decide to\ndiscuss his medical issues with his wife and son to see how they had been coping at home\nbefore the pneumonia.

He used to hold food in his mouth for long\nperiods of time before swallowing and had choked on several occasions. You decide to get a\nswallowing assessment. The speech and language therapist grades him as unsafe to swallow\nand he is made nil by mouth. A nasogastric tube is inserted so that he can continue to be fed\nbut he pulls it out on three occasions. He continues to deteriorate and his albumin drops due\nto sustained lack of intake. The only way to improve this would be to insert a percutaneous\nendoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, but you feel that in a patient with so many comorbidi-\nties this may not be in his best interests. You discuss the pros and cons of PEG feeding with\nthe patient’s relatives. You explain to them that without a PEG you can let him return home\nand continue to eat normally but that this may result in a fatal aspiration pneumonia at\nsome point. The alternative is a PEG tube and keeping the patient nil by mouth permanently.\nA PEG tube is associated with a mortality of 3% and serious complications. You inform the\nrelatives that the medical opinion of the team is to allow the patient to return home but that\nyou would be willing to consider a PEG if the family felt that the patient would continue to\nhave a good quality of life with one.\nQuestions\n• What is narrative ethics?\n• Which ‘voices’ should be listened to in this scenario?",

Subsequent tests indicate that he fell from his ladder\nbecause he suffered a massive myocardial infarction. He has yet to recover consciousness,\nand it is thought that he has had irreparable brain damage due to anoxia. He is married and\nhas three sons. His eldest son works as a radiographer in the hospital. His second son is an\nevangelist with the Pentecostal church, is married and has three young children.

Relatives of other patients are\ncomplaining about the lack of access to the family room and the noise levels. However, when\nthe senior staff nurse asks them to keep the noise down, Xavier’s son threatens the hospital\nwith legal action for religious discrimination.

Despite full active medical treatment and\nround-the-clock prayers, Xavier makes no improvement over the next 6 weeks.

Her parents are horrified by the idea that medical treatment could be\nwithdrawn from their child and are adamant that she continues to be ventilated. They have\nstrong religious beliefs, maintain that only God can decide when someone should die and are\npraying for a miracle to make her recover. Ayesha is their only child, her mother is 42 years\nold and this baby was much longed for after years of trying to conceive. They understand that\nshe is likely to be disabled but could not countenance ending her life and think that her life\nwill still be worthwhile if she is very severely impaired. The treating team feel it is wrong to\nprolong Ayesha’s suffering by continuing to ventilate her and to perform invasive and painful\nprocedures when her brain is known to be so severely damaged. Even if she might manage to\nbreathe on her own when she is a few days or weeks older, some think it would be kinder to\nwithdraw intensive care now, given how severely brain damaged she is likely to become.\nQuestions\n• Was it the correct decision to resuscitate Ayesha at birth?\n• Does Ayesha have a right to life?\n• When parents’ views conflict with doctors’, who decides what treatment is given to\na neonate?\n• What impact do parents’ religious beliefs have?\n• Does the financial cost of continuing intensive care make any difference to\nwhat should be done?",

The oncol-\nogist thinks it unlikely that the chemotherapy will provide any benefit, although he cannot\ncategorically say it will not keep Mrs Hauser alive for extra hours or days. He is aware she\nhad severe nausea the last time she had this chemotherapy and there is a risk it could actually\nmake her more unwell and hasten her death, as it can be damaging to the liver.\nQuestions\n• Is this ‘futile’ treatment?\n• Is it legal or ethical to provide or even offer treatment, purely for psychological\nbenefit, rather than physical benefit?\n• Is there a difference between giving the high-energy supplements and the chemo-\ntherapy if both are purely for psychological benefit?",

Six months ago Marjorie had\na much larger stroke due to infarction of the middle cerebral artery. Consequently she is now\nbed bound, doubly incontinent and has difficulty swallowing. Over the past 3 months there\nhas been minimal improvement in her condition and she has had to remain in hospital.\nAs an FY1 doctor, you are just starting your third rotation. On your first ward round you find\nthat Marjorie’s condition has deteriorated overnight. She is tachycardic and tachypnoeic with\na temperature of 38°C. You suspect she has developed bronchopneumonia. This is confirmed\nby a chest X-ray, and you decide that it would be best to start intravenous antibiotics and\nfluids. You discuss this with Marjorie’s family, but they are adamant that she would not wish\nto continue living in her current state as she would not consider her quality of life accept-\nable. Her daughter says that her mother had felt so strongly about this that she had made an\nadvance decision. She gives you a two-sided piece of paper which states ‘If, as a result of my\nillness, I become unable to perform any basic tasks myself, then I would not wish to receive\nany form of life-sustaining treatment’. It is signed ‘Marjorie Jenkins’ and dated 5 years ago.\nYou tell the family that antibiotic treatment is likely to cure Marjorie’s pneumonia but that\nshe is likely to die without it. However, they say that you should respect their mother’s wishes\nand that all treatment should be withheld except for pain relief.\nQuestions\n• What is an advance decision?\n• Is this advance decision valid and applicable to the circumstances?\n• If it is, do you have to follow it even if you do not think it is in the patient’s best\ninterests?",

    "case": "CASE 100:\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ILLNESS\nI was a final-year medical student when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the\nspace of 3 weeks I went from initial presentation at the general practitioner to disease diagno-\nsis, including grading and staging. Pretty impressive, considering this involved going for two\nconsultations (one with a hospital specialist), a blood test, chest X-ray, computed tomography\n(CT) scan, fine needle aspiration and biopsy under general anaesthetic. My world had been\nturned upside down.\nLooking back, the majority of those 3 weeks are a hazy memory. However, my first consulta-\ntion with the hospital specialist remains in my head, but for all the wrong reasons. Initially\nthere were no introductions, which meant I had no idea who anyone was. I remember there\nbeing another person in the room besides the doctor, my mother and myself. I assumed at\nthe time that she was a student nurse, but this is pure supposition based on my own experi-\nences as a student in outpatient clinics. I certainly was not asked whether I minded her being\npresent and she did not say or do anything to indicate that her being there was necessary. The\nconsultant appeared in a hurry and spent most of the consultation speaking to my mother\nabout everything that had happened, despite the fact that at 23, I was not only the patient, but\nalso a competent adult (and nearly qualified medical professional!).\nThe worst thing about the consultation was the provisional diagnosis. It was not broken to me\nin the way I would have expected. The consultant asked me what I thought was wrong with\nme. By that point, most differentials had been ruled out; the only one left was Hodgkin’s, yet\nstill I thought I was just being a hypochondriac. I made my suggestion and the consultant\nresponded, but not with the answer I’d been expecting: ‘Yes, I think it is Hodgkin’s too’. From\nthat point on, the rest of that consultation is a blur. I can’t remember any of the other informa-\ntion I was given; my mind had gone into overdrive and the only thing I could think was that I\nhad cancer and might die. A week later, after the diagnosis had been confirmed histologically,\nI went for CT staging. Again, I found this a terrifying experience. I was scared it might show\nthe cancer had already metastasised, but also of having the scan itself. Nobody had explained\nthe procedure to me – that I would need to be cannulated and have intravenous contrast\ninjected. By the time I got into the CT scanner, I was hysterically upset. A form was thrust\nat me, which I was asked to sign. To this day I have no idea what I signed for, whether it was\nto consent to the scan, confirm I didn’t have any allergies to iodine/ shellfish or to confirm\nI wasn’t pregnant.\nDespite having spent 2 years on hospital ward as a student, being an inpatient while I received\nchemotherapy was a completely different experience. It made me really think about what my\nown patients must have been going through. There are things that you don’t appreciate as\na student (and perhaps even as a junior doctor). Privacy was a big problem. I was paranoid\nabout sleeping since everyone would see me and possibly hear me snore. I was constantly\ntired as the nurses are always coming to do observations or give drugs. Machines bleeping\nconstantly were also a huge annoyance! I was also always asked about how I was feeling and\nabout my intimate bodily functions in front of an entire ward of patients and relatives. It was\nalso very lonely being a patient; I would see doctors on their rounds for less than 10 minutes\nand then speak to no one till visiting hours in the afternoon.\nI spent 6 months as a patient, and thankfully now I’m a doctor. But my experience was\nmore valuable than any lectures or clinics, since it made me think a lot about the way we treat\nour patients.\n\nQuestions\n• Should I have been treated quicker just because I am a medical professional?\n• Should the consultant have assumed I knew what all the investigations and treat-\nments involved?\n• Is informed consent ever possible when a patient is scared? Or in pain? Or in emer-\ngency situations?\n\n\n10 years later … An update\nTen years on and I still reflect on my own personal experience as a patient. I have no doubt\nthat it strongly influenced my career choice, as I now specialie in palliative medicine. I rec-\nognise and accept that unfortunately, despite our best efforts as medical professionals, some-\ntimes patients die. In a strange way, I think being forced to confront my own mortality has\nenabled me to reconcile the fact that patients die too. Being able to ease patients’ suffering\nand support them and their families at such a difficult time is both rewarding and extremely\nhumbling.\nWhat I learnt through personal experience is echoed time after time by the patients I care for.\nPatients value honesty and clear and timely communication from the medical team. Lack of\ninformation leads to a sense of loss of control and a negative patient experience. In any medi-\ncal condition, the patient has already lost a degree of control, so anything a doctor can do to\nimprove that perception is welcomed by patients.\nSometimes ‘being alongside’ the patient is enough. You may not have all the answers and you\nmay not be able to solve their problem or cure their illness, but being there for the patient and\nlistening to them goes a very long way, and often doesn’t take up as much of your time as you\nthink it will.\nKindness is one of the most valuable clinical skills you have. Patients appreciate empathy; if\nyou treat every patient as you would wish a close relative to be treated, then it’s difficult to go\nfar wrong.\nOne of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that the human spirit is amazing. Even in the face\nof adversity, people can show great strength and resilience. Patients can teach us a lot, not\njust about medicine, but also about life itself. As health professionals, we are very privileged\nindeed to be able to do the job we do.",
