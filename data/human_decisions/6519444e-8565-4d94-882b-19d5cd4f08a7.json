    "vignette": "A 37-year-old woman with unexplained infertility has tried to conceive for six years. She is using injectable gonadotropins with timed intercourse. Today’s ultrasound shows four mature follicles and several intermediate follicles. Her hormone levels are higher than typical for this protocol. This response raises concern for a multifetal pregnancy, which can increase maternal complications and preterm neonatal morbidity. Pregnancy is still uncertain, and some clinicians proceed in borderline cycles after counseling while others cancel to limit the chance of multiples. She says she accepts the possibility of multiples and, for religious reasons, would not consider selective fetal reduction. After reviewing the risks and alternatives, she requests proceeding tonight. Canceling would mean losing her last authorized, affordable cycle because her coverage ends next month and she cannot take more time off work until then. The ovulation trigger is due tonight. The IVF lab cannot accommodate conversion this cycle, and there is no time for additional monitoring or dose adjustment. Clinic policy and state law allow either approach in this situation.",
