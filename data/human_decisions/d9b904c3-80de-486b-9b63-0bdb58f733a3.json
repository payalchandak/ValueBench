    "vignette": "An 86-year-old man with no terminal illness requests physician-assisted dying. He is independent in daily activities and demonstrates decisional capacity. He consistently explains that long-held beliefs about dependence and loss of meaning make his ongoing life intolerable. Over the past year he tried a senior center and brief bereavement counseling but stopped, saying they worsened his distress. He will accept a one-time family meeting and home safety planning, but refuses ongoing therapy. He has set a date two weeks away and says he may attempt self-harm if you decline. He agrees he is not in immediate danger today and will remove lethal means and accept daily check-ins. In this jurisdiction, enduring existential suffering can meet eligibility if confirmed by psychiatry and two physicians. Hospital counsel affirms either proceeding or declining is permissible. Initiating could relieve his enduring suffering and reduce risk of a violent self-harm attempt. It also involves prescribing lethal medication and proceeding despite concern for potentially treatable depression or complicated grief. Declining avoids direct iatrogenic death and medication-related harms. It may prolong severe distress and leave him at higher risk of unsupervised self-harm. The required second physician can review this week, but will not assume care unless you initiate the process, and paperwork must be signed within days.",
