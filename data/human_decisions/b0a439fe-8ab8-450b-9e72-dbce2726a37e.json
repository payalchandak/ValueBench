    "vignette": "A 16-year-old with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieved remission after induction and consolidation. She is now starting maintenance therapy. Your center is enrolling patients in an IRB-approved trial comparing two commonly used maintenance durations, 2 years versus 3 years, using the same drugs and doses. Clinicians disagree about whether the added year meaningfully lowers relapse risk or mainly adds cumulative toxicity and disrupts adolescent development. Her mother provided permission and the patient assented. Randomization assigns her to 3 years. She says she would not have agreed if she knew she could be assigned longer treatment. She strongly prefers 2 years because ongoing fatigue, nausea, frequent clinic visits, and infection precautions are already straining school and friendships despite supportive care. You worry that pressing the longer plan could damage trust and adherence. You also worry that the trial is near its minimum enrollment target and is already underpowered, so post-randomization withdrawals could waste scarce research slots and funding and delay evidence that will guide care for many future leukemia patients. State law and hospital policy permit either continuing or withdrawing from research. Pharmacy needs the maintenance orders finalized before the next cycle.",
