    "vignette": "A 32-year-old man with profound intellectual disability lives in a long-term care facility. He is nonverbal with no known prior wishes, no family, and a court-appointed guardian. He is hospitalized with newly diagnosed aggressive acute leukemia with adverse features. Induction is unlikely to be curative, but it could produce a remission for months and allow return to his facility with fewer transfusions and fewer hospital transfers. It requires a central line and weeks of inpatient care with daily labs. He becomes agitated with procedures and may need limited 1:1 staffing or temporary safety measures to protect the line. Without induction, clinicians expect survival to be markedly shorter with rising risks of bleeding and infection that may be difficult to control in the facility despite transfusions.\n\nThe leukemia unit is at capacity with a waitlist for induction beds and 1:1 sitters. Blood products are also limited due to a regional shortage, and induction would require frequent transfusions. The team must decide within days because delay may make him too unstable for induction. Hospital policy and state law permit the guardian to consent to or refuse this treatment under a best-interest standard.",
