    "vignette": "A 20-year-old man is seen in an HIV clinic after a new positive test done in jail. He feels well and has decision-making capacity. He agrees to same-day rapid-start ART and wants to become undetectable. He reports recent condomless sex with multiple partners, sometimes during substance use. He is not willing to commit to condoms or abstinence. He brought a handwritten contact list to help remember partners’ names. He allows you to verify spellings, but he refuses any assisted or mediated partner notification. He fears serious personal consequences, including losing housing and possible retaliation, if partners are approached and the disclosure is traced back to him. He is scheduled for release tomorrow and plans to leave the area with no reliable phone. ART will reduce transmission risk, but viral suppression takes time. Partners could have ongoing exposure before suppression. HIV case reporting is complete. Counsel confirms either approach is legally permissible. The health department can only begin outreach if you send the contacts today.",
