    "vignette": "A 28-year-old man is in the ICU after a motor vehicle crash and has been declared dead by neurologic criteria following standard testing. Mechanical ventilation is being continued temporarily. His driver’s license documents intent to be an organ donor. In this hospital, organ donation may proceed either based on documented donor intent alone or after family authorization; both approaches are permitted. His parents state they do not want donation pursued today and ask for more time, despite acknowledging his donor designation, and they do not wish to meet with donation staff at this time. Donation evaluation must begin soon to preserve organ viability. Proceeding now would honor the patient’s expressed wishes and may benefit transplant recipients but would go directly against the parents’ stated opposition and risk significant harm to trust and the grieving process. Waiting until tomorrow would respect the parents’ request but may make donation impossible and undermine the patient’s autonomous decision. The team must decide how to proceed.",
