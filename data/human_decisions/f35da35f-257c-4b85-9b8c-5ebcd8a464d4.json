    "vignette": "A 38-year-old man with severe autism and profound intellectual disability is brought from his day program for acute behavioral dysregulation with unsafe elopement toward a busy street. He is nonverbal and cannot demonstrate understanding of admission or communicate a consistent choice. No legal guardian or prior documented preferences are available in the chart. His long-term foster carers cannot be reached until the morning. In the ED he is afebrile with stable vital signs. A brief exam shows no obvious trauma or intoxication, but pain, seizure, or medical delirium have not been excluded and labs and observation are pending. After a low-dose sedative and a quiet room, he is calmer but intermittently heads toward exits and becomes distressed with repeated redirection. The ED cannot provide overnight 1:1 observation. Observation status may not legally prevent him from leaving if he calms, increasing elopement and missed workup risk. A statutory involuntary hold would prevent leaving even when calm and provides due-process review, but typically requires locked-door detention and may involve restraints or IM medication. A 1:1 sitter is a limited resource needed for other high-risk patients. The team must choose a pathway tonight.",
