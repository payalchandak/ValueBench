    "vignette": "A 58-year-old woman with advanced, progressive multiple sclerosis and diabetic kidney disease is hospitalized for worsening uremia. She is intermittently confused and somnolent, and although she can answer some questions, the team is concerned she currently lacks full decision-making capacity due to uremia and hyperkalemia. She has a longstanding DNR/DNI and an advance directive that declined long-term dialysis, but it did not address a single emergency session. Today her potassium is markedly elevated with ECG changes. She has received IV calcium, insulin with glucose, and inhaled beta-agonist, but the effect is expected to be temporary. The team needs a plan during this shift. Nephrology can place a temporary dialysis catheter and start urgent hemodialysis today. A single session can potentially correct potassium, improve uremia, and may restore her decision-making capacity, but it could lead to ongoing dialysis dependence. Without dialysis, she is likely to die from recurrent hyperkalemia or arrhythmia within hours to days.",
