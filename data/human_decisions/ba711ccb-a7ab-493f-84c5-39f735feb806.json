    "vignette": "A 44-year-old woman is in outpatient psychiatry for her fourth visit. She reports two years of intrusive suicidal ideation that worsens during conflict at home. Today she denies intent to act and denies a near-term plan. She says she has access to lethal means at home but agrees to lock them away and complete a written safety plan. She is not intoxicated and has no psychosis. You judge her short-term suicide risk as moderate because of chronic suicidal ideation and access to lethal means, despite her denial of intent. She refuses antidepressants and declines voluntary ED evaluation, voluntary hospitalization, and an intensive outpatient program. She also refuses permission to contact her spouse or any other support person. She reports a prior involuntary hold as traumatic and says she may stop coming if it happens again. The visit is ending and you cannot arrange earlier follow-up or same-day mobile crisis. Hospital policy and state law allow either approach when imminence is uncertain.",
