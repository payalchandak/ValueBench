    "vignette": "A 27-year-old Black woman delivers her first child after an uncomplicated labor. The newborn is well. Both parents report sickle cell disease in close relatives and think they may carry the trait. They refuse the routine newborn blood spot screen for sickle cell status. They report prior involvement of child protective services and past discriminatory experiences. They fear that genetic results in the electronic record can trigger added CPS scrutiny or insurance or employment discrimination, which they believe disproportionately affects Black families. They accept standard exams and vaccines. You explain that many infants with sickle cell disease look well at birth. You note that the screen can be indeterminate and still needs confirmatory testing, but early knowledge can speed counseling, infection-prevention planning, and hematology follow-up. You also note that the state newborn screening program is designed to ensure all infants, especially those at higher risk, have equal access to early sickle cell interventions. The lab cannot hold or de-identify specimens, and results auto-populate the chart. The family plans to leave within hours to a remote area and will not return for outpatient testing soon. Hospital policy and state rules permit either honoring documented refusal or ordering the test over objection after rapid ethics review. Specimens must be sent before the next pickup.",
