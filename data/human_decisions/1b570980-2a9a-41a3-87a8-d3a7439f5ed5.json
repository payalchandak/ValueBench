    "vignette": "A 58-year-old man is admitted with improving community-acquired pneumonia. At shift change, the nurse reports brief central chest tightness with nausea that has now eased. His vital signs are stable and oxygenation is unchanged. The ECG is already ordered but will not print for about 10 minutes, and the nurse cannot start the chest-pain protocol without a physician order. He does not meet criteria for a rapid response call. No other doctor is on the ward, and the on-call registrar is reliably expected within 5–10 minutes. You are the outgoing junior doctor. You are markedly fatigued and past duty hours, and you will be hard to reach once you leave. If this is acute coronary syndrome, even a short delay in antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and monitoring could increase the risk of infarct extension, malignant arrhythmia, or death. Activating the protocol would also trigger continuous monitoring and possible transfer. Telemetry beds and transfer capacity are near capacity, so activation would likely consume a scarce resource. The treatment could expose him to harm if symptoms are non-cardiac and assessment is mistaken. Hospital policy and counsel confirm that either immediate initiation or documented deferral with prompt handover is acceptable for a stable patient.",
