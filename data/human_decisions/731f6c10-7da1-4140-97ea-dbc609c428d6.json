    "vignette": "A 62-year-old man is admitted for jaundice. Endoscopic biopsy of a pancreatic mass shows adenocarcinoma. He is medically stable, alert, and demonstrates decision-making capacity. He has repeatedly asked you to review the biopsy results today and states he wants to know them even if his brother cannot be present. Over the last 24 hours he has had two witnessed panic episodes with hyperventilation and near-syncope that required PRN lorazepam and a temporary 1:1 sitter. You are concerned that immediate disclosure could precipitate another severe episode with risk of injury or need for restraints. Earlier in the admission he told a nurse he wanted his brother present for bad news. A family meeting is scheduled late this afternoon and is the only time his brother can attend before the patient is transported early tomorrow for staging imaging that requires informed consent. Psychiatry cannot evaluate him until tomorrow morning. Delaying disclosure may postpone consent, staging, and treatment planning. Risk management notes that either immediate disclosure or a documented short delay for acute safety with disclosure within 24 hours is permissible.",
