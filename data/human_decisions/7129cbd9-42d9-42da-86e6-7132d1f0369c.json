    "vignette": "A 68-year-old man with long-standing paranoid schizophrenia and diabetes is admitted with rapidly worsening necrotizing infection and osteomyelitis of the left foot and ankle. He is febrile and hypotensive despite IV antibiotics and repeated bedside debridement. Vascular surgery says a below-knee amputation could control the source. He is septic with poor circulation, and the stump may not heal. He may need prolonged ventilation and could still die. The ICU team believes he is unlikely to survive without definitive source control in the next day or two. He refuses amputation. He can describe that he could die without surgery and that he would lose the leg with surgery. He insists staff are part of a plot to “harvest” him. He also cites a lifelong religious belief that major body parts must remain intact, confirmed in old clinic notes. Psychiatry and the surgical team disagree on whether fixed delusions prevent him from applying the information to himself. He has no surrogate or advance directive, and he will likely need sedation within hours. Emergency court review is not feasible. Proceeding over objection would require treating him as lacking decision-making capacity, while not amputating would treat him as having capacity and honor his refusal and religious objection.",
