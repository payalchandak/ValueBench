    "vignette": "A 15-year-old girl is seen in your adolescent medicine clinic with both parents. Her father has Huntington’s disease and has early symptoms. She requests predictive testing before moving for a new school term in three weeks. She reports panic, insomnia, and falling grades from the uncertainty. Her parents support the request and are willing to provide consent. She has a past episode of depression but denies current suicidal thoughts. You assess her as able to explain the test, its limits, and possible long-term consequences. Her mental health clinician expects that having a result could substantially reduce her current symptoms and help her plan supports for the move. A positive result would not change medical care now. Early testing may also cause lasting anxiety or depression, regret, or stigma and discrimination. If testing is deferred, her current symptoms may persist and worsen school functioning. The regional genetics service discourages testing under 18 but will consider a mature-minor exception with a physician’s order today. If you do not submit it now, testing is unlikely for at least a year due to transfer of care and insurance change.",
