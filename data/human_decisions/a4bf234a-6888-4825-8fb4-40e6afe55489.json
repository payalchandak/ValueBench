    "vignette": "A 28-year-old healthcare assistant presents to occupational health for unit-specific clearance today. She works on a cardiology step-down unit where many patients are at high risk for respiratory complications and often cannot mask. The hospital is under a temporary infection-control directive after a recent influenza-like illness cluster on the unit. She declines the influenza vaccine. She is offered vaccine declination under policy and is informed that declining may require temporary reassignment during outbreaks; she still refuses. Policy and the union agreement allow declination with added precautions, and they also allow occupational health to restrict staff from high-risk units and arrange reassignment during an outbreak; counsel confirms either approach is legally permissible. Masking and symptom screening reduce risk but are not fully protective. The unit is already critically understaffed. Reassigning her would require mandatory overtime for the remaining staff and raise the risk of fatigue-related errors. No additional float or replacement staff are available without pulling from other understaffed services. The director wants a decision before finalizing this week’s schedule.",
