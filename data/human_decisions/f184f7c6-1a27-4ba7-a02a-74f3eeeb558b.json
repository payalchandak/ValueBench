    "vignette": "A 36-year-old man is in the ICU after a motorcycle crash. He has a non-survivable traumatic brain injury. Death is determined by neurologic criteria per protocol, including apnea testing. He remains on the ventilator only for organ support. The organ procurement organization reports he is listed as a donor in an out-of-state registry entered over a decade ago. \nHis parents adamantly oppose organ recovery. They claim that while he may have signed up a decade ago, he \"wouldn't have wanted this\". However, they cannot provide any evidence (such as recent conversations, written notes, or registry withdrawals) to support a change of heart. The OPO says recovery must start within two hours. Several candidates are actively waiting tonight, including a status-1 liver recipient. If recovery is delayed, organs will become nonviable and recipients may die waiting. Hospital counsel confirms that either proceeding or standing down is legally permissible here.",
