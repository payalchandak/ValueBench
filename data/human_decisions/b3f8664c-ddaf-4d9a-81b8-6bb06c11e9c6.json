    "vignette": "A 30-year-old woman with known HIV returns after years without care. She has oral candidiasis and unintentional weight loss. She is afebrile and comfortable. She denies dyspnea, severe headache, focal neurologic symptoms, or confusion. Faxed records show prior advanced immunosuppression with a CD4 count below 50 and panic attacks after distressing medical discussions, including an ED visit. She arranged childcare for one hour and asks you not to discuss prognosis or “how bad it is” today. She says she will not agree to blood draws unless you explain in detail what tests could show and what the results would mean, even if that discussion increases her anxiety. Baseline staging labs today would guide ART timing, opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and urgent screening for occult infections such as cryptococcal disease. Delaying labs for several days could postpone this planning and miss a treatable complication. The clinic social worker can meet with her only in 72 hours, which may reduce panic and improve follow-up. Hospital policy allows either proceeding today or deferring with documented refusal.",
