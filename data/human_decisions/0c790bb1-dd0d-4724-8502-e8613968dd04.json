    "vignette": "A 28-year-old woman with chronic migraine enrolled in your optional research study that included ApoE genotyping. The consent said results are usually not returned, but participants may be contacted if a finding seems important. It did not define which findings qualify. Her research-grade report shows an ApoE variant associated with increased Alzheimer risk, but it does not predict whether she will develop dementia. There is no proven prevention plan based on this result alone. She recently asked whether genetics could affect her plans to start a family and to join a prevention registry. She says she wants to know any relevant genetic findings before she moves tomorrow. Her chart notes episodes of health anxiety after unexpected test results. Confirmatory clinical testing and genetic counseling cannot be arranged before she leaves. She has declined portal messaging and you will not have reliable contact after today. Without learning this now, she may make near-term family-planning or registry decisions without the information and later feel harmed or misled. The IRB-approved protocol and institutional policy allow clinician discretion to disclose or not disclose with documentation.",
