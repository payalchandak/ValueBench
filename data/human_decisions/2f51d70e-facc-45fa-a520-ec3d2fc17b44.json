    "vignette": "An 8-year-old child is seen in primary care for prominent auricles and school-related distress after repeated peer comments about his ears. His parents request elective otoplasty. He is developmentally typical and can meaningfully assent or withhold assent. He says he wants the teasing to stop. He is scared of anesthesia and does not want his ears touched now. He is otherwise healthy, with no hearing concerns. The GP reviews that otoplasty is elective. It can cause pain, infection, scarring, visible asymmetry, or later revision, and it may not end teasing. A family history of keloid scarring raises concern about cosmetic outcome. Otoplasty can improve self-esteem for some children with prominent ears. The school will start an anti-bullying plan. A child psychologist can see him within two weeks, but the impact on distress may take time and is uncertain. A visiting surgeon has limited clinic slots this month, shared across children including medically necessary cases. Otherwise the earliest consult is about a year. The GP must decide today whether to refer now or defer referral.",
