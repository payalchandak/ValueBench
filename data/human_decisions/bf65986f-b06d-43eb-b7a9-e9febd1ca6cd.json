    "vignette": "A 38-year-old woman is seen in outpatient psychiatry for escalating workplace conflict and longstanding suspiciousness. Over four visits you have documented prominent paranoid personality traits, rapid anger when feeling criticized, and a prior episode in which she filed multiple retaliatory complaints after reading a critical evaluation. Today she arrives upset but becomes calm during the visit. A focused suicide risk assessment finds intermittent passive death wishes without intent, plan, or preparatory behavior, and she agrees to a safety plan and follow-up. She demands to log into the patient portal and read your signed progress notes alone before leaving. She refuses an in-session note review and says any delay will be “proof” you are hiding misconduct. The note includes your impression of \"paranoid traits,\" descriptions of tense interactions, and collateral details from her HR file. Similar unsupervised access to critical documentation has previously led to marked escalation, including retaliatory actions and worsening suicidal thoughts. You believe reading these notes now is likely to acutely worsen her paranoia and anger and increase risk of self-harm or retaliatory behavior. She also needs documentation for an HR grievance due tomorrow. IT cannot provide supervised or partial access, and the note is locked unless you place a time-limited hold. Your clinic generally provides same-day note access to all patients to support equitable transparency. Compliance confirms either approach is permissible under policy and applicable law. A brief clinical summary would meet the HR deadline while reducing the chance of destabilization and therapeutic rupture.",
