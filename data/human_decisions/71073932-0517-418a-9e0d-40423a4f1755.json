    "vignette": "A 26-year-old graduate student is in outpatient psychotherapy for severe major depression. Today he reports persistent homicidal ideation toward an identifiable former partner. He names her but gives no time or place. He denies intent to act, denies substance use, and has no history of violence. He reports recently acquiring a weapon and says he could access her when she returns to campus for classes tomorrow. He explicitly refuses you contacting campus security or the former partner. He says he will leave immediately and will not go for emergency evaluation if confidentiality is not maintained. He refuses hospitalization and says any disclosure will end treatment and likely trigger campus discipline and loss of his student visa. The former partner is also a student and is unaware of the risk, so she cannot take precautions unless informed. You can offer a same-day emergency psychiatric evaluation, but mobile crisis cannot arrive before he leaves, and in your jurisdiction an involuntary hold requires stated imminent intent, which he continues to deny. Clinic leadership confirms that either urgent escalation of care with confidentiality or a limited protective disclosure is legally permissible. You must decide before he leaves the office.",
