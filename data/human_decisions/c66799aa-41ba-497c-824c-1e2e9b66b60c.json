    "vignette": "A 12-year-old boy is seen with his mother for a brief post-hospital follow-up after abdominal pain; symptoms have resolved. His exam again shows severe pediatric obesity with stage 1–2 hypertension, without headache, chest pain, or other end-organ symptoms. When weight is mentioned, he becomes visibly panicked and hyperventilates. He says he was recently bullied at school and asks not to discuss weight today. He asks to speak privately, but his mother insists you tell him to diet and refuses to step out. In the hospital he had panic symptoms when staff discussed his size, and his mother reports he sometimes skips meals afterward. Screening questions raise concern for emerging disordered eating behaviors. He has acanthosis nigricans, and hospital labs showed worsening ALT compared with prior records, suggesting evolving metabolic disease. The family drove several hours and is unlikely to return for 6–12 months. The clinic cannot provide telehealth, and the family does not reliably use phone or portals. Pediatric guidance supports addressing obesity over time but allows deferring sensitive counseling when distress or eating-disorder risk is a concern. Deferring counseling today may delay evaluation of progressive metabolic disease; initiating counseling may worsen panic or disordered eating. You have only a few minutes to decide what to do next.",
