    "vignette": "A 7-year-old girl is brought from a school trip after a fall onto her wrist. X-rays show a displaced, comminuted distal radius fracture. She is neurovascularly intact. Pain improves with IV analgesia, but the deformity remains. The orthopedist recommends reduction soon because delay until tomorrow afternoon may make closed reduction harder due to swelling and can increase long-term stiffness or need for open reduction. ED procedural-sedation staff are not available overnight, so the plan is closed reduction and casting in the operating room under anesthesia. The teacher has a permission form for routine care that excludes anesthesia and is not a legal guardian. You have tried both parents, listed emergency contacts, and the school administrator, and no one is reachable. Overnight splinting and analgesia are feasible but will not correct displacement. An OR team is available now; the next slot is tomorrow afternoon. Hospital policy and counsel advise that either proceeding under an urgent-treatment exception with documentation or waiting for parental consent is legally permissible. You must decide tonight.",
