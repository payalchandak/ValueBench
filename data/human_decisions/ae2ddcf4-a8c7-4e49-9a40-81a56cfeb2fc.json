    "vignette": "A 35-year-old woman is in the ICU after a massive intracranial haemorrhage. She conceived with IVF after infertility and was 23 weeks pregnant when she was found unresponsive. Death by neurologic criteria has been confirmed by two physicians per protocol. She has no written advance directive, and her spouse is the legal surrogate. Ultrasound shows a reassuring fetal heart rate and no anomalies. Neonatology says a live birth would require weeks of physiologic support and the neonatal outcome is uncertain. The spouse requests continued ventilation and escalating ICU interventions and reports the patient had explicitly stated that if she were declared brain-dead while pregnant, she would want life support continued for fetal benefit. Her sister recalls a general wish to avoid prolonged machine support, but they never discussed pregnancy or neurologic death. Ongoing interventions cannot benefit the patient and would require vasopressors, transfusions, invasive lines, and possibly dialysis, with rising risks of infection and bleeding. If support is withdrawn, fetal demise is expected within minutes to hours. The ICU is at capacity and blood products are limited. You must decide today whether to escalate or withdraw.",
