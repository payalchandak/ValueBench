    "vignette": "A 28-year-old woman is 12 weeks pregnant with her first child. She and her partner both have achondroplasia. They request chorionic villus sampling with targeted FGFR3 testing. You explain that two pathogenic variants are typically lethal shortly after birth, one variant causes achondroplasia with long-term survival, and no variant predicts average stature. They would continue the pregnancy if the fetus has achondroplasia. They would end the pregnancy if the fetus is biallelic (lethal) or has no FGFR3 variant (they say they believe they will connect better to a child that is similar to them). CVS carries a small risk of pregnancy loss, and they accept this risk for timely, actionable results. Results would return while first-trimester termination is still possible, but only if referral is placed now. State law and hospital policy permit both testing and elective termination. Hospital policy requires the ordering clinician to place any requested termination referral to preserve equal access to time-sensitive care. Otherwise you must transfer care. The nearest alternate provider is hours away and cannot see her before the cutoff. Transfer would likely force continuation of a lethal pregnancy or a later, higher-risk procedure. You have a serious moral objection to facilitating termination of an unaffected fetus.",
