    "vignette": "A 48-year-old woman with metastatic breast cancer and brain metastases is bedbound and receives tube feeds after recent neurologic decline. She cannot speak full sentences. She consistently answers yes/no. She understands the plan and demonstrates decision-making capacity. She is due for an inpatient chemotherapy infusion in 48 hours. She clearly indicates today that she wants to proceed and does not want to switch to a comfort-only plan. Two months ago, the same regimen led to temporary tumor shrinkage and fewer headaches. Oncology advises that any further symptom stabilization is uncertain and likely limited. The last cycle caused severe nausea and confusion, and her liver tests are now borderline. There is concern for serious toxicity, hospitalization, or sedation that could reduce her remaining alert time. If chemotherapy is canceled, her headaches and neurologic symptoms are expected to worsen within weeks despite steroids and opioids. The drug is compounded off-site in a fixed dose and must be authorized today. It cannot be delayed, modified, or replaced in time. The hospital is experiencing a temporary shortage of this medication. Palliative care is already involved either way. Hospital policy and state law allow either proceeding or canceling in this setting.",
