    "vignette": "A 27-year-old woman with HIV is 18 weeks pregnant and comes to prenatal care with her male partner. She is usually engaged in care but recently missed doses, and her last viral load was detectable. She has not told him her diagnosis. They have condomless sex, and she says he wants to try to conceive again soon. She reports concern for retaliation if he learns her status, though she describes no prior physical assaults. A social worker is available today, but she refuses assisted disclosure. She asks you not to imply HIV or recommend testing without a specific concern. Local law and hospital policy permit either approach.",
