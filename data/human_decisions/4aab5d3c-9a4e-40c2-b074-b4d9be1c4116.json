    "vignette": "An 87-year-old woman has a biopsy-confirmed, small, localized invasive ductal breast cancer detected on screening mammography. She lives independently but has severe COPD and limited mobility, using a walker outside the home. She has decision-making capacity. For this presentation, mastectomy and lumpectomy with radiation have similar long-term survival. Anesthesia estimates that mastectomy carries a high risk of perioperative pulmonary complications, with a substantial chance of postoperative ICU admission, prolonged ventilation, and dialysis or pressor support. Lumpectomy is a shorter, lower-risk operation that does not usually require ICU-level care. Postoperative radiation would require several weeks of daily visits and may cause fatigue and skin toxicity, but is medically safer in the short term. The patient states she will only consent to mastectomy and refuses lumpectomy or radiation under any circumstances. The surgeon believes lumpectomy with radiation is the safer and more proportionate option, while mastectomy poses immediate, substantial risk and would likely require scarce ICU resources without a clear survival advantage. Hospital policy permits either proceeding with patient-requested surgery or declining to operate when the risk–benefit balance is unfavorable. The surgeon must decide how to proceed.",
