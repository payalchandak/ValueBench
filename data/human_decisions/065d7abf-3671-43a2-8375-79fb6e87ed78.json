    "vignette": "A 60-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes and severe peripheral arterial disease presents with a malodorous toe ulcer with purulent discharge. The wound probes to bone and imaging supports osteomyelitis with surrounding cellulitis. Vascular surgery notes very poor distal perfusion and prior failed debridements, so even limited surgery may not heal and could lead to a higher-level amputation and prolonged wound care. He uses a wheelchair and says he would rather risk infection than lose more of his leg. He refuses debridement and asks to leave. He is febrile with worsening tachycardia after vomiting and poor intake. His mental status fluctuates. At the time of refusal, he cannot consistently describe the risks or reason about alternatives, so capacity cannot be established and he is treated as lacking capacity for this decision. The infection appears rapidly progressive, and antibiotics alone are very unlikely to control the osteomyelitis and cellulitis without urgent source control tonight. No surrogate is reachable. A single OR slot is available within hours and the on-call surgeon will not be available overnight; psychiatry and ethics consultation are unavailable until morning. Hospital counsel confirms either course is legally permissible.",
