    "vignette": "A 7-year-old boy presents 45 minutes after a fall with a full-thickness laceration through the upper lip crossing the vermilion border. There is mild dirt contamination but no tissue loss, avulsion, oral commissure involvement, facial nerve deficit, or parotid duct concern. His tetanus shots are up to date. He is stable but very anxious and will likely need procedural sedation for a careful layered closure. No in-house ENT or oral surgery coverage is available tonight. You are the on-call general surgeon and are credentialed and experienced in layered lip repairs. Either you or a plastic surgeon can achieve an acceptable functional repair. Plastics may offer a modest cosmetic advantage and a lower risk of vermilion misalignment or noticeable scarring. A plastic surgeon is available from home and can arrive in about an hour. Waiting means prolonged fasting and distress. It also increases swelling and may require deeper sedation. The on-call plastic surgeon is also covering multiple facilities and other emergencies, and activating after-hours call-in uses limited specialist resources and overtime costs that can delay other patients’ care. Hospital policy and state law permit either plan with parental consent. The parents want the best appearance but also want the repair done soon.",
