    "vignette": "A 78-year-old man with moderate dementia is hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia and delirium and cannot make medical decisions. Before this illness, he repeatedly told his family that he wanted to avoid extreme medical measures, restraints, or prolonged suffering, even if that meant a shorter life.\nHe can no longer swallow safely. Doctors can place a PEG (feeding tube through the stomach), but because he pulls at medical lines, doing so would likely require physical restraints or sedating medications, directly conflicting with his stated wishes. PEG placement could prolong his life and allow transfer to a nursing facility while awaiting possible recovery of swallowing function.\nIf a PEG is not placed, he can be fed small amounts by hand for comfort, accepting that he may receive inadequate nutrition and die sooner. This approach would require prolonged hospitalization with one-to-one nursing care, using limited hospital resources that would otherwise be needed for other seriously ill patients awaiting admission.\nThe medical team must decide how to proceed.",
