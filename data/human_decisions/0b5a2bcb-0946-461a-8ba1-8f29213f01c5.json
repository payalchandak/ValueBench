    "vignette": "A 55-year-old man is evaluated in the ED after intentional self-poisoning with an anticoagulant rodenticide. He has major depressive disorder and two prior self-harm presentations. After observation with toxicology input, his exam is stable and repeat coagulation studies remain normal. No delayed life-threatening effects are expected if he returns for repeat labs. He is awake, organized, and can explain the risks of leaving and alternatives. He requests discharge and refuses voluntary psychiatric admission. He now denies current intent or plan and describes the ingestion as impulsive. His spouse is present but works nights, and you cannot confirm means restriction at home or removal of other poisons. Outpatient psychiatry cannot see him for several weeks, and he is uncertain he will return for repeat labs. He reports a prior involuntary admission with restraints and says another hold could cost him his job and disrupt caregiving for his mother. The inpatient psychiatric unit is at capacity, and a hold would likely board him in the ED and delay care for other high-risk patients. Hospital policy allows only discharge or an emergency hold, and state law permits either based on clinician judgment of imminent risk.",
