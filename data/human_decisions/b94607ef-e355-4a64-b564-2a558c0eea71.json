    "vignette": "A 14-year-old boy is on an adolescent psychiatry unit for severe behavioral dysregulation and is diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. He is in seclusion after repeated assaultive behavior toward staff. For the past 48 hours he has taken only a few supervised sips and has refused meals. When drinks or food are brought into the room he sometimes grabs and throws them, and staff have been struck during attempts to retrieve items. He is awake and oriented but highly impulsive. He repeatedly states he will not drink or eat even if it makes him sick. The team is divided about whether he can meaningfully refuse hydration right now. Nursing notes dry mucous membranes and increasing dizziness on standing, though vital signs remain acceptable. His legal guardian is reached by phone and asks staff to avoid force unless medical deterioration is clear. Risk management has approved only two overnight protocols with current staffing. A plan is needed before the night shift.",
