    "vignette": "A 56-year-old man is seen in neurology for two years of worsening memory, wide-based gait, and new urinary urgency with incontinence. MRI shows findings consistent with NPH. He can explain the purpose and risks of a shunt in his own words. He gives a stable reason for refusal, citing a longstanding aversion to implanted devices, but he is intermittently disoriented and cannot describe how refusal affects his fall and driving risks. He refuses admission in any setting. His spouse is the usual surrogate but is reluctant to consent against his stated wishes, and asks you to help her decide. Involuntary admission could require restraints or sedation and may trigger delirium and lasting loss of trust. Honoring refusal is expected to forgo potential benefit. Hospital counsel confirms that either course is legally permissible.",
