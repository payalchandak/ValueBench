    "vignette": "A 34-year-old woman with a renal transplant 3 years ago requests embryo transfer after IVF for longstanding infertility. She now has stable graft function with no recent rejection. Her blood pressure is controlled on medication. Her ovarian reserve has been poor despite high-dose stimulation, and this cycle yielded only two borderline-quality blastocysts. Both embryos have been thawed for transfer and cannot be refrozen, so they must be transferred within hours or discarded. She strongly prefers transferring both to maximize the chance of pregnancy now because she may not be medically able or financially covered to attempt another cycle. Transplant nephrology and maternal–fetal medicine have counseled that a twin gestation would increase the risk of severe pre-eclampsia, preterm delivery, and graft loss. Hospital policy and state law permit either transfer plan with informed consent.",
