    "vignette": "A woman in her 70s with end-stage pulmonary fibrosis is seen on an urgent home visit for acute worsening dyspnea. She can only speak in short phrases. Her SpO2 stays low despite her usual home oxygen regimen and nebulizers. She is febrile with a new cough, raising concern for a potentially reversible infection or mucus plugging on top of her chronic disease. Earlier today, while still clearly alert, she said she would accept a short ICU “trial,” including possible intubation, if there were a reversible problem, but she did not want prolonged life support. There is no POLST or written directive. Over the next hour she becomes drowsy and intermittently confused, and you cannot reliably confirm her wishes. Her family requests full life-prolonging treatment if she worsens, and no one is clearly designated as surrogate. Prior pulmonology notes state that if she is intubated, liberation from the ventilator would be unlikely given her baseline disease. The ICU is near capacity and a ventilator would be a scarce resource. If she stays home, she could die within hours to days, and you have limited medications to control severe air hunger.",
