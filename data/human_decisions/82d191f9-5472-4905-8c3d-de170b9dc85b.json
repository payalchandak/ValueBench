    "vignette": "A 32-year-old woman is in the trauma ICU after a motor vehicle crash. She has been intubated for several days. She remains unable to follow commands when sedation is lightened. The team anticipates prolonged ventilatory support. By tomorrow, they must decide whether to proceed with tracheostomy and feeding tube placement or continue endotracheal ventilation for a short, time-limited period and reassess. Both options are medically reasonable but differ in invasiveness and long-term burden. She has no advance directive and no documented proxy. Her husband is reachable and requests to serve as surrogate. He says he knows her preferences from prior hospitalizations. Her parents report a recent separation and alleged intimate partner violence. A prior emergency visit note documents suspected IPV involving the husband. The parents report she previously told them she would want them, not her husband, to make decisions if she lacked capacity. The IPV concern raises safety and coercion risks if the husband controls consent and access. Hospital policy prioritizes a spouse but allows an alternate-surrogate process when there is credible concern about appropriateness. The hospital has applied this process inconsistently in IPV-suspected cases, raising fairness concerns. Counsel confirms either route is legally permissible. A court-appointed guardian cannot be obtained in time, and the ICU requires one surrogate to consent now.",
