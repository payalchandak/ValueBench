    "vignette": "A woman in her early 50s with progressive multiple sclerosis is admitted to the high-dependency unit with depressed consciousness after suspected ingestion of acetaminophen and opioids. She is wheelchair-dependent and needs help with most daily care, but she had been communicating reliably before this event. She was intubated on arrival before staff could locate her paperwork. Two years ago, during a neurology admission, she signed a witnessed advance decision refusing CPR and “ICU ventilation and other invasive life support” if her MS reached a stage of irreversible decline; she described wanting to avoid prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy. The document does not mention self-poisoning or short-term treatment for an acute, potentially reversible illness. She now has worsening liver injury. Clinicians think she has a good chance of hepatic recovery with immediate antidotal therapy and organ support, but deterioration could still lead to a prolonged ICU course with ongoing invasive support. Her husband asks for extubation based on the document. Her adult daughter says her mother recently discussed an upcoming family milestone and would accept brief ICU care for reversible problems. Local policy permits temporary life-sustaining treatment while applicability is clarified, and permits withdrawal if it is judged applicable. The physician must decide within hours.",
