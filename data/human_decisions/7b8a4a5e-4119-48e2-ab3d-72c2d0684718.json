    "vignette": "An 18-month-old girl is seen for a well visit. She has never been immunized and has no known contraindications. Her mother refuses all vaccines today and declines a staged schedule. She requests written documentation of her decision. The child is scheduled to return to a large daycare in a few days because the parent cannot arrange other childcare. The clinic has received a notice that a child in her classroom has been diagnosed with measles, and exposures are still being investigated. You explain that measles can cause severe illness in young children and that being unvaccinated increases risk after exposure. You offer same-day catch-up vaccination, referral to a public-health vaccine clinic, and guidance on temporary exclusion and post-exposure prophylaxis if indicated. The mother refuses all of these and says she will still send the child, so the child will likely return unprotected and without exclusion or prophylaxis. A child protective report would likely trigger an immediate assessment that could enforce temporary exclusion and/or facilitate prophylaxis. State law and clinic policy permit either approach, and neither is mandated. You must decide before completing today’s visit.",
