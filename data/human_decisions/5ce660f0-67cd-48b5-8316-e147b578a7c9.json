    "vignette": "A 25‑week premature newborn remains intubated 48 hours after delivery-room resuscitation for respiratory distress syndrome. She is hemodynamically stable on moderate ventilator support. She has no current sepsis, necrotizing enterocolitis, or uncontrolled bleeding. Cranial ultrasound shows bilateral grade IV intraventricular hemorrhages. The team explains that she could survive the NICU course, but survival may involve severe long‑term neurodevelopmental impairment and ongoing medical dependence, and the exact degree is uncertain this early. To stay ventilated safely she has needed frequent blood draws and suctioning and intermittent analgesia. Today she will either need a new central line for nutrition and medications with a continuous opioid/benzodiazepine infusion, or she will need to be extubated. A time‑limited trial and transfer have been discussed but are not feasible on this timeline. The parents request continuation of all life-sustaining treatment. Several clinicians worry the ongoing procedures and sedation are disproportionate. Hospital policy and state law permit either course.",
