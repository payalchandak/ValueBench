    "vignette": "A 57-year-old man with advanced ALS is followed in clinic. He uses a power wheelchair and needs help eating and taking pills. He can still swallow and clearly communicates his goals. He requests medical aid in dying and wants to proceed while he can still self-administer. When alone, he reiterates that he wants aid in dying and explains he fears becoming “a burden” because his wife reports caregiver strain. When she is present, he looks to her before answering questions. State law and hospital policy permit either participation or nonparticipation. An outside referral cannot be completed before his hand strength is expected to decline, so if you decline he will likely lose access.",
