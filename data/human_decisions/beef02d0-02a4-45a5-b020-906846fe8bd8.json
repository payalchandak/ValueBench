    "vignette": "An 18-month-old girl receives routine intramuscular immunizations per schedule after you confirm no contraindications. Later the same day, you notice a charting discrepancy suggesting she may have received the same set of vaccines at a visit the prior week. If a duplicate dose occurred, most children do well, but fever or marked local swelling can develop overnight. Earlier parental monitoring, antipyretics, or urgent evaluation could reduce complications and could affect how future vaccines are timed. The mother has a documented history of severe health anxiety that has led to repeated unplanned ED visits and stopping vaccines after alarming news. Immediate disclosure could trigger another ED visit or stopping all future vaccines. She has also asked that medical issues not be left on voicemail, and she is not answering calls today; the only way to reach her before close is a brief portal message that may be read without support. If you wait, you can confirm the immunization registry and lot numbers and arrange a nurse call tomorrow morning with clear triage guidance, but delaying disclosure could delay evaluation if the child develops fever or swelling overnight. The clinic has limited nurse triage capacity, and avoidable after-hours ED use strains shared resources. Risk management advises that either immediate portal disclosure or a documented, time-limited delay for verification and planned disclosure is legally permissible. You must decide before end of day.",
