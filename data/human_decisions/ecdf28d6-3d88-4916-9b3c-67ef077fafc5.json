    "vignette": "A 19-year-old man traveled from abroad to serve as a non-directed living kidney donor through your hospital’s established transplant program. He is healthy and compatible within the program’s matching pathway. He has completed the standard medical workup, psychosocial evaluation, and independent donor advocate interviews. In several private interviews he consistently states he has wanted to donate since adolescence and denies being offered money. His mother and stepfather are concerned and warn that his religious community expects members to donate and that refusal can bring serious social consequences. When asked directly about pressure, he avoids discussing his community. He says he can refuse if he wants and still wants to proceed. Hospital counsel confirms that either proceeding or declining is legally permissible.  The nephrectomy is scheduled in four days, and his visa and return flight make rescheduling impractical. You must decide today.",
