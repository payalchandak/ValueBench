You are the on-call surgeon at the local hospital, and imaging confirms acute appendicitis requiring prompt surgical intervention to prevent serious complications including perforation and sepsis. The camp director has been unable to reach the girl's parents by phone or emergency contact numbers. The child is frightened and tearful, repeatedly asking to wait for her mother before any procedure. She states she does not want surgery right now and wants to go home. Delaying surgery increases the risk of rupture and more extensive illness, but the child is clinically stable at this moment. You must decide whether to proceed with appendectomy now or continue attempts to reach the parents while managing her conservatively with intravenous antibiotics and close observation.",
