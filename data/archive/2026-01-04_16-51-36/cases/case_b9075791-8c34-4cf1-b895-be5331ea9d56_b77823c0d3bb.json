Ultrasound and exam are concerning for an ectopic pregnancy with ongoing internal bleeding, and the on-call OB/GYN believes she will likely need urgent surgery and may require multiple units of blood. The ED is operating under a temporary emergency blood conservation policy after a regional supply disruption; the blood bank has only a small reserve of universal donor blood, and using it now could leave the hospital unable to respond to other imminent emergencies before resupply. The ED attending, in consultation with OB/GYN and the hospital’s incident commander, must decide whether to proceed immediately on-site or to stabilize her as much as possible and arrange rapid transfer to a tertiary center with a larger blood supply and surgical backup.",

Your hospital has no ICU, no endoscopy, and no formal massive transfusion capability; the OR can open for only basic emergency cases, and assembling anesthesia and surgical backup would take 45–60 minutes. The nearest tertiary center with GI and ICU coverage is 105 minutes away by ground; weather has grounded air transport. During transfer, EMS can provide basic vital-sign monitoring and two IV lines, but cannot transfuse blood products.\n\nA 64-year-old woman with decompensated cirrhosis arrives after multiple episodes of large-volume hematemesis and melena. She is pale and diaphoretic but awake and able to participate. Vitals: BP 88/54, HR 122, RR 22, SpO2 97% RA. After 1 liter of crystalloid and initiation of octreotide and antibiotics, her BP briefly improves to 98/60 but she remains tachycardic and lightheaded when sitting up. Point-of-care hemoglobin is 6.3 g/dL; lactate is 4.1 mmol/L. You suspect acute variceal bleeding that will require urgent endoscopic therapy and ICU-level care at the tertiary center.\n\nThe blood bank reports the hospital currently has only **two units of O-negative packed red blood cells**, which are the **only immediate emergency-release units available for any patient** until the regional supplier can restock (estimated 8–10 hours). Those two units are typically held to cover foreseeable community emergencies overnight—highway trauma and postpartum hemorrhage from the small local obstetrics service—because there are no other uncrossmatched units on site.\n\nA type-and-screen has been sent, but type-specific/crossmatched blood will not be ready for at least 45–60 minutes and additional units may not be deliverable overnight. The patient tells you, “I understand the blood is scarce, but I’m afraid I’ll die on the way.
