      "source_text": "Case 2-2\nTreating Breast Cancer: Finding the Value Judgments\nIt seemed to May Bachman that she had never been confronted with so\nmany important decisions in such a short time frame in her life. Just two\nshort weeks ago, when she went in for annual mammography, she learned\nthat the microcalcifications in her right breast (the radiologist had been\nmonitoring) had changed in their appearance from the last year’s film.\nMs. Bachman had dense breast tissue with numerous microcalcifications,\nso she knew that annual mammography was in order. She had been told by\nher radiologist that the calcifications could be a sign of ductal carcinoma\nin situ (DCIS). It was still a shock to hear that the changes in the mammog-\nraphy films required more diagnostic tests; a breast biopsy was needed to\nascertain the actual pathology.\nThe results from the core needle biopsy showed that the lesion was\ninvasive cancer. There was no palpable mass in the breast, but only further\noperation would determine the size of the tumor and whether it had in-\nvaded the lymph nodes. In a whirlwind of appointments, Ms. Bachman met\nwith a surgeon to learn about what options were available. If no lymph\nnodes are involved, breast conservation therapy (BCT), also called lumpec-\ntomy, was one option, as was a simple mastectomy (excision of the breast,\nnipple, areola, and most of the overlying skin). Ms. Bachman also met with\nan oncologist who said that further treatment decisions would be based\non the stage of the disease and her age. For example, if the tumor was\nsmall, from 2 to 5 cm, and had invaded the lymph nodes, then she would be\na candidate for chemotherapy. Moreover, whether the tumor was estrogen-\nreceptor positive or negative played a significant role in how aggressive\ntreatment should be.\nDepending on how many lymph nodes were involved, the oncologist\nmight recommend radiation therapy, noting that some studies suggested\nthat postmastectomy radiation therapy was indicated even for patients\nwith Tl-2 (tumor of 1-2 cm) breast cancer with 0-3 positive nodes. The\nchemotherapy had significant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fa-\ntigue, cognitive changes, alopecia, insomnia, and constipation. Another\nserious side effect was ovarian toxicity. Since Ms. Bachman was 87 years\nold and premenopausal, this was of concern to her. It was likely that chemo-\ntherapy would result in amenorrhea and premature menopause. The sur-\ngeon and oncologist stated that if the cancer was in an early stage, they\nwould recommend BCT and aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for\nthe best survival outcomes. Ms. Bachman knew, from looking at reputable\nsites on the Internet, that there was controversy over what was the best\ncourse of action. She felt pressured by the surgeon to choose BCT even\nthough she thought she would feel safer with a more radical removal of\nbreast tissue, but she was not sure. She had so little time to weigh the bene-\nfits and risks of all the different treatment options that were presented to\nher, she felt overwhelmed.",

In consultations over the last week, she has heard multiple treatment pathways—breast-conserving surgery followed by radiation and systemic therapy versus mastectomy with different downstream options—and she says she feels overwhelmed and pressured to “decide right now.” She tells you she is leaning toward mastectomy because it feels more reassuring to her, but she also worries about the impact of more extensive surgery and potential overtreatment. Your oncology colleagues believe that, based on what is known so far, a breast-conserving approach with timely adjuvant therapy is the best way to maximize her chance of long-term control, and they are ready to schedule treatment immediately. You must decide how to proceed at today’s visit.",
