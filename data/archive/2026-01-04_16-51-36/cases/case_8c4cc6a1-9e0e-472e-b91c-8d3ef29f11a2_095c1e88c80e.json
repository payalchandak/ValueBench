She is awake but fluctuates between answering coherently and becoming drowsy, and her partner says she has long been adamant that she would not accept donor blood products; a signed refusal card is in her wallet, but she cannot consistently participate in a full discussion now. The obstetrics team can attempt medications and uterine procedures, but they believe she may die or suffer permanent injury without transfusion if bleeding continues. As the ED attending coordinating care, you must decide how to proceed while there is still time to act.",

Because of hemorrhagic shock and fluctuating mental status, clinicians cannot reliably assess decision-making capacity or obtain a contemporaneous informed refusal.\n\nIn his wallet is a laminated, dated (6 months ago), signed, and witnessed card stating: “Because of my religious beliefs, I refuse transfusion of whole blood, packed red cells, plasma, and platelets under any circumstances, even if life-threatening. If I am unable to communicate, this card is my advance directive.”\n\nA person identifying himself as the patient’s long-term partner arrives and insists, “We aren’t legally married.
