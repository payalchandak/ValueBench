Her records show a prior “classical” uterine incision from an emergency cesarean years ago. The obstetric team explains that labor after this type of incision carries a real possibility of sudden uterine rupture that could rapidly threaten both her life and the baby’s life, and recommends proceeding with a repeat cesarean now. The patient is calm, demonstrates understanding, and repeatedly states she will not consent to surgery because of a previous traumatic operative experience; she asks to continue labor with monitoring and pain control instead. The attending obstetrician must decide how to respond as labor progresses and the window for a planned operation narrows.",
