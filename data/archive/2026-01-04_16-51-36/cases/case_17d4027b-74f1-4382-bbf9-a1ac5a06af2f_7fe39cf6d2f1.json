        "vignette": "A 32-year-old woman with newly diagnosed HIV presents to the outpatient infectious diseases clinic. Her CD4 count is moderately reduced, and she meets criteria for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. She has a documented history of severe neuropsychiatric reactions to efavirenz during a previous brief trial, including suicidal ideation that resolved after discontinuation. The current recommended first-line regimen for her resistance profile and insurance coverage includes efavirenz, which offers the best chance of durable viral suppression and prevention of AIDS-related complications. Alternative regimens are available but have higher pill burden, require more frequent monitoring for metabolic and renal toxicities, and may have lower barriers to resistance if adherence is imperfect. The patient expresses significant anxiety about the neuropsychiatric effects recurring but also fears disease progression. You are the treating infectious diseases physician and must decide on the initial ART regimen.",
        "choice_1": "Initiate the efavirenz-based regimen with close monitoring for neuropsychiatric effects, given its superior efficacy and durability for this patient's viral suppression.",

Replace with neutral language: 'both regimens are effective for viral suppression' or 'the efavirenz regimen is effective but carries neuropsychiatric risk; the alternative regimen is also effective but has different side effects and monitoring needs.'
