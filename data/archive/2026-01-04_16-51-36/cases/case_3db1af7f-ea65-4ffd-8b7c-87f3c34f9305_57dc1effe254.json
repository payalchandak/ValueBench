Laboratory studies show thrombocytopenia and elevated liver enzymes consistent with HELLP syndrome. The obstetric team recommends immediate delivery to prevent maternal seizures, stroke, and potentially fatal complications. The patient understands the risks but firmly refuses, stating that she believes the baby needs more time to develop and that she wants to wait at least another few weeks. She is alert, oriented, and able to articulate her reasoning clearly. Delaying delivery poses serious risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. You are the emergency physician working with the obstetric consultant to determine the next step in management.",

Expectant management is not clinically defensible when maternal life is at serious risk from HELLP. To make both options defensible, either: (1) reduce the severity to 'mild preeclampsia without severe features' where expectant management is sometimes considered, or (2) reframe to a scenario where both maternal and fetal outcomes have more balanced risks, such as earlier gestational age (e.g., 24 weeks) where delivery also carries substantial neonatal morbidity/mortality risk, creating genuine clinical equipoise."
