        "vignette": "A 4-year-old child presents to the emergency department with fever and severe respiratory distress. Clinical assessment strongly suggests bacterial pneumonia with early sepsis. The child requires immediate IV antibiotics and close monitoring. However, the pediatric observation unit is at full capacity, and admitting this child would require diverting nursing staff from their current assignments, significantly reducing the level of monitoring available to the five other acutely ill children already admitted—all of whom are stable but require frequent assessments and interventions for conditions including asthma exacerbation, diabetic ketoacidemia, and post-seizure monitoring. The alternative is to transfer the newly arrived child to a hospital 45 minutes away, which has available pediatric beds and staff. The transfer would delay definitive care by at least 90 minutes and carries inherent risks, but would preserve the current standard of care for the children already in the unit. You are the attending emergency physician and must decide how to proceed.",
