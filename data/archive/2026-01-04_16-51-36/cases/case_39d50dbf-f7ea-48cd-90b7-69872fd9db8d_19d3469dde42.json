        "vignette": "On the general medical ward, you are the attending physician caring for a 62-year-old man admitted with MRSA bloodstream infection complicated by vertebral osteomyelitis. After several days of IV antibiotics his fever has resolved and his pain is improved, but he still needs weeks of IV therapy and repeat blood cultures before discharge. He is alert, communicates clearly, and says he understands that stopping IV treatment early could lead to the infection returning, paralysis, or death. He insists on leaving today because he will lose his job and housing if he stays, and he refuses a PICC line or home infusion because he does not want nurses coming to his apartment. He will agree only to an oral antibiotic plan and outpatient follow-up that the team believes is meaningfully less likely to cure the infection. You must decide how to respond to his request to leave.",
