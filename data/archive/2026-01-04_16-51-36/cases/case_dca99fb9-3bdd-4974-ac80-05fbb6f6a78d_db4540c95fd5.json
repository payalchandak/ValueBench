        "vignette": "A 32-year-old woman with severe preeclampsia at 28 weeks gestation develops HELLP syndrome and is admitted to the ICU. She undergoes emergency cesarean delivery, but experiences massive postpartum hemorrhage complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation. She remains critically unstable, requiring multiple vasopressors, mechanical ventilation, and ongoing transfusion support. The ICU is operating at full capacity, and maintaining her current level of intensive support requires continuous one-to-one nursing, monopolizes the blood bank's platelet inventory, and has required diversion of two other critically ill patients to facilities over an hour away. Her prognosis remains highly uncertain; she may recover with aggressive continued support, but she may also develop irreversible multi-organ failure. The ICU team must decide whether to continue the current resource-intensive care or transition to a less aggressive approach that would free critical resources for other patients. You are the attending intensivist responsible for her care.",
