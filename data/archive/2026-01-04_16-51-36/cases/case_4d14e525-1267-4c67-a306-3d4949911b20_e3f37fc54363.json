He is awake but exhausted, intermittently confused from sepsis and pain medications, and cannot participate in a reliable goals-of-care discussion; there is no advance directive, and his only relative reachable by phone says, “I don’t know what he would want—please do what you think is right.” The general surgery attending must decide within hours whether to take him for an emergency laparotomy that could remove the source of infection and offer a chance of survival but would likely involve a prolonged ICU course with major postoperative complications and significant suffering, or to forgo surgery and focus on aggressive symptom control and comfort knowing that the infection is expected to progress without operative source control.",

CT scan shows free intraperitoneal air consistent with perforated viscus, and surgery recommends emergent exploratory laparotomy with likely bowel resection.\n\nChart review shows a signed POLST from 6 months ago: DNR/DNI and “Limited interventions” (no ICU, no intubation, no prolonged mechanical ventilation, no dialysis; antibiotics acceptable; comfort-focused treatment).
