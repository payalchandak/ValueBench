No one else wants to see her. Naomi\nis very subdued and has a deep cut along the top of her thigh. Her legs and arms are criss-\ncrossed with scars. She asks you to just hurry up and ‘practise your suturing’ so that she\ncan get home in time for a family roast. You are concerned about her blasé attitude to her\ninjuries. Looking through the notes you discover this is her 18th attendance to A&E in the\npast 6 months for similar treatment. You try to talk to Naomi about why she self-harms.\nNaomi is surprised, as no one has asked her this before.\nQuestions\n• How should patients who self-harm be managed?\n• What can be done to prevent a ‘revolving door’ system of hospital admissions?",

She is calm and insists you “just stitch it quickly” so she can leave for a family meal, and she refuses to discuss why she self-harms or to involve her parent/guardian, saying she does not want “a big fuss.” The wound needs repair and you are worried that treating and discharging her as requested will reinforce a cycle of escalating harm, but holding her longer for a psychosocial assessment may feel coercive, strain trust, and could require breaching confidentiality to ensure follow-up and safety planning. As the treating clinician, you must decide what to recommend now.",
