        "vignette": "A 68-year-old woman with metastatic pancreatic cancer presents to the emergency department with severe abdominal pain and vomiting. She has been receiving palliative chemotherapy with modest disease stabilization. CT imaging reveals a complete small bowel obstruction. The surgical team assesses that she is a candidate for palliative surgical bypass, which could relieve her symptoms and potentially allow her to resume eating and return home for several weeks to months. However, the procedure would require at least six hours of operating room time and several days in the ICU for postoperative monitoring. The hospital is currently experiencing critical capacity constraints: the emergency department is on diversion, elective surgeries have been postponed, and multiple patients are waiting for ICU beds. Using these resources for this patient would mean further delays for other patients awaiting cancer resections, urgent cardiac procedures, and ICU-level care. The patient is cognitively intact and requests the surgery, understanding both her prognosis and the operation's palliative nature. You are the attending oncologist consulted to help guide the decision about whether to proceed with surgery.",
