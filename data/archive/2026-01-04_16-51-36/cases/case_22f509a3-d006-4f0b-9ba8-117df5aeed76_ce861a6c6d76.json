        "vignette": "A 72-year-old man with moderate dementia and type 2 diabetes presents to your family medicine clinic with his daughter. His hemoglobin A1c is elevated, and his current regimen is not achieving glycemic targets. The daughter reports he has been increasingly confused and has had several falls at home in the past months. You are considering whether to intensify his diabetes management with additional medications that could better prevent long-term microvascular complications, including vision loss and kidney disease. However, more aggressive glucose control would increase his risk of hypoglycemic episodes, which in his case could lead to further confusion, additional falls, and potential serious injury. His daughter is concerned about both his long-term health and his immediate safety. As his family physician, you must decide on the treatment approach.",
