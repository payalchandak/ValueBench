      "source_text": "CASE 23:\nNON-ENGAGEMENT WITH THERAPEUTIC MEDICATION\nDuring your final year at medical school you decide to attend the hospital’s clinical ethics\ncommittee meeting as you have an interest in medical ethics and would like to see what type\nof cases are brought for discussion. Tonight a diabetes specialist nurse has presented a case of\na 16-year-old girl, Stephanie, who has suffered from diabetes since a young age. Stephanie has\npreviously had well-controlled blood sugar levels with a four times daily insulin regime and\ncarbohydrate counting. Over the last year, however, the nurse has become very concerned\nabout a decline in her physical health. She does not think that Stephanie is taking her i nsulin\nregularly as she is losing weight, has had recurrent infections and her blood sugars have\nrisen. She has also missed several important appointments including one with the paediatric\nconsultant. Whenever the nurse tries to discuss her diabetic control, Stephanie closes up and\ninsists her medication control is fine. The nurse is at a loss as to how to help Stephanie further.\nQuestions\n• How can Stephanie’s non-engagement with treatment be managed?\n• How can the medical profession encourage teenagers to engage with healthcare?",

        "vignette": "You are the diabetes specialist nurse for Stephanie, a 16-year-old with type 1 diabetes since childhood. For years, her control was excellent with a four-times-daily insulin regimen. Over the past year, she has lost weight, developed recurrent infections, and her blood glucose levels have worsened—signs strongly suggesting she is not taking her insulin as prescribed. She has missed several clinic appointments, including one with the endocrinologist. When you try to discuss her diabetes management, she becomes withdrawn and insists everything is fine. You believe her non-adherence poses serious risk of diabetic ketoacidosis and long-term complications. One option is to escalate the case—informing her parents, involving child protection services, or arranging a psychiatric assessment—to ensure she receives treatment. The other option is to continue working with Stephanie on her own terms, building trust gradually without overriding her resistance, even if it means accepting ongoing poor control in the short term. As her primary diabetes clinician, you must decide how to proceed.",
