        "vignette": "An 88-year-old woman with advanced dementia arrives at the emergency department with fever, hypotension, and altered mental status consistent with severe sepsis. She lives in a nursing home, is nonverbal, and has recurrent aspiration pneumonias. Her healthcare proxy, her daughter, is unavailable and cannot be reached. The ED is severely overcrowded with a 12-hour wait time; multiple critically ill patients are boarding in hallways, and the hospital has activated crisis capacity protocols. Aggressive sepsis management for this patient would require immediate intensive monitoring, multiple IV access attempts, fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and likely ICU-level care for at least several days, consuming significant nursing time and a monitored bed. The intensive approach carries meaningful risks of iatrogenic harm including difficult IV placement causing distress, fluid overload, delirium from the ICU environment, and potential complications from invasive interventions, with uncertain likelihood of survival or return to baseline. Alternatively, the team could provide comfort-focused care with oxygen, antipyretics, and symptom management, accepting that this approach forgoes potentially life-extending treatment but avoids burdensome interventions and frees critical resources for other patients in the crowded ED. You are the attending emergency physician and must decide on the initial care approach before the proxy can be reached.",
