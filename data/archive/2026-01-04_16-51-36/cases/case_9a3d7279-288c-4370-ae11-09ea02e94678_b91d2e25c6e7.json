        "vignette": "A 68-year-old man with severe COPD presents to the emergency department with acute respiratory distress. He requires high-flow oxygen and is borderline for intubation. The patient has experienced multiple prior exacerbations requiring ICU admission, and his baseline functional status has progressively declined. He lives alone and struggles with medication adherence. The ED is experiencing a surge, with a multi-casualty motor vehicle collision overwhelming capacity. The ICU has one remaining bed. The attending physician knows that this patient, if admitted, will likely require prolonged ICU support with uncertain benefit given his declining trajectory, and that admitting him now will mean the next critically ill patient—potentially a trauma victim with better recovery prospects—will need to be diverted to a hospital 45 minutes away, delaying definitive care. The attending must decide whether to admit this patient to the remaining ICU bed or to arrange transfer to another facility to preserve local ICU capacity for incoming critical patients.",
