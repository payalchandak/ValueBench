        "vignette": "A healthcare assistant working on a medical ward has consistently declined the annual influenza vaccination for the past three years, citing personal concerns about side effects and a belief that she has a strong immune system. This year, the hospital is experiencing staffing shortages during flu season, and several vulnerable patients on her ward have chronic cardiac and respiratory conditions that place them at high risk for severe complications from influenza. The infection control team has approached her supervisor to discuss whether unvaccinated staff should be reassigned away from high-risk patient areas during peak flu season. Her supervisor must now decide whether to require her vaccination as a condition of continuing to work directly with these patients or to respect her refusal and allow her to continue in her current role with standard precautions. Reassignment would create significant operational challenges for the ward and might affect her career development, while allowing her to continue unvaccinated could pose infection risk to vulnerable patients despite other protective measures being in place. As her supervisor, what should you recommend?",
