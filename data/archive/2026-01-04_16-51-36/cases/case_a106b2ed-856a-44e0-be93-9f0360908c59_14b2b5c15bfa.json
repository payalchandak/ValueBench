Lauren says she is proud of her identity but does not want her child to face the barriers she has faced, and she is clear that she would not proceed with IVF at this clinic unless embryo selection is part of the plan. The clinician believes deafness can be compatible with a good life and worries that offering selection for this condition turns a valued identity into something to be prevented, potentially harming Lauren’s well-being and the clinician’s therapeutic relationship either way. The clinic has no clear policy for or against testing for this indication, and the decision is left to the treating physician.",

        "vignette": "A 38-year-old woman with primary infertility and markedly diminished ovarian reserve (AMH 0.3 ng/mL; an IVF cycle 6 months ago produced 3 oocytes and no transferable embryos) presents to begin ovarian stimulation for a new cycle. She and her partner are both carriers of a GJB2 mutation associated with congenital, non–life-threatening sensorineural deafness. She reports multiple Deaf relatives and says that, while she respects Deaf culture, she does not feel equipped emotionally or financially to parent a child with congenital deafness. She requests preimplantation genetic testing for monogenic disease (PGT‑M) specifically to select against embryos predicted to have congenital deafness.\n\nDuring intake she signed acknowledgment of the clinic’s written policy: the program will not offer PGT to select against non–life-threatening traits/disabilities. The policy cites justice-based concerns about reinforcing disability stigma and maintaining trust with the local disability community (including current patients who are Deaf or have disabled family members). The physician shares concern that offering PGT‑M in this circumstance could be perceived as discriminatory or eugenic and could harm community relationships.\n\nThe patient frames the request as a deeply personal, values-based reproductive decision and asks the physician to honor her autonomous choice. She adds that she is willing to accept the risk of having no embryos to transfer if testing leaves none suitable.\n\nBecause PGT‑M requires probe development, embryology coordination, and specialized consent language, a decision must be made before stimulation and medication purchase. If the clinic refuses, the nearest center willing to do PGT‑M for this indication is several hours away; transfer of care would add substantial out-of-pocket cost and likely delay treatment by 2–3 months—time she fears she may not have given her low reserve—reducing her chance of pregnancy. If the clinic proceeds without PGT‑M (or with IVF only), she says she would likely cancel transfer if the only embryo(s) available carried the mutation, which could mean going through stimulation and retrieval without achieving a pregnancy attempt.",
