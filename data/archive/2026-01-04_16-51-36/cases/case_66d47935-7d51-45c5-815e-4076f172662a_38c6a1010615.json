        "vignette": "An 89-year-old woman with advanced dementia, recurrent aspiration pneumonia, and severe dysphagia is admitted to the general ward with her fourth pneumonia in six months. She requires constant one-to-one supervision to prevent her from pulling out her nasogastric tube and attempting to eat regular food, which she persistently requests despite being unable to swallow safely. The ward is chronically short-staffed, and assigning a dedicated staff member to her care means that other patients on the unit receive delayed assistance with mobility, toileting, and medication administration. Some patients have experienced falls and pressure injuries in recent months due to insufficient staffing. The team could continue the current intensive one-to-one supervision to maximize her nutrition and prevent aspiration, or redistribute staff more evenly across all patients. You are the attending physician responsible for decisions about resource allocation on the ward.",
