        "vignette": "A 78-year-old man with end-stage COPD and heart failure is on home hospice with a clear comfort-focused plan. Over the last day he has developed severe air hunger and panic despite oxygen, a fan, and low-dose oral morphine; he is now too breathless to speak in full sentences and is intermittently drowsy. The hospice physician believes escalating to a continuous opioid infusion and adding a sedating medication could reliably relieve his distress, but it would likely deepen sedation and may worsen carbon dioxide retention, raising concern about potentially shortening life. The bedside nurse reports the family is frightened that “stronger meds will stop his breathing,” yet they also cannot bear watching him struggle. The physician must decide how aggressively to treat his refractory symptoms tonight.",
