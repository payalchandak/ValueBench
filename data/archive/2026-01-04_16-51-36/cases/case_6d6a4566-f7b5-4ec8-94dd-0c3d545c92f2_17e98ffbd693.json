        "vignette": "In the Emergency Department, you are the attending physician caring for a 62-year-old with severe COPD who arrives in acute respiratory distress and rising carbon dioxide levels. They are awake, oriented, and can clearly explain their wishes. After a brief trial of noninvasive ventilation, they say the mask feels unbearable and repeatedly refuse any further ventilatory support, including intubation, stating they would rather “take my chances” and not be restrained. Their adult child arrives and pleads for you to “do everything,” arguing the patient always bounces back after flares and may regret refusing once they are more short of breath. The team believes ventilatory support could stabilize the patient and likely allow discharge back to baseline, but proceeding against the patient’s stated refusal would require sedation and physical restraint in the ED.\n\nAs the treating physician, you must decide whether to honor the patient’s refusal now or to proceed with escalating ventilatory support despite the refusal to try to prevent a potentially reversible death.",
