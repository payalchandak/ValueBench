A 14-year-old asks for contraception because she expects to become sexually active with her slightly older boyfriend soon; she says she has not had intercourse yet and wants to avoid pregnancy. She appears thoughtful and can explain how different methods work, the importance of condoms for infections, and what she would do if a method failed. She is adamant that her parents must not be told, saying they are strict and that disclosure would lead to serious conflict at home; she also asks that nothing be sent to her home address. She denies being pressured, intoxicated, or fearful of her boyfriend, but she also shares that he sometimes gets angry when she changes her mind. You are concerned about potential coercion and the medical and emotional consequences if she has unprotected sex, but you also worry that providing contraception in secrecy could keep adults unaware of a situation that might be unsafe for her.",

She says he has made this threat twice in the past month and recently demanded she send additional explicit photos. She feels “trapped,” denies physical assault, and is unsure whether he will follow through, but reports he knows where she waits for the bus and has shown up unexpectedly after arguments.\n\nShe explicitly refuses parent notification and refuses any report to child protective services (CPS) or police, stating she fears retaliation, humiliation at school if images spread, and being blamed or punished at home. She asks the clinician to “just give me birth control and keep it private.”\n\nThe clinician plans to provide clinically appropriate contraceptive care regardless of the reporting decision. The clinician is uncertain whether the disclosures meet the mandated-reporting threshold in this jurisdiction (i.e., whether the boyfriend’s threats and coercive control constitute “reasonable suspicion” of exploitation), but is concerned the situation could escalate and that other minors could also be at risk if the boyfriend’s behavior continues unchecked.",
