Despite maximal medications and an intra-aortic balloon pump, he remains dependent on high-dose support and is intermittently awake but too confused and short of breath to participate reliably in complex decisions; no advance directive is available. The ICU and cardiology teams agree that placing veno-arterial ECMO could keep him alive long enough to potentially recover heart function or be evaluated for longer-term support, but it would require large cannulas, deep sedation, and carries a substantial chance of serious complications such as major bleeding, stroke, limb ischemia, and a prolonged ICU course with significant suffering if recovery does not occur. His spouse asks the team to “do everything,” while some clinicians worry the intervention may simply extend a difficult dying process. The attending intensivist must decide whether to escalate to ECMO now or to forgo ECMO and focus on comfort-focused care if shock progresses.",

He had ~25 minutes of CPR before return of spontaneous circulation. He is intubated, on high-dose vasopressors, and has refractory hypoxemia and cardiogenic shock. The working diagnosis is a massive pulmonary embolism versus an acute myocardial infarction—both potentially reversible—but his neurologic outcome is uncertain. He is not following commands and is currently sedated for ventilator synchrony.\n\nThere is no written advance directive or POLST. His spouse is the legally authorized surrogate decision-maker under state law and requests that the team “do everything.” His adult daughter arrives and reports that within the past month—after a close friend spent weeks on life support with severe brain injury—her father repeatedly and specifically said he would not want to be kept alive on machines for a prolonged period if he could not regain meaningful neurologic function. The spouse acknowledges hearing “comments like that” but believes he would accept aggressive care if there were any chance of recovery.\n\nThe ICU team explains that veno-arterial ECMO would require cannulation within the next 30–60 minutes to have any chance of benefit. ECMO could be framed as a time-limited trial to bridge treatment of a reversible cause, but it can also lead to days to weeks of invasive support and carries substantial risks (intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, limb ischemia, infection). The hospital has one ECMO circuit available tonight; another patient in the region is being evaluated for transfer, but they have not yet been accepted as an ECMO candidate.
