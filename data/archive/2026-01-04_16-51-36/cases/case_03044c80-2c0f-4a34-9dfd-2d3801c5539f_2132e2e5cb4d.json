      "source_text": "=». Case 3-5\nAbortion in a Catholic Hospital\nNatasha Jones was a 34-year-old, single, African American woman preg-\nnant for the fourth time. She was being seen in the prenatal clinic at the\ncommunity's only tertiary care Catholic hospital because she had a history\nof three previous episodes of ruptured uterus that had resulted in the\ndeaths of her previous fetuses. She was currently in her twentieth week of\npregnancy. She was a member of a local Baptist church.\nDr. Lakisha Nevitt, her attending physician, was very concerned be-\ncause ultrasound revealed that a portion of Ms. Jones's uterine wall was no\nmore than a millimeter in thickness. She was convinced it would soon rup-\nture, ending the life of the fetus and posing a serious risk to Ms. Jones's life.\nIt was her opinion that, with virtual certainty, the uterus would rupture\nbefore the fetus could reach full term.\nDr. Nevitt knew that, since the hospital had a Roman Catholic affilia-\ntion, abortion could not be performed there. Even though Dr. Nevitt was\nherself not Catholic, she accepted this stance when she went to work at this\nhospital. Even if an exception could be made in this case to preserve the\nlife of the mother, no one in the hospital's obstetrics department had enough\nexperience with abortion to perform one safely. The real issue was whether\nthey should advise Ms. Jones of the seriousness of her situation and recom-\nmend that she be transferred to City Hospital, which was only a mile away\nand had a staff with considerable experience with abortion.\nDr. Nevitt asked for a hospital ethics committee meeting to try to sort\nout the options. There was a quick consensus among the medical people on\nthe committee that this was a life-threatening situation and that Ms. Jones's\nuterus would almost certainly rupture well before a full-term birth. The\nethics committee included two Catholic chaplains, both of whom empha-\nsized that since they were in a Catholic institution, they must begin with\nthe presumption that all life, including fetal life, is sacred and cannot be\nintentionally terminated. The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic\nHealth Care Services was cited, which states categorically, “Abortion (that\nis, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the\ndirectly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted.”\nOne of the committee members raised the question of whether an ex-\nception can be made for preserving the life of the mother. He pointed out\nthat it seems tragic to condone the death of both mother and fetus when at\nleast the mother could be saved. Since this was an extremely rare case\nwhere there was virtual certainty that the mother could not survive the rup-\nture and that, if this occurred, the fetus would die as well, he urged making\nan exception by informing the woman that their committee recommend\nthat she be transferred to a secular hospital such as City Hospital.\nOne of the chaplains responded, pointing out that the prohibition was\nexceptionless. The only possibility would be to interpret the intervention as\nan “indirect” killing of the fetus, which would be acceptable for proportion-\nally good reasons. This, he indicated, was the reasoning used in cases in\nwhich a pregnant woman has cancer of the uterus. In such cases a hyster-\nectomy is permitted to remove the cancer even though the fetus would die\nin the process. He suggested that perhaps a hysterectomy could be accept-\nable in this case as well since the weakness in the uterine wall would pose\na threat to the woman not only in this pregnancy but in any future pregnan-\ncies as well. He acknowledged that this reasoning was controversial but\nthought it would justify a recommendation from the committee that the pa-\ntient be directed to the City Hospital. He noted that legally the hospital was\nnot required to have staff to perform abortions, but that they were required\nto inform the patient of treatment options—including transferring to an-\nother hospital that would offer abortion services.\nThe committee members recognized that, if this case had arisen in any\nother hospital without an institutional commitment opposing all direct\nabortions, a recommendation for terminating this pregnancy would be\nreached by easy consensus.\nThe dilemma here is how the moral stance of the sponsors of the hospi-\ntal should shape the way medicine is practiced in this institution.",

She is hemodynamically stable and not bleeding now but has had two episodes of painless vaginal bleeding in the past week. Her hemoglobin is 10.1 g/dL (11.8 g/dL two weeks ago). \n\nThe team explains that at 20 weeks the fetus cannot survive outside the womb. Based on local data and published series, they estimate a 25–35% risk of sudden massive hemorrhage or uterine rupture before viability. If a hemorrhage occurs, there is a high likelihood (>60%) she would need an emergent hysterectomy with large-volume transfusion and increased risk of bladder/ureteral injury compared with a planned procedure. If she continues the pregnancy and reaches viability, neonatal survival becomes possible, but maternal risk at delivery remains very high (often 80–90% chance of hysterectomy with significant hemorrhage), with possible ICU admission.\n\nShe is alert, can clearly restate the diagnosis and alternatives, appreciates probabilities and consequences, and demonstrates decision-making capacity. She states her priority is to try to continue the pregnancy to give the fetus a chance, but she is also frightened of dying and leaving her two children without a mother. She lives 2 hours away, is the primary caregiver, and has limited ability to relocate. The team notes that expectant management typically requires prolonged inpatient monitoring at a tertiary center because rapid hemorrhage can be fatal and transport delays are dangerous; this would mean weeks of hospitalization, high cost, major childcare disruption, and use of a limited high-acuity antepartum bed.
