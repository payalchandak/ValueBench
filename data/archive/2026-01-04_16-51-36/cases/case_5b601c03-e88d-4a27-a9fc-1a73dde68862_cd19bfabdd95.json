        "vignette": "A 28-year-old man is admitted to the ICU following a high-speed motor vehicle crash. Despite comprehensive medical efforts, he meets neurologic criteria for death after two independent evaluations, confirming his passing. The electronic health record includes a scanned authorization form documenting his enrollment in the state donor registry with consent for the donation of all eligible organs and tissues. The organ procurement organization (OPO) verifies that his donor status is still active and has not been revoked. They inform the medical team that if recovery planning does not begin within the next 2-4 hours, ongoing vasopressor requirements and expected hemodynamic decline will likely render him ineligible for multi-organ donation, which could potentially save many patients on the transplant waiting list. The patient’s spouse arrives and vehemently objects to the donation, citing that he had expressed distress about organ donation two weeks prior and had sent a text message 12 days ago stating, \"I'm taking myself off the donor list—I don't want them cutting me up.\" However, this text message cannot be legally authenticated as a formal revocation of his consent. Notably, there’s no signed documentation of his removal from the registry in the chart. The spouse insists that the medical team halt the OPO procedures and threatens to contact the media and legal counsel if the donation continues, stating it would cause her immense psychological distress. Hospital policy on unreversed authorizations in the face of reported changed wishes presents conflicting guidance, but both pathways remain legally permissible under current regulations. The team must now choose whether to abide by the documented authorization or the spouse's claims of his changed wishes.",
