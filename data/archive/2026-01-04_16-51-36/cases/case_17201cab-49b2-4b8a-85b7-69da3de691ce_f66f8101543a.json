      "source_text": "Case 7-3\nConfessing an Error in Judgment: Is It Necessary?\nEmilia Hedges is a 68-year-old woman who saw her primary care physician,\nLawrence Aleman, soon after experiencing sudden slurring of speech and\nbrief weakness in the right upper arm. She reported that the episode lasted\nabout thirty minutes, with clearing of all symptoms. Dr. Aleman prescribed\naspirin and asked her to report back if any similar symptoms returned.\nThree days later she was hospitalized with a major left-sided cerebral\nvascular accident (CVA), or stroke. An ultrasound examination of the left\ncarotid artery revealed a 98 percent narrowing (called a “pinpointO”n) t.h e\nneurology service, Ms. Hedges was treated with anticoagulants (blood\nthinners). A month later, an operation was performed to remove the clot\n(a procedure called an endarterectomy). She subsequently was left with\nmarked weakness of the right upper arm and some impairment o¢ fh er\nspeech.\nDr. Aleman was terribly distressed by this outcome. He felt guilta bou!\nmissing the signs of a transient ischemic attack that indicated a ‘severe\nobstruction of blood flow to the left side of the brain, affecting the rightarm\nand the speech center. He realized there were more things he could have\ndone during Ms. Hedges'’s initial visit, such as listening to the carotid arter-\nies with a stethoscope. Hearing a murmur suggesting blockage is clinically\nhelpful, even if it is not definitive. Also, he could have ordered sso me nonin-\nvasive diagnostic tests to narrow the possibilities.\nNow he faces the dilemma of whether he should say something to\nMs. Hedges about the fact that he realizes he could have, probably should\nhave, done more for her. Primary care physicians are frequently placed in\na position in which they are not sure whether they ought to refer a patient\nto a specialist. That comes with the territory of being a general internist or\nprimary care doctor. Dr. Aleman’s question is whether, when he realizes he\nmade the wrong judgment, he should say something to his patient about it\nAt this point there is really nothing that can be done to reverse his error\nin judgment. Telling Ms. Hedges could seriously damage the trust and con-\nfidence that she has in him. It will be an embarrassing and unpleasant\nexperience for him and arguably will not do anything to help Ms. Hedges\ncorrect the effects of Dr. Aleman’s error.",

The physician prescribed aspirin and advised her to return if symptoms recurred. Three days later, the patient suffered a major stroke with permanent right arm weakness and speech impairment. Imaging revealed severe carotid artery narrowing. In retrospect, the physician recognizes that the initial presentation was a transient ischemic attack and that additional evaluation—such as carotid auscultation or noninvasive vascular studies—could have identified the critical stenosis and potentially prevented the stroke through earlier intervention. The patient has recovered to her current baseline and continues to see the physician for ongoing care. She has not questioned the initial management and appears to trust her physician. No legal claim has been filed. The physician must now decide whether to disclose the missed diagnostic opportunity. Telling the patient may damage the therapeutic relationship, cause emotional distress, and serve no medical purpose, as the harm cannot be reversed. Not disclosing avoids these harms but withholds information the patient may have a right to know. You are the treating physician.",
