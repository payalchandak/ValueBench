        "vignette": "A 42-year-old uninsured patient presents to the emergency department with fever, productive cough, and hypoxemia. Imaging reveals severe bilateral pneumonia with early sepsis. The patient meets criteria for a newer monoclonal antibody therapy that significantly improves outcomes in severe community-acquired pneumonia, reducing mortality and ICU length of stay. However, the medication costs approximately $8,000 per dose and is not covered by the hospital's charity care fund. The ED has a limited discretionary budget for uncompensated expensive therapeutics; using it for this patient would exhaust funds that typically support treatments for multiple uninsured patients over several months. Standard antibiotic therapy remains available and is often effective, though this patient's severity of illness suggests substantial risk of clinical deterioration. The attending physician must decide whether to authorize the expensive therapy for this patient.",
