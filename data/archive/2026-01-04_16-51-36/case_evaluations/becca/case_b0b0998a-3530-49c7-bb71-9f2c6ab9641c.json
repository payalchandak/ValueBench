  "comments": "this case should be a no-brainer, though in changing political environment it may be put to the test. Interestingly, in George W Bush presidency, the Patriot Act placed some requirements on limits of confidentiality re terrorism after 9/11. there was a lot of concern re erosion of confidentiality. in practice it largely didn't materialize but that may also have something to do with HIPAA that went into effect two years later and lessened confidentiality across the board.",
