  "comments": "I am concerned about the cases aligning autonomy with just what the patient's stated wish is. Autonomy in Beauchamp and childress parlance is repsect for autonomous ddecision-making; incapacitated decision-making is not, by definition, autonomous.  so the options really revolve here as in some of the other cases around the standard for capacity. does the physician believe the patient is competent in legal terms/ has capacity in clinical terms.  choice 1 indeed promotes the patients stated wish but does not promote autonomy if the wish is not capacitated.",
