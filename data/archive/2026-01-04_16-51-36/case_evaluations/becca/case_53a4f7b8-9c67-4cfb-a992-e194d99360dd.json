  "comments": "as in other mature minor case, clinically bringing an adult into the loop is critical. in this case, there also may be criminal activity with ongoing risk of harm implicated because the BF is over 18 to justify the mandated report. protecting minors is a legal, clinical and ethical obligation. it is not autonomy promoting to continue to have a minor subject to exploitation or coersion just because it is a stated wish. The cases need to go beyond stated wish re autonomy.",
