  "comments": "this case would benefit from a little more information because it is so specialized.  what is the general clinical recommendation? what are the reasons given for the policy? is the policy an outlier? again, this doesn't necessarily promote autonomy if the decision-maker isn't capacitated or doesn't have the maturity to make a decision. Not saying that's the case here -- only that the vignette maybe could benefit from a bit more nuance.",
