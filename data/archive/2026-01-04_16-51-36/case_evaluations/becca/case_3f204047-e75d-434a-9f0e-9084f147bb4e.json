  "comments": "the issue here is which decision is on balance better for the patient in the setting of capacitated decision-makers who are temporarily unavailable.  the modecode as increasingly adopted in US jurisdictions, however, does not allow guardians to admit or commit to a mental hospital and requires court oversight.  so having more legal clarity about what's permissible and required would be important.  Relevant caselaw at the federal level includes Zinermon v Burch (1990). For a version of the uniform probate code codified in MA law, see MGH Ch. 190B Article V. there is significant variability in other jurisdictions. The Convention on the Rights of persons with disability (UN CRPD) to which the US is not a signatory prioritizes individual decision over involuntary care.",
