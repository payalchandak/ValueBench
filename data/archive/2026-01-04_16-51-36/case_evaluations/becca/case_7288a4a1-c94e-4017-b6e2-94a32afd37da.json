  "comments": "would be helpful to understand the legal requirements more clearly -- it's not clear that writing a note in the chart is illegal or actionable. on the other hand, would you be practicing in another state where you are not licensed? what is the nature of the licensing board's jurisdiction over this? this seems to be a case of where doing the right thing for the patient might risk the physicians' wellbeing or licensure.  This is a complex issue of conscience. not sure it really aligns with just the four principles as stated. it could be bifurcated -- what is the right thing to do for the patient vs what do you do?",
