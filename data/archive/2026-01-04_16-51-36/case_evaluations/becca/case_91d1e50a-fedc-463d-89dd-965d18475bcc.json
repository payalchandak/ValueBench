  "comments": "honoring the stated wishes of an individual following self-harm crisis is NOT autonomy promoting. autonomy involves at a minimum respect for autonomous decision making/ rationality. it is not respecting or promoting autonomy to follow what a patient says when their thoughts are being influenced by a psychiatric process such as depression. in addition, there are laws that obligate physicians to act when a person has self-harmed due to mental illness and it is both clinically and ethically wrong to collude with an otherwise healthy patient in completing suicide.",
