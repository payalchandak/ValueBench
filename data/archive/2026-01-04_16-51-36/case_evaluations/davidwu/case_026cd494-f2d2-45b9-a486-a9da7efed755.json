  "comments": "I'm not sure the scenario makes sense. In the event of an acute situation, the attending physician is responsible for doing the right thing for the patient in front of them. The attending is not going around checking the bed situation in the ICU; that's not their role. It's the job of the ICU physician toch beds are available. Additionally, the ER is typically able to intubate and initiate pressors for patients awaiting ICU transfer.",
