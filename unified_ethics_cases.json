        "case": "Giving an example of my own might make things clearer. As a general practitioner I looked after a proud and private man who in his late sixties became seriously ill with lung cancer. (Rumour had it that he was one of the best diamond ‘fences’ in Europe, but that was not in the notes!). His wife called me after evening surgery to visit him at home. I found he had become suddenly jaundiced and very weak. A group of us had just opened a community hospital that was designed to provide good terminal care. As it was late at night and not much could be done then, I suggested I admit him to the new hospital. His wife was exhausted and keen on this plan. His pain and other symptoms were well controlled with medication. I came to say goodnight to him in the hospital and told him I was in a bit of a hurry but would see him in the morning. He gave me a look that I did not understand. In the morning I found that he had died quietly in the night.\n\nThe relatives, in spite of their grief, were pleased with his care and his peaceful end: but for me that look of his would not leave me, in some way I had let him down. I won’t ever know what the look was about, of course, or whether I had interpreted his glance correctly, but when I put myself in his situation, I began to see what might have been happening. I am sure he knew he was in his last hours, was surprised I did not know that (or did not tell him), and he wanted to talk about something important. He was alone, away from his family and the circumstances that he knew. There were no mobiles: perhaps he had no chance to deliver important final messages.\n\nI was left with disquiet. Nobody could fault my clinical care. I had acted entirely within the law. No one was making a complaint. I had used the hospital exactly as it was intended. And yet some part of my care had not been right. Discounting my own sadness – I liked him and we had worked hard together in his last illness – on a human level my care was deficient, because it had not crossed my mind that this might be his last night. Even a company telephonist is trained to ask, ‘Is there anything else I can help you with?’ It was the moral equivalent of the old surgical joke: the operation was successful but the patient died. The medical care was excellent but there was still something wrong, something that could have been done better, and I had to learn it.",

She is extremely intelligent, and having gained a first class degree in history at Oxford University, she is now halfway through her PhD. It is at times when her life is most stressful that she struggles with her anorexia. The first time she was admitted to hospital was when she was 13. She was being badly bullied at school and had stopped eating in order to become thin to prevent being teased about being overweight. Being able to lose so much weight gave her the sense that she had some control over at least one aspect of her life. Ophelia has spent the past 14 years in and out of hospital. On two occasions she had to be admitted to intensive care as she had lost consciousness. During these admissions she was fed by a nasogastric tube. She also has a history of obsessive-compulsive disorder and has been receiving cognitive behavioural therapy. A year ago she had managed to stabilise her weight at 50 kg – she is 1.7 m tall. With the stress of her PhD and the breakdown of her relationship with her boyfriend, when you initially see Ophelia she weighs less than 35 kg. Although you want to feed her by nasogastric tube to prevent her needing a third admission to intensive care, she adamantly refuses to have this. She tells you that she does not want to die, but neither does she want to be force fed. She is extremely frail and needs constant supervision by a healthcare assistant. Due to a shortage of beds on the psychiatric ward, Ophelia is currently being nursed on a general ward. The older women in her bay are complaining about the amount of personal attention she is receiving, as when they need assistance to change position or to go to the bathroom there is often a long wait due to staff shortages.\nQuestions\n• What is principlism?\n• How can the four principles be applied to this case scenario to offer guidance to the doctor about whether Ophelia should be force fed?",

One female patient has become upset because he keeps going to stand at the end of her bed and stares at her. The nurses are worried that as well as upsetting other patients, he is very unsteady on his feet and they fear he may fall over and injure himself. You read his notes to try to find a cause for his confusion. You learn that Micky, 76 years old, was an elective admission yesterday for a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Two weeks earlier he had been admitted to Accident and Emergency with shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. He was kept in for 3 days and treated with intravenous antibiotics. There are at least two possible causes for his confusion: a recurrence of his pneumonia (or other sepsis) or a reaction to the general anaesthetic. You decide to speak to Micky and try to take some blood. Micky refuses to cooperate and actively pushes you away from him, shouting and swearing. He then tries to leave the ward, claiming he is well enough to go home and it is illegal for you to keep him a prisoner.

He is acutely unwell. Investigations reveal that he has right lobar pneumonia. He also has dementia and ischaemic heart disease. Despite intravenous antibiotics and fluids, he does not make much improvement over the next few days. He is lethargic, yet occasionally agitated and needs full nursing care. You decide to discuss his medical issues with his wife and son to see how they had been coping at home before the pneumonia. You discover that there had been a gradual decline in his general well-being over the past 6 months. In particular, his son comments how his father seemed to have had increasing difficulty swallowing. He used to hold food in his mouth for long periods of time before swallowing and had choked on several occasions. You decide to get a swallowing assessment. The speech and language therapist grades him as unsafe to swallow and he is made nil by mouth. A nasogastric tube is inserted so that he can continue to be fed but he pulls it out on three occasions. He continues to deteriorate and his albumin drops due to sustained lack of intake. The only way to improve this would be to insert a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, but you feel that in a patient with so many comorbidities this may not be in his best interests. You discuss the pros and cons of PEG feeding with the patient’s relatives. You explain to them that without a PEG you can let him return home and continue to eat normally but that this may result in a fatal aspiration pneumonia at some point. The alternative is a PEG tube and keeping the patient nil by mouth permanently. A PEG tube is associated with a mortality of 3% and serious complications. You inform the relatives that the medical opinion of the team is to allow the patient to return home but that you would be willing to consider a PEG if the family felt that the patient would continue to have a good quality of life with one.\nQuestions\n• What is narrative ethics?\n• Which ‘voices’ should be listened to in this scenario?",

He was clearing out a gutter when he fell off the ladder and hit his head on the pavement. Passers-by immediately called an ambulance, and he was taken straight to theatre, where a large subdural haematoma was drained. Subsequent tests indicate that he fell from his ladder because he suffered a massive myocardial infarction. He has yet to recover consciousness, and it is thought that he has had irreparable brain damage due to anoxia. He is married and has three sons. His eldest son works as a radiographer in the hospital. His second son is an evangelist with the Pentecostal church, is married and has three young children. His youngest son is travelling around Australia. The intensive care unit has a family room, which has been taken over by Xavier’s family. It is also constantly filled with well-wishers from the church who hold prayer and song meetings around the clock. Relatives of other patients are complaining about the lack of access to the family room and the noise levels. However, when the senior staff nurse asks them to keep the noise down, Xavier’s son threatens the hospital with legal action for religious discrimination. He also says that the hospital is impeding the chances of his father’s recovery because if they cannot hold a prayer meeting, the hospital is preventing the possibility of a miracle from God. Despite full active medical treatment and round-the-clock prayers, Xavier makes no improvement over the next 6 weeks. The medical team decides to discuss the possibility of allowing him to die in peace by withdrawing supportive medical intervention. He has multi-organ failure and has not regained consciousness. Xavier’s wife and one son refuse point blank to allow this to happen and insist that everything be done for him, including resuscitation. The staff on the unit are becoming upset that Xavier is not being allowed to die with peace and dignity. \nXavier’s eldest son supports the advice of the medical team and attempts to discuss it with his brother and mother. However, they threaten him with becoming a family outcast and divine retribution. They also continue to threaten the hospital with lawsuits as they do not believe that Xavier is being cared for properly. No joint decision is ever made, and after 11 weeks Xavier has a cardiac arrest and dies following a 60-minute cycle of resuscitation.\nQuestions\n• What are ‘rights’ and ‘duties’?\n• What is the difference between positive and negative rights?\n• Who has ‘rights’ in the above scenario?",

He explains that she is\nunlikely to be able to breathe on her own at the moment, and that it may well be in her best\ninterests to remove her from the ventilator and withdraw intensive support rather than pro-\nlonging her suffering.

He has had\nsurgery and is due to start a treatment protocol that involves radiotherapy and chemotherapy.\nHis parents (who were married at the time of his birth) are now separated, and although his\nfather agrees to the treatment protocol, his mother is strongly opposed to radiotherapy. She is\nvery worried about the impact it may have on surrounding brain tissue, citing evidence that\nit may reduce his IQ and make him infertile. The treating team is worried that his chances of\nsurvival will be much decreased if he does not have radiotherapy, which has been shown to\nincrease the chance of disease-free survival from 35% to 80%.\nHis mother wants to explore other treatment options, including an alternative form of\nradiotherapy called proton beam irradiation (which is not recommended for this type of\ntumour in this country) or using hyperbaric oxygen rather than any form of radiother-\napy. The clinicians are very worried that any delay in treatment will reduce the chances\nof the radiotherapy being successful.

Rachel had repeatedly expressed concerns about the size\nof the foetus and about the risk that the baby might be too big to be delivered vaginally but\nshe had not asked her consultant specifically about this risk.\nDuring the birth the baby did develop shoulder dystocia. There was a 15-minute delay\nbetween the baby’s head appearing and the delivery, and during this time the baby was\ndeprived of oxygen. At a few months old, her son was diagnosed as suffering from severe\ncerebral palsy, caused by deprivation of oxygen. If Rachel had been given the option of having\nan elective caesarean section her son would have been born uninjured.\nQuestions\n• What information should be discussed with patients prior to consent for a\nproce dure?\n• What if a patient does not ask questions about risks?\n• Can a doctor not disclose information about risks if he thinks that information will\nbe harmful to the patient?",

He had flight of ideas and pressured speech and was quite agitated.\nMultiple investigations ruled out a physical cause for these new symptoms, and in light of his\nprevious medical history oral antipsychotic medication was started.\nOver the next few days his mental state worsened. He began making abusive phone calls to\nhis family, removing his oxygen, telling ward staff he was cured of his cancer and that he was\nbeing awarded a Nobel prize. Whilst happy to continue with his radiotherapy, John stopped\ntaking the antipsychotic medication prescribed by the psychiatrist.

He has a history of ischaemic heart disease but this is well controlled following\ncardiac stenting. He also has early signs of vascular dementia but can still interact with his\nenvironment. Following local clinical commissioning group (CCG) guidance the nursing\nhome has a policy that end-of-life decisions are discussed with patients and their relatives\nonce they have been given a chance to settle in. Part of this involves asking the resident about\nhis wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nGiven the medical situation, you believe Tim should not be for resuscitation because the\nharms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are significant for a person in his physical\ncondition (it is likely that his ribs may break with compressions) and, even if successful at\nrestarting his heart, it is likely that this will only prolong his life by a few months given his\npast history. The nursing home manager informs you that Tim has an extensive family and at\nleast one member visits him daily.\nDuring one of your weekly visits you decide to chat with Tim about his end-of-life wishes.\nHis grandson is also present. Tim does not recognise you from your previous visits, but Dave,\nTim’s grandson, tells you that he seems very settled in the nursing home. His grandfather\nloves to have visits from his family, ‘even though he doesn’t really know who we are’ and\nhe takes great pleasure from the small things in his life, like sitting in the sun in a comfy\narmchair with a cup of tea.\nQuestions\n• Who makes a decision whether to make a Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary\nResuscitation (DNACPR) order?\n• Does this need to be discussed with the patient/the patient’s family/carers?\n• What if the family objects to the DNACPR?",

        "case": "CASE 100:\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ILLNESS\nI was a final-year medical student when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma. In the\nspace of 3 weeks I went from initial presentation at the general practitioner to disease diagno-\nsis, including grading and staging. Pretty impressive, considering this involved going for two\nconsultations (one with a hospital specialist), a blood test, chest X-ray, computed tomography\n(CT) scan, fine needle aspiration and biopsy under general anaesthetic. My world had been\nturned upside down.\nLooking back, the majority of those 3 weeks are a hazy memory. However, my first consulta-\ntion with the hospital specialist remains in my head, but for all the wrong reasons. Initially\nthere were no introductions, which meant I had no idea who anyone was. I remember there\nbeing another person in the room besides the doctor, my mother and myself. I assumed at\nthe time that she was a student nurse, but this is pure supposition based on my own experi-\nences as a student in outpatient clinics. I certainly was not asked whether I minded her being\npresent and she did not say or do anything to indicate that her being there was necessary. The\nconsultant appeared in a hurry and spent most of the consultation speaking to my mother\nabout everything that had happened, despite the fact that at 23, I was not only the patient, but\nalso a competent adult (and nearly qualified medical professional!).\nThe worst thing about the consultation was the provisional diagnosis. It was not broken to me\nin the way I would have expected. The consultant asked me what I thought was wrong with\nme. By that point, most differentials had been ruled out; the only one left was Hodgkin’s, yet\nstill I thought I was just being a hypochondriac. I made my suggestion and the consultant\nresponded, but not with the answer I’d been expecting: ‘Yes, I think it is Hodgkin’s too’. From\nthat point on, the rest of that consultation is a blur. I can’t remember any of the other informa-\ntion I was given; my mind had gone into overdrive and the only thing I could think was that I\nhad cancer and might die. A week later, after the diagnosis had been confirmed histologically,\nI went for CT staging. Again, I found this a terrifying experience. I was scared it might show\nthe cancer had already metastasised, but also of having the scan itself. Nobody had explained\nthe procedure to me – that I would need to be cannulated and have intravenous contrast\ninjected. By the time I got into the CT scanner, I was hysterically upset. A form was thrust\nat me, which I was asked to sign. To this day I have no idea what I signed for, whether it was\nto consent to the scan, confirm I didn’t have any allergies to iodine/ shellfish or to confirm\nI wasn’t pregnant.\nDespite having spent 2 years on hospital ward as a student, being an inpatient while I received\nchemotherapy was a completely different experience. It made me really think about what my\nown patients must have been going through. There are things that you don’t appreciate as\na student (and perhaps even as a junior doctor). Privacy was a big problem. I was paranoid\nabout sleeping since everyone would see me and possibly hear me snore. I was constantly\ntired as the nurses are always coming to do observations or give drugs. Machines bleeping\nconstantly were also a huge annoyance! I was also always asked about how I was feeling and\nabout my intimate bodily functions in front of an entire ward of patients and relatives. It was\nalso very lonely being a patient; I would see doctors on their rounds for less than 10 minutes\nand then speak to no one till visiting hours in the afternoon.\nI spent 6 months as a patient, and thankfully now I’m a doctor. But my experience was\nmore valuable than any lectures or clinics, since it made me think a lot about the way we treat\nour patients.\nQuestions\n• Should I have been treated quicker just because I am a medical professional?\n• Should the consultant have assumed I knew what all the investigations and treat-\nments involved?\n• Is informed consent ever possible when a patient is scared? Or in pain? Or in emer-\ngency situations?\n\n10 years later … An update\nTen years on and I still reflect on my own personal experience as a patient. I have no doubt\nthat it strongly influenced my career choice, as I now specialie in palliative medicine. I rec-\nognise and accept that unfortunately, despite our best efforts as medical professionals, some-\ntimes patients die. In a strange way, I think being forced to confront my own mortality has\nenabled me to reconcile the fact that patients die too. Being able to ease patients’ suffering\nand support them and their families at such a difficult time is both rewarding and extremely\nhumbling.\nWhat I learnt through personal experience is echoed time after time by the patients I care for.\nPatients value honesty and clear and timely communication from the medical team. Lack of\ninformation leads to a sense of loss of control and a negative patient experience. In any medi-\ncal condition, the patient has already lost a degree of control, so anything a doctor can do to\nimprove that perception is welcomed by patients.\nSometimes ‘being alongside’ the patient is enough. You may not have all the answers and you\nmay not be able to solve their problem or cure their illness, but being there for the patient and\nlistening to them goes a very long way, and often doesn’t take up as much of your time as you\nthink it will.\nKindness is one of the most valuable clinical skills you have. Patients appreciate empathy; if\nyou treat every patient as you would wish a close relative to be treated, then it’s difficult to go\nfar wrong.\nOne of the biggest lessons I’ve learnt is that the human spirit is amazing. Even in the face\nof adversity, people can show great strength and resilience. Patients can teach us a lot, not\njust about medicine, but also about life itself. As health professionals, we are very privileged\nindeed to be able to do the job we do.",

        "case": "The case of Mr R\nMr R was born with a serious malformation of the brain and cerebral palsy. At eight months of age he developed severe epilepsy. At the age of 23 he had spastic diplegia (paralysis) and was incontinent, as well as apparently deaf and blind (with possible vestigial response to a buzzer and to light). He was unable to walk, to sit upright or to chew; so that food had to be syringed to the back of his mouth. His bowels had to be evacuated manually because his limited diet resulted in serious constipation. He suffered from thrush and had ulcers all the way through his guts, according to testimony. When cuddled he did indicate pleasure, and he also appeared to respond to pain by grimacing. Although he was not comatose, nor in a persistent vegetative state, his awareness on a scale of 1 to 10 was rated somewhere between 1 and 2 in an assessment by Dr Keith Andrews of the Royal Hospital for Neurodisability at Putney, London, who said:\nIt is my opinion that he has very little, if any, real cognitive awareness at a level where he can interpret what is going on in his environment. He reacts at the most basic level by responding to comfort, warmth and a safe environment by being relaxed and producing the occasional smile. He responds to discomfort, pain and threatening situations by becoming distressed and crying. These are very basic level responses and do not imply any thought processes.\nUntil he was 17 Mr R lived at home, where he was totally dependent on his devoted parents. He then moved to a residential home, but continued to return home at weekends. Now his condition was beginning to deteriorate: his weight had dropped to just over 30 kg, and he was extremely frail, suffering from recurrent chest infections, bleeding from ulceration of the oesophagus, and continued epileptic fits. In 1995 he was admitted to hospital on five occasions, each time for a life-threatening crisis.\nAfter the last crisis Dr S, the consultant psychiatrist for learning difficulties who was responsible for his care, wrote:\nTo hospitalize Mr R if he had another life-threatening crisis would, in my clinical judgement, be nothing more than striving officiously to keep him alive for no gain to him. In my opinion, this is tantamount to a failing against a basic duty of humanity. Indeed, at the last few admissions to hospital, I have had real concern as to whether it was ethical to treat him actively. That said, I would never withhold treatment against the wishes of his parents. In summary, taking R’s best interests into account and whilst taking into account the basic premise of the sanctity of human life, it is in my judgement unquestionably in R’s best interests to allow nature to take its course next time he has a life-threatening crisis and to allow him to die with some comfort and dignity. That would relieve him of physical, mental and emotional suffering.\nNow please continue with your reading of the case.\nThe immediate question now was whether to resuscitate Mr R in the event of another acute admission resulting in cardiac arrest. He was so frail that it was feared CPR (cardio-pulmonary resuscitation) might crush his ribcage. In addition, there was a risk of further brain damage from resuscitation. A subsidiary question was whether to administer antibiotics if he developed pneumonia. After Mr R’s fifth hospital admission, in September 1995, the consultant, Dr S, discussed the position with Mr R’s parents. They agreed that Mr R would not be subjected to CPR if he suffered a cardiac arrest in future. Accordingly, Dr S signed a DNR (do not resuscitate) direction, signed by Mr R’s mother under the heading ‘next of kin’. This decision was opposed by staff at the day care centre which Mr R had been attending; they felt that he did in fact have some ‘quality of life’. In addition they interpreted Dr S’s decision as a ‘no treatment’ policy, which Dr S denied: the only treatment which she was withholding, she argued, was cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. Agreement could not be reached, and a member of the day care centre staff applied for review of the decision by a court, on the basis of information provided by social workers involved in Mr R’s day care.\nThe basis of the application was that the DNR decision was irrational and unlawful in permitting medical treatment to be withheld on the basis of an assessment of the patient’s quality of life. The hospital sought a court judgement that, despite Mr R’s inability to give a valid refusal of treatment, it would be lawful and in his best interests to withhold cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and the administration of antibiotics. However, a proposed gastrostomy would be performed, underlining that there was no question of a comprehensive refusal to treat Mr R. Likewise, the hospital decided that it would ventilate Mr R and provide artificial nutrition and hydration if applicable, although initially it had indicated it would not. The application made it clear that the hospital intended to furnish such treatment and nursing care as may from time to time be appropriate to ensure that [R] suffers the least distress and retains the greatest dignity until such time as his life comes to an end.\nIn the High Court hearing, where Mr R was represented by the Official Solicitor (who acts on behalf of incompetent patients), discussion centred on guidelines for resuscitation issued by the British Medical Association (BMA) in 1993 in a joint statement with the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). It has been argued that resuscitation, originally devised to be used in a small minority of cases, is sometimes over-used (Hilberman et al., 1997). Although the technique can be very successful in the right context, in some US states it has become the default response to cardiac arrest, that is, it is required unless it is explicitly refused or clearly ‘futile’. Yet cardiac arrest is part of death. But was Mr R dying?\nIt is also wrong to think that CPR necessarily will work for every patient. Because it might not do so, we nowadays prefer to talk of DNAR orders; in instructing ‘do not attempt resuscitation’, we make it clearer to patients, their families and even the healthcare professionals that CPR can sometimes be tried, but there is no guarantee that it will revive every patient (British Medical Association et al., 2007).\nThe 1993 BMA/RCN guidelines, as used in relation to Mr R, did not actually say that resuscitation must always be attempted unless the patient is clearly in a terminal condition. Instead, they suggested three types of case in which it is appropriate to consider a DN(A)R decision:\n(a) Where the patient’s condition indicates that effective cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is unlikely to be successful\n(b) Where CPR is not in accord with the recorded sustained wishes of the patient who is mentally competent\n(c) Where successful CPR is likely to be followed by a length and quality of life which would not be acceptable to the patient.\nCondition (a) is the most obviously clinical of the three. It seems to focus solely on the medical facts of the matter. Certainly Mr R is gravely ill, but he has come through five acute admissions in the past year, so it is difficult to say that he is definitely unlikely to survive CPR. Condition (b) cannot be met, because Mr R is not mentally competent to record a wish. Finally, we have condition (c), focusing on unacceptable quality of life – but again, the guidance talks of this being acceptable or unacceptable to the patient. It is very hard to know whether Mr R gets any enjoyment out of life: he seems to respond to being cuddled, and to react to pain, but that is really all we can say. The BMA guidelines did note that ‘If the patient cannot express a view, the opinion of others close to the patient may be sought regarding the patient’s best interests.’ But, although the situation is nowadays different in England, the 1993 guidelines do not say that opinion has anything more than advisory value as to what the patient would regard as reasonable quality of life. (We will consider the views of his family again in a moment.) The guidelines also appear to envision a different kind of situation – where a previously competent patient, who (unlike Mr R) had expressed definite views about good and bad quality of life, is no longer able to enunciate his or her wishes, but where the family will remember his or her preferences.\nSo, strictly speaking, it is possible to make a case for arguing that none of these conditions applies to Mr R. But that was not the opinion of the court. Prompted by guidance from Keith Andrews as an expert witness, the court agreed that conditions (b) and (c) were not applicable – ruling out the quality of life arguments both for and against. Only condition (a) was to be considered, that is, the likelihood rather than the desirability of successful CPR. Even in hospital settings only about 13% of patients receiving CPR survive to discharge, Dr Andrews testified; in a residential home such as the one Mr R lived in, the chances would be ‘virtually nil’. Accordingly, the case turned on the alleged futility of treatment, rather than on the quality of Mr R’s life. On the basis of medical futility, the Court accepted the DNAR order, but not a global policy against other interventions by the consultant when and if a potentially life-threatening infection arose.",

It seemed that he would at some point need—and he wanted to receive—artificial nutrition and hydration. Guidance had been formulated by the General Medical Council (GMC) in the UK about when life-supporting treatment might, and might not, be offered to patients like Mr Burke, and he feared that the guidance indicated that he would not be eligible to receive artificial food and fluids. He was most concerned that, if he lost his mental competence, the doctors would be entitled to stop (or not start) this treatment, with the effect that his life would come to an end.\r\nMr Burke approached the court, arguing that the guidance violated his human rights under the European Convention on Human Rights, which had been incorporated directly into English law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Mr Burke specifically objected to the infringement of his right to life, his right to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, his right to determine what treatment he should receive and his right to equal respect before the law irrespective of any physical or mental disability.",

        "case": "The Terri Schiavo case\nTerri Schiavo was only 26 when she collapsed at home\nand experienced severe oxygen deprivation (anoxia)\nfor several minutes. She was hospitalized and under-\nwent placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastro-\nstomy tube (PEG) because she could not swallow. Four\nmonths later, with no amelioration of her condition,\nshe was judged to be in a persistent vegetative state.\nUnder the laws of Flordia, where the Schiavos\nlived, Terri’s husband Michael was appointed her\nlegal guardian, since she was judged incompetent to\ndecide on her own care and had not executed an\nadvance directive. Alongside Terri’s parents, Robert\nand Mary Schindler, Michael worked with the clini-\ncians to try to overcome Terri’s condition by means of\nall available therapies, but after several years there was\nstill no improvement.\nAt this point Michael Schiavo and the Schindlers\nbegan to disagree over what should be done. Michael\nbelieved that Terri’s condition was irreversible\nand that she would not have wanted to be kept alive\nin a persistent vegetative state. Her parents, in con-\ntrast, wanted to maintain her artificial hydration and\nnutrition. The matter was taken to the courts when\nMichael Schindler petitioned for an independent\ndetermination of Mrs Schiavo’s terminal condition’,\nincluding the decision to continue or discontinue life-\nprolonging procedures (cited in Perry et al., 2005,\np. 745).\nBut how firm was the diagnosis of persistent veg-\netative state? Since the case of Tony Bland, a series of\nmuch-publicized examples had appeared to indicate\nthat some minimal degree of function might still be\nretained by certain patients diagnosed as being in PVS\n(Andrews et al., 1996; Bauby, 1997). In reply to a\nsubsequent critic who claimed that Terri Schiavo was\nactually in a ‘locked in state’ rather than true PVS,\nhowever, the bioethicist Art Caplan thundered:\n\nI would like to have him find three neurologists\nwho agree with that claim. Terri Schiavo suffered\nanoxia to her brain twice! Her brain damage was\nconfirmed while she was alive by CAT scan and\nthen at autopsy. She was blind despite the alleged\ntapes that were made showing her tracking\nobjects. Her cortex had shriveled to half its normal\nmass.\n(Caplan, 2009)\n\nIn January 2000 a trial was held to settle the issue of Mrs\nSchiavo’s future, with both sides presenting witnesses.\nThe question, presiding Judge Greer said, was whether\nshe would choose to have her artificial feeding and\nhydration continued if she were competent. Clear evi-\ndence of Mrs Schiavo’s previously expressed wishes was\nadmissible under Florida law, even if only made orally.\nIt was held that the diagnosis of PVS in Mrs\nSchiavo was indeed valid: the court found that she\nmet the statutory definition of the persistent vegetative\nstate and that there was no hope of her regaining\nconsciousness or the ability to communicate (Perry\net al., 2005, p. 746). Given that finding, the next issue\nwas how Mrs Schiavo’s autonomy rights could be\nexercised and what her true wishes would have been\nif she were competent. The trial judge ruled in favour\nof Mr Schiavo, who had produced three witnesses to\naffirm that his wife had previously declared she would\n‘not want to live like that’. The feeding tube was\nordered to be removed.\nRefusing to accept this outcome, the Schindlers\ntook the case to appeal. By this point their daughter\nhad been diagnosed as being in PVS for 10 years. The\nappellate court upheld the ruling of the lower court on\nboth clinical and legal grounds, likewise ordering that\nthe feeding tube should be removed.\nBefore the order could be put into effect, however,\nthe Schindlers presented evidence before a second trial\njudge from other expert witnesses (none of whom had\nactually examined Terri) and succeeded in obtaining a\nfurther evidentiary hearing. They also claimed that\nnew and better medical treatments for brain damage\nhad become available since the initial trial. The case\nwas referred back to Judge Greer, but he again ruled\nthat Mr Schiavo’s experts were more likely to be cor-\nrect and that the supposed new remedies were not\naccepted by the mainstream neurological community\nas having a firm evidence base. On a second appeal in\n2002, Judge Greer’s decision was scrutinized and\nupheld as a cautious legal standard designed to pro-\nmote the value of life (cited in Perry et al., 2005,\np. 746). This was the sequel:\n‘\n– With Terri Schiavo’s personalized decision deter-\nmined at the 2000 trial and her medical condition\nconclusively confirmed at the 2002 hearing, arti-\nficial hydration and nutrition were stopped for\nthe second time, on 15 October 2003, pursuant to\ncourt order. This order was superseded 6 days later\nwhen the Florida legislature passed and Governor\nJeb Bush signed Terri’s Law, which provided the\ngovernor unfettered discretion to order resump-\ntion of Mrs. Schiavo’s medical treatment.\nEleven months later, the Florida Supreme Court\nheld Terri’s Law unconstitutional as a violation of\nseparation of powers, and a third date was set for\nremoval of the PEG tube. On 18 March 2005, the\ntube was removed for the final time, and despite\nthe intervention of Congress and President George\nW. Bush, Terri Schiavo’s saga ended with her death\non 31 March 2005.\n(Perry et al., 2005, p. 748)",

        "case": "The case of Diane Pretty\nDiane Pretty had motor neurone disease, a condition that progressively attacks the sufferer’s muscles, leaving them increasingly dependent on others to perform even the most basic tasks. Although she had, in her own words, ‘fought this disease each step of the way’, Mrs Pretty felt that her prognosis was bleak and she was especially concerned at the possibility that she might suffocate in the final stages of her life (Dyer, 2002).\nRather than succumb to increasing dependency and a possibly distressing demise, Diane Pretty wished to obtain assistance in committing suicide, which her husband Brian was willing to provide. However, the law in England clearly condemns any such assistance: whilst suicide itself is lawful, assisting suicide is a crime that (according to the Suicide Act 1961) carries a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. Rather than risk her husband being convicted and incarcerated, Mrs Pretty wanted confirmation from a legal official that no action would be taken against him. The official in question, the Director of Public Prosecutions, declined to make any such statement and so Mrs Pretty approached the courts in an attempt to demonstrate that the legal prohibition on assisted suicide violated her human rights.\nMrs Pretty insisted that her rights were being infringed in five ways. First, she claimed that her right to life granted her the right to determine when her life could come to an end – that is, the right to life was a right that she could waive. Secondly, she argued that the state prohibition on assisted suicide meant that she was being forced to endure an inhuman and degrading existence. Thirdly, the right to personal autonomy or privacy entailed that her autonomous decision to die be respected. Fourthly, Mrs Pretty argued that she had a right to freedom of thought and that, as such, her right to believe in the justifiability of assisted suicide should translate into her (and her husband) being free to act in accordance with this belief. Finally, Mrs Pretty pointed to the right to be free from unjust discrimination; since able-bodied persons were freely entitled to commit suicide, Mrs Pretty argued that she – as a disabled person – was being treated unfairly by the law.\nMrs Pretty’s case reached the (then) highest court in England, the House of Lords. The five Law Lords decided, unanimously, that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe Mrs Pretty’s rights (or indeed anyone else’s).\nThe right to life, they explained, did not encompass a ‘right to die’; indeed, this would be contrary to the very purpose of the right, which was to uphold the sanctity of human life. Moreover, the Law Lords were not convinced that it was the legal policy (and therefore the UK government) which was the cause of Mrs Pretty’s suffering – the true cause of this was her disease, and the only obligation owed by the state was a duty to ensure that her suffering was adequately alleviated (which fell short of enabling her to have her life ended).\nThe judges were even less persuaded by Mrs Pretty’s arguments about freedom of thought. Just because Mrs Pretty believed that assisted suicide was morally justified did not mean that the state had to recognize her right to engage in this. The Law Lords further rejected the idea that Mrs Pretty was being unjustly dealt with by the law, not least since they found no (legal) support for the idea that the decriminalization of suicide amounted to a legal ‘right to commit suicide’.\nThe House of Lords also resisted Mrs Pretty’s seemingly central claim that her decision ought to be respected since it was autonomously reached. Respect for autonomy, they reasoned, only entitled an individual to be free in the way they lived their life – and the right did not extend to seeking its ending. The judges added that, even if they were wrong about this, there were important social interests at stake (like the preservation of the sanctity of life) that justified placing limits on what an autonomous individual could do.\nMrs Pretty was neither impressed with the Law Lords’ decision nor deterred from advancing her cause. Using the same human rights arguments, she approached the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Once again, and for the final time, Mrs Pretty’s case failed. However, the European court differed from the English court in one respect: it was willing to concede that Mrs Pretty did have a right to respect for her autonomous decisions, even a decision to die. It nevertheless concluded that it was for the UK government to decide whether there were more important social interests at stake that prevented the right from prevailing.\nMrs Pretty succumbed to her disease less than two weeks after she had lost her case in Strasbourg. Unfortunately, she appears to have endured the very breathing difficulties that she had fought to avoid (Dyer, 2002).",

        "case": "The case of Dr Chabot\nA landmark in this respect has been the so-called Chabot case (Griffiths, 1995). The defendant was a psychiatrist named Boudewyn Chabot, who in September 1991 supplied to Mrs Boomsma, at her request, lethal drugs which she consumed in the presence of the defendant, her GP, and a friend. She died half an hour later.\nMrs Boomsma was 50 years old; she had married at 22, but from the beginning the marriage was unhappy. In 1986 her eldest son committed suicide. From that time on her marital problems grew worse and her husband more violent; her wish to die began to take shape, but she said that she remained alive only to care for her younger son. In 1988 she left her husband, taking her younger son with her. In 1990 her son was admitted to hospital in connection with a traffic accident, and was found to be suffering from cancer, from which he died in May 1991. That same evening Mrs Boomsma attempted suicide with drugs she had put by, but did not die. She then approached the Dutch Association for Voluntary Euthanasia, which put her in touch with Dr Chabot.\nMrs Boomsma was diagnosed as suffering from an adjustment disorder, consisting of a depressed mood, without psychotic signs, in the context of a complicated bereavement process. Although her condition was in principle treatable, treatment would probably have been protracted and the chance of success small. But she rejected therapy, despite Dr Chabot’s best efforts to persuade her. He became convinced that she was experiencing intense, long-term psychic suffering which was unbearable for her, and which held out no prospect of improvement. Her request for assistance with suicide in his opinion was well-considered. In letters and discussion with him, she presented the reasons for her decision clearly and consistently, showing that she understood her situation and the consequences of her decision. In his judgement, her rejection of therapy was also well-considered. Chabot consulted seven experts. None of them believed that there was any realistic chance of success, given Mrs Boomsma’s clear refusal of treatment.",

        "case": "Illness, pain, su ering and the value of life\nRon Berghmans\nIntroduction\nEthical issues related to end-of-life care concern phil-\nosophical questions about the goal(s) of medicine,\nand the place of pain, su ering and the value and\nmeaning of life of the patient. The story of my illness\nexperience and recovery as a cancer patient, on which\nthe following is based, contains three parts: the rst\nencompasses the period from complaint to nal diag-\nnosis (October 2003 July 2004); the second the\nperiod of treatment, recovery, relapse, and repeated\nand more intensive treatment and recovery (July\n2004 April 2006). The third is the one from de nite\nrecovery until the present time. In that period I suf-\nfered a stroke from which I recovered quickly and\nwith only slight residual e ects.\n\nMy personal story of illness, pain and su ering\nand the corresponding experience of life s meaning\nand value started in the autumn of 2003. At that time\nthe chronic back pain which I experienced in the\nlower parts of my back was increasing. As this was\ndi erent from normal I had been used to chronic\nback pain for a great part of my life late in October I\nturned to my general practitioner. She diagnosed the\nback pain as functional and non-speci c and pre-\nscribed pain-killers. Her advice was not to work too\nhard . . . As the pain kept increasing, after a few weeks I\nreturned to the general practitioner. Now she pre-\nscribed di erent pain killers which had as little e ect\nas the previous ones. As my condition worsened, I had\na third consultation during which I expressed my wish\nto have X-rays of my back. Only very reluctantly and\nafter much pressure did my GP agree to refer me to a\nradiologist in the academic hospital. X-rays of my\nlower back showed no real and serious anomalies,\nalthough there was some minor pathology at the\nvertebrae. It appeared that my GP was content to\nsee these particularities as the possible (probable)\ncauses of my pain. Nevertheless, my situation kept\nworsening as there was no therapy available to better\nmy condition.\n\nAfter consultations with di erent other medical\nprofessionals, nally it was July 2004, so more than\nhalf a year after the rst consultation with the GP an\nassistant neurosurgeon decided to scan the whole of\nmy back with MRI. On the basis of this scan it\nappeared that there was a process to be seen halfway\ndown my spinal cord. After taking a biopsy it was\nconcluded that I su ered from malignant B-cell non-\nHodgkin lymphoma and that it was localized in the\nabdomen and the bone marrow. This last detail\nexplained the seriousness of the pain I su ered.\n\nThe shock of a fatal diagnosis It is often said that a\ncancer diagnosis is experienced as a death sentence\nby the people involved. The patient s life is at stake,\nand although therapeutic prospects in many cancers\nhave improved particularly in the case of non-\nHodgkin lymphoma for most people the prospect\nof premature death will be the rst thought when a\ncancer diagnosis is communicated. The knowledge of\na cancer diagnosis implies that the patient and his\nfamily and friends need to relate to this new and\nmostly unexpected fact. One cannot escape the\nneed to give a place to the illness and the future\nprospects regarding treatment (if applicable) and pre-\nmature death.\n\nBecoming aware of the real signi cance and poten-\ntial impact of the diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma\ncertainly was not something which happened immedi-\nately after it became clear that there was something\nseriously wrong in my body. Additional diagnostic\nprocedures were in some way a distraction from what\nreally was the case, as if as such these procedures\nalready improved my future prospects. So the shock\nof a fatal diagnosis was not really a shock, but some-\nthing which evolved in the diagnostic process and\nduring treatment. In my opinion this phenomenon\na ects bioethical and legal notions of informed consent\nand refusal of treatment, as these notions are tightly\nconnected to communicative aspects during the\nillness course, as well as psychological, social and cul-\ntural factors which relate to defence mechanisms,\ndistortion of information, and cultural habits and\nvalues.\n\nHope Some claim that hope is the crucial factor in\nthe care for patients with cancer. Hope involves the\nprospect that in the future there will be a cure, or at\nleast a prospect of a life with an acceptable quality for\nthe patient. During the di erent treatments I have\nundergone chemotherapy, radiation therapy and\nautologous stem-cell transplantation I have experi-\nenced a lot of support from the idea that at the end of\nthe tunnel there would be the light of a successful\ntreatment, even though I was aware that this chance\nwas real, but de nitely not a guarantee. Above that I\ngranted myself the outlook that I would have the luck\nto belong to the statistical group of patients who\nwould survive the lymphoma (about 50% of all su er-\ners). This promoted ghting spirit and gave strength\nduring di cult times.\n\nIsolation In a case of severe illness (together with\nburdensome medical treatments like chemotherapy\nand radiation) the patient becomes more and more\ninvolved with and focused on the illness and the\ntreatments. In my case, the experience of intense\nand enduring pain isolates the person from his\nsurroundings. The physical environment has little\nor no meaning and personal contact becomes di -\ncult, as the person is almost exclusively involved\nwith and focused on the pain he experiences. This\nintroversion increases the vulnerability of the\npatient who has di culty in expressing his or her\nneeds and wishes; this implies a need for carers to\nbe sensitive to the unexpressed needs the patient\nmay have. An illustration in my experience was the\npressure sores on my back, which went undetected\nfor some time.\n\nContemplating wishes in advance As it became clear\nthat my illness might progress in such a way that my\nlife would end during or after treatment, I decided\nthat it would be helpful to draft an advance directive\nstating my medical wishes in case I became uncon-\nscious or otherwise incompetent. When drafting the\nadvance directive together with my wife, we discov-\nered that it was not easy to formulate in an exact and\nunambiguous way my wishes regarding end-of-life\ntreatment and care. It was particularly hard to delin-\neate care which would be acceptable, and care which\nwould not be acceptable. In drafting an advance\ndirective, one rst needs to be conscious of the values\nwhich lie at the basis of your concerns about care at\nthe end of life. On the basis of these values it becomes\npossible to give practical guidance to carers and rel-\natives. In any case, I learned that debating my wishes\nwith my wife gave me the con dence that in case I\nbecame incompetent and decisions ought to be\nmade, then my wife would be in a good position to\nact as my representative on the basis of my personal\nvalues and wishes. It seems to me that the involve-\nment of a person who is close to the patient can\nprovide much better and more valuable input into\nthe process of medical (and ethical) decision-making\nat the end of life than any formal advance document.\nAt the same time I am aware that this is the ideal case\nin which there is a formal advance directive together\nwith a person who has knowledge of the concerns\nand wishes of the patient.\n\nHopelessness My experience with severe pain is\nlargely connected to the pre-diagnosis period\n(October 2003 July 2004). Central in this period was\nthe continuous back pain which coloured my exis-\ntence and that of my family and friends.\nAs the pain became unbearable, the rehabilita-\ntion physician who was in charge of my physical\ncondition would give an injection with corticoste-\nroids. The e ects were really miraculous. The rst\ntime, within two hours the pain was completely\ngone and kept away for six weeks. This gave me\nand my family the opportunity to spend ten happy\ndays in Tuscany. However, each subsequent injection\nhad less e ect, and after 4 or 5 injections the pain\nonly stayed away for less than 24 hours. The rehabil-\nitation physician discussed the issue and explained\nthat he thought it was useless to continue the use of\ncorticosteroids. I could not do other than agree, there\nwas no choice.\nLess than a week later as my condition kept\ngrowing worse the situation became unbearable.\nThe pain was continuously intense and I saw no pros-\npect of relief whatsoever. As there was no use in\nadministering corticosteroids, I contemplated suicide\nas an escape from this terrible lot. After a sleepless\nnight I remember it was early on a Saturday morn-\ning I called the rehabilitation physician. In my mind, I\nhad made the decision that if he was not willing to\ninject me once more with corticosteroids, I would\njump from the local bridge into the river.\n\nConfusion and broken communication Next to the\npain during the pre-diagnosis period, there was the\npain which accompanied the medical procedures\nparticularly the intensive chemotherapy which was\nfollowed by autologous stem-cell transplantation I\nreceived morphine by injection. This pain-killer was\ncontinuously infused by a syringe driver, and brie y\nafter the start of this I became seriously confused. This\nconfusion encompassed di erent experiences.\nThe rst experience was one of hallucinations:\npartly visual, and partly what I would call experiential.\nThe visual experience involved distortions of visual\nperception: when I looked out of the hospital window,\nI saw dancing construction cranes.\nThe second experience involved what may be\ncalled broken communication . This was very fright-\nening. As I had di culty expressing myself, I was\nunable to clarify my wishes, but particularly my con-\ncerns to others. An example was my conviction that\ntime had been xed.\nThe third experience involved unclearness about\nplace and time. Particularly at night I was disturbed\nabout my environment. I didn t exactly know where I\nwas, and why I was where I was staying. Besides that, I\ndidn t know the time or date, let s say the coordinates\nof my existence in time. As already mentioned, there\nwas a period in which I experienced time as being\nxed, which was particularly troublesome as I thought\nthat this eternal xation of time would imply that I\nwould have to stay in the hospital without end. This\nwas extremely frightening as I was eager to leave\nhospital as quickly as possible.\nIn particular, the experience of broken communi-\ncation was frightening because I could not get my\nworries and fears across to the people who were\ncaring for me: nurses and doctors. Only my wife was\nsensitive enough and able to see that my mental\ncondition was worrisome. Her intervention led to a\nreduction of the morphine dose, which resulted in a\npassing of the side e ects.\n\nUnbearable su ering The notion of unbearable suf-\nfering is di cult to assess. In a recent publication,\nmotivations of patients with a request for euthanasia\nor physician-assisted suicide were explored on the\nbasis of 10 patient-centred, qualitative studies (Dees\net al., 2009). This exploration showed that patients\nexpress their unbearable and unrelieved su ering in\nterms of pain, weakness, functional impairment,\ndependency, being a burden, hopelessness, indignity,\nintellectual deterioration, perception of loss of one-\nself, loss of autonomy, and being tired of life.\n‘\nThe authors of this article conclude that the point\nwhere su ering becomes unbearable is a very indi-\nvidual perception that is closely related to the person-\nality, the life history, social factors, and existential\nmotivations. Irreversible disintegration and humilia-\ntion of the person appeared to be the start of openly\nexploring the phenomenology of death. The circum-\nstances of their illness brought all the patients to the\npoint where they would rather die than continue to\nlive under the conditions imposed by their illness.\nThe unbearableness of su ering can be explored\nfrom two positions: the viewpoint and experience of\nthe su ering person, and the viewpo\n...[TRUNCATED]",

        "case": "Problems of paternalism and autonomy in a high-risk pregnancy\nGillian M. Lockwood\nIntroduction\nRenal transplantation, the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage renal failure, can correct the infertility due to chronic ill-health, anaemia and tubal damage generally encountered when these patients are managed by renal dialysis. Currently only one in 50 women of child-bearing age becomes pregnant following a renal transplant, and it may be that many more would welcome the chance of biological parenthood if their fertility problems could be overcome. The first successful pregnancy, conceived in 1956 following an identical twin renal transplant, was reported in 1963 (Murray et al., 1963).\nUntil recently pregnancy had been thought to present considerable hazards to the transplant recipient. However, some reviews (Sturgiss and Davison, 1992; Davison, 1994) have suggested that pregnancy in the graft recipient, unlike the rare pregnancy in patients undergoing dialysis, is usually likely to lead to a live birth, and the pregnancy may have little or no adverse effect on either renal function or blood pressure in the transplant recipient. The current medical consensus is that if, prior to conception, renal function is well preserved, and the patient does not develop high blood pressure, then only a minority of transplant recipients will experience a deterioration of their renal function attributable to pregnancy (Lindheimer and Katz, 1992).\nIt is inevitable that the rapid return to good health enjoyed by the majority of women following successful renal transplantation should encourage them to consider conception. Although only a small proportion of women with a functioning graft become spontaneously pregnant, modern Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs), especially in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF – ET), could theoretically increase this proportion to near-normal levels.\nPregnancy, especially if ART is required, clearly entails extra risks for the renal transplant recipient, but these are risks that, with appropriate counselling, the patient may be prepared and even eager to take.\nIn this paper, I shall discuss the ethical dilemmas involved in counselling renal transplant patients seeking pregnancy but requiring ART. This case concerned a couple with long-standing infertility by means of IVF – ET. The wife was a renal transplant recipient whose initial renal failure was due to severe, recurrent pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition of late pregnancy causing raised blood pressure and renal complications, which can progress to cause fits and cerebro-vascular accidents [strokes]. It is associated with severe growth retardation of the fetus, and often, premature delivery.\nA case of high-risk pregnancy\nA 34-year-old woman (Mrs A) was referred to an IVF unit following 8 years of failure to conceive after a reversal-of-sterilization operation had been performed (Lockwood et al., 1995). She had been born with only one poorly developed kidney, but this was not known until, at age 20, she was investigated for very severe pre-eclampsic toxaemia (PET), which she suffered during her first pregnancy. Her baby was born very premature at 26 weeks gestation, and he died shortly after birth from complications of extreme prematurity.\nA second pregnancy in the following year was also complicated by severe PET, renal damage, premature delivery at 26 weeks gestation and neonatal death. Sterilization by tubal ligation was offered and accepted under these circumstances, in view of the anticipated further deterioration of her renal function with any subsequent pregnancy. There was a significant further advance of her renal disease, necessitating the initiation of haemodialysis (a kidney machine) 2 years later, and a living, related donor renal transplant (from her mother) was subsequently performed. After the transplant, Mrs A remained well and maintained good kidney function on a combination of anti-rejection drugs, steroids and blood pressure tablets. At age 26, a reversal-of-sterilization operation was performed because she had become so distressed by her childlessness, but hysterosalpingography (a test to check for fallopian tubal patency) 2 years later, when pregnancy had not occurred, showed that both tubes had once again become blocked.\nAt the time that Mr and Mrs A were referred to the IVF unit, there were no case reports of successful IVF in women with renal transplants, but specialists were becoming increasingly reluctant to advise women with transplants against trying for a baby, as medical care for high-risk pregnancies was improving dramatically. Following discussion with the Transplantation Unit and the high-risk pregnancy specialists, the IVF unit felt that an IVF treatment cycle could be offered to Mr and Mrs A as long as the risks of IVF – ET, over and above those attendant upon a spontaneous pregnancy in these circumstances, were understood and accepted by the couple and minimized, as far as possible, by the IVF team.\nAn IVF treatment cycle was started using the normal drug regimen, but the patient was given a much lower dose than usual, with the aim of minimizing the effect of the hormone stimulation on the transplanted kidney. Two oocytes (eggs) were obtained, which fertilized normally in vitro, and the two embryos were transferred to the uterus (womb) 54 hours later. Mrs A’s pregnancy test was positive 13 days after embryo transfer, and an ultrasound scan performed at 8 weeks gestation showed a viable twin pregnancy.\nThroughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, the patient’s antirejection drugs (azathioprine and prednisolone) were continued at maintenance doses. Renal function was monitored closely throughout the treatment cycle and during pregnancy, remaining remarkably stable.\nThe pregnancy was complicated at 20 weeks gestation by a right deep vein thrombosis, affecting the femoral and external iliac veins, and anticoagulation with heparin and warfarin was required. Spontaneous rupture of the membranes, leading to premature delivery, occurred at 29 weeks gestation; the twins were delivered vaginally and in good condition three hours later. The twin girls were small for dates (at 1.48 and 1.19 kg) but were otherwise well, requiring only minimal resuscitation and respiratory support. After delivery of her babies, Mrs A remained well and her renal graft continued to function normally, with no change in immunosuppressive or antihypertensive (blood pressure) medication required.",

        "case": "pregnant through the technique of egg-donation IVF. In both instances, one could argue that as long as the risks associated with fertility treatment and pregnancy were thoroughly explained to and accepted by the woman (and her partner), then to refuse treatment on the sole ground that her health may deteriorate is unacceptably paternalistic on the part of the clinicians involved. Mrs A stated that if she had not agreed to the sterilization (which she claimed she had been placed under undue pressure to accept at the time she was diagnosed with renal failure), then she would not only have been able to, but definitely would have tried to, achieve a further pregnancy, as she did after the reversal of sterilization was performed.\nYour comparison of Lockwood and Overall has brought this chapter full circle, as have the issues of choice and vulnerability in this high-risk pregnancy. At the very start of this chapter we asked you to consider the implications of NRTs more broadly, and in particular for the women who undergo them. Lockwood’s patient Mrs A was vulnerable not only because of her clinical condition, but because of her deep desire to overcome her childlessness. Her pregnancy was clinically riskier than a normal pregnancy, but her feelings about riskiness and uncertainty mirror those experienced by both partners in the IVF context as well. New reproductive technologies have given hope to many couples, but they also create pressures and vulnerability which are not always acknowledged (Franklin and Roberts, 2006).\nThe Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 [operative at the time this case occurred, prior to the adoption of the revised law in 2008] also places great emphasis on the ‘interests of the child’ who may be born as a result of procedures such as IVF–ET. This emphasis has been interpreted by some authorities as encouraging fertility units to feel justified in refusing treatment to women with significant health problems (or to post-menopausal women) as it would, so they claim, not be in the ‘interests of the child’ to be born to a mother with reduced life expectancy due to chronic ill-health or comparatively advanced age. Apart from the obvious rejoinders that society happily countenances men becoming fathers at an age when their life expectancy is reduced, and the medical profession’s heroic efforts to assist women with serious health problems who become pregnant spontaneously, it is unquestionably in the interests of the child. After all, the child will only be born if his transplanted mother is offered fertility treatment, so that she should be offered such treatment even if he loses his mother at an early age or has to deal with the consequences of her ill-health, as otherwise he won’t exist!",

Believing herself to be at high risk of developing breast cancer because of familial patterns, and additionally concerned also for her own daughters, she asks her GP to refer her also for genetic testing for the mutations implicated in some breast cancers. The case raises practical ethical issues about patients and practitioners understanding of genetic testing, the right to know and genetic determinism, as well as the overall question of how someone like Beth can live with a degree of uncertainty which not even the most sophisticated genetic test can entirely dispel. The situation is further complicated by the fact that in cases where the test is carried out against the background of a family pedigree conferring high risk, a negative (i.e. good news) test result can fail to reduce risk sufficiently to take a woman out of a high-risk group and hence have no implications for screening/treatment.",

        "case": "I am definitely having it done\nJune Zatz\n\nI remember in 1973, when I was 23 years old, sitting in the hairdresser’s, reading some obscure American magazine. I came across an article about a 19-year- old girl from New York where every female on her mother’s side had contracted breast cancer, going back two or three generations. A decision was taken that she have both breasts removed as this was the only way to ensure that she would not contract the disease herself. I was absolutely aghast when I read this article. This was the first time I learnt that breast cancer was hereditary. My mother, her two sisters and her first cousin had had breast cancer but I never really thought of it as being a threat to me. And the thought of a 19-year-old having such a drastic operation! I never discussed the article with anyone. It was after reading the article that the implications were clearer to me – of contracting the disease. I dismissed as ridiculous the part in the article about the operation, but I know that I stored it away in the back of my mind.\nMy mother had a radical mastectomy when she was 42 years old. As a result of the operation she was left with fluid in her right arm, which caused severe infections where she was bedridden for days. She had bouts of ill-health for years but in between she was a determined lady who never complained. She had a second mastectomy 13 years later followed by various operations and bouts of ill-health. After a benign tumour was removed from her liver when she was 58, her consultant warned my brother and me that ‘cancer will get her sooner rather than later’. Her ultimate illness was when she was 66 years old, short and sharp – cancer of the spine – paralysis – painful – death even now, 7 years later, I cannot think of this period without immense pain.\nMy mother’s younger sister developed breast cancer when she was 46, and after numerous operations and great pain died 2 years later when 48 years old. This was prior to the days of the hospice (where my mother died) and so my mother looked after her, but the pain was not well controlled.\nMy other aunt died when I was only 7 years old. My mother told me she had breast cancer in her early 40s, but also had a heart condition from which she died in her mid-40s.\n\nAfter finding out that breast cancer can be hereditary, I read everything I could get my hands on. Only once when in my mid-20s I attempted to bring up the subject with my mother, as I felt perhaps she could get advice for me from her specialist. But she just dismissed it and refused to discuss it. I never attempted to mention it again. My husband, however, got to know of my fears because I often imagined I felt a lump in my breast. Then I became depressed, lay awake at night imagining all sorts of things and, having two young children, I naturally worried about the children – what would happen if I weren’t around for them? Throughout the years, I only ever went to the doctor twice when the ‘lump’ didn’t seem to disap- pear and I was literally going round the bend. Even when at the doctor’s I managed to conceal my true feelings, was very matter of fact, and he was never aware of the family history as I didn’t tell him.\nMy mother died 7 years ago, when I was 37 years old. Within a few weeks of her death, I realized that I had to do something about my fears and get them out in the open. It was almost as though with her death this released me to discuss my fears out in the open.\nI wrote to my mother’s oncologist detailing the family history and asking whether there was anything else I should be doing apart from self-examination. This resulted in me being referred to an oncology clinic for regular monitoring, initially 6-monthly, then annually. These visits to the clinic I can only describe as horrendous. First of all there was the waiting area where females of all ages (many surprisingly young) were waiting to find out whether they had breast cancer or because they already had it. Then, in the cubicles while waiting to be examined, you could hear the registrar in the next cubicle talking to the patient and I knew from the conversation that all was not well. By the time I was due to be examined, I would be a wreck – then the mammogram; then the waiting a week for the result. After the result I would be elated, my first thought would be thank God, I will be around for another year. I would immediately calculate all my children’s ages. This was what was of prime importance for me – I wanted to be around to see them into adulthood.\nAs I neared the age when my mother developed her first breast cancer, I became more fearful. Over the years I had read many articles and I did not feel that treatments were any more effective today than years ago, even if it were detected at an earlier stage. I felt that I would get breast cancer as my body was similar to my mother’s in many ways – she had fibroids and a hysterectomy – she had gall stones and had her gall bladder removed. I had had both these operations by my late 30s.\nMy mind kept casting back to the article I’d read all those years ago about the 19-year-old who had both breasts removed as a preventative measure. I had never read of this again but decided it was time to pursue it further. In the summer of 1991 I wrote to my oncologist asking if such an operation were possible. His answer took a fairly long time coming, mainly due to admin- istrative procedures. While I waited for the reply, I was on tenterhooks: my feelings were that I would be told that I was crazy, that this operation could be done only in America.\nEventually when his letter arrived stating that yes, I could have this operation – I literally couldn’t believe it – I read the letter over and over for days. Then I wrote another long letter with lots of questions. There followed several letters to and fro: a referral to a plastic surgeon to discuss reconstruction and a referral to a specialist cancer geneticist to discuss the genetic side of things.\nIt took me months to make up my mind definitely. After the second letter from the oncologist, I told my husband what I was investigating and he was horror- struck. He just could not understand why I should have both breasts removed when they were perfectly healthy. To him the logical thing was to wait and, if the cancer appeared, then it will have been caught early, then I should have a mastectomy. He didn’t understand that, the way I saw it, it was too late by then. At this stage, however, I hadn’t made up my mind and in fact because of my husband’s attitude I put things on hold for several weeks. One day, however, I woke up early feeling such anger and resentment towards him – he and I had always until now agreed on major issues.\nI discussed it with him again. This time I had a different attitude: he had made me feel selfish contem- plating such an operation but what I said to him was: ‘What about me, my fears; this is my life and who’s going to look after me if I get cancer – will he nurse me?’ At the same time I said I hadn’t yet made up my mind but I was going to continue my inves- tigations whether he liked it or not. He listened and said he’d like to come with me when I next had a consultation with either the oncologist or the plastic surgeon. I refused as I knew he was still against it but said I’d tell him everything they said.\nSome days I would wake up and say, ‘I’m definitely having it done’. Other days I’d think I was crazy – I tried to imagine what it would be like without breasts, although there was the chance of reconstruction. Gradually my husband came round to my way of thinking. The more information I gathered the more he understood what I could be facing. One day I said, ‘I don’t think I’ll have it done’, and then to my surprise he said, ‘You should go ahead – I’d rather have you alive and well with no breasts’.\nIn April 1992 I made the decision to have the operation. Throughout the 6 months it took me to come to this decision I had several consultations with the three specialists. The clinical geneticist put me in touch with another lady who had had a similar oper- ation. She had an almost identical family history to mine. I had a long discussion with her on the phone. It was invaluable to talk to someone who had been in my situation. She and her sister had had the operation and were greatly relieved that the chance of breast cancer had been removed.\nThe only people who knew about it were my husband, my two children and two friends, one of whom had a medical background and the other was a cousin to whom I’m very close and with whom I’d often discussed the ‘family history’. I instinctively knew from the beginning that I didn’t want anyone’s advice on the matter, I wanted facts on which I could base my decision. The professionals were wonderful. Everyone was patient, answered my questions, was quietly supportive and never offered advice on what I should do. I should also point out that they were all males.\nAt the time my daughter was 18 years old and my son 16. They knew what was happening but my daughter could not understand my contemplating such an operation, so I didn’t discuss it with her, and my son couldn’t deal with it at all perhaps due to his age and sexuality.\nThe plastic surgeon had discussed the breast reconstruction he would be performing, which involved a lengthy operation. At the same time as performing the mastectomies, he would remove fat and muscle from my stomach and use this to form new breasts. It was a complicated procedure and there was also a chance that it wouldn’t work. I asked myself, could I cope with having no breasts? I’d deci- ded not to have silicone implants because of recent bad publicity. I concluded that disfigurement was of secondary importance to the certainty of not getting breast cancer. Since 12 years of age I’d been surrounded by this disease and here was a way to get rid of it.\nFrom the time of making my decision in April 1992 I never looked back once. Now I had to decide when to tell people because I’d be in hospital for 2 weeks and off work for a couple of months. I had lunch with a close friend and started to tell her. She was so aghast that I didn’t finish telling her about the reconstruction. I couldn’t wait to get away from her. She just couldn’t hide her feelings. After this I told a few more people but got more or less the same reaction. I was furious and upset. The way I saw it I had made a very difficult decision and these supposed close friends were completely unsympathetic. They made comments like ‘Do you know what you are doing?’ or ‘Why remove your breasts when you haven’t got cancer?’\nI told my doctor friend who had known from the beginning and she said, ‘They’re so busy trying to deal with their own feelings that they can’t focus on you and provide support for you’. I realized just what a threat this seemed to be to other women to have one’s breasts removed. I told my husband I couldn’t tell anyone else so he said to make a list and he would sit down and phone them. I gave him half a dozen names and he did it immediately as I didn’t want these people to find out from others. Needless to say I received a few phone calls from people we’d not told, to say that they’d heard about it; again they were very unsupportive. Despite the lack of help I never faltered.\nThe operation was performed in September 1992. I was really quite ill, which was to be expected. The plastic surgeon was so attentive and kind that somehow, even though I felt very ill, so long as he was looking after me I knew everything would be OK. I was fortunate in that the reconstruction was successful. While lying in hospital I became obsessed with the imminent pathology result of both breasts. ‘What if I’m too late and the cancer was already there?’ Prior to the operation I remember saying to the surgeon, ‘Please cut everything out. I didn’t want any chances taken.’ It took about 10 days for the pathology results and when I was told that everything was OK, I\n...[TRUNCATED]",

But Henry’s symptoms were still not fully explained, and his dementia was now so severe that communication with him was effectively impossible. The family history, however, included members who had manifested jerky movements or dementia late in life. This suggested a possible genetic link. In conversation with a researcher from a project on memory and ageing, the general practitioner involved in Henry’s care learned that a new testing procedure could determine accurately whether Henry might have Huntington’s disease (HD), an incurable progressive disease of the central nervous system. The testing procedure, based on the number of repeats of the gene for HD, would only be available if Henry was enrolled on the research project. (This is no longer the case as far as HD is concerned, but it may well apply for other conditions.) Henry’s clinical team decided to request consent from his family to use the newly available genetic test and to enrol him in the research project. The family agreed, and Henry tested positive for Huntington’s disease 10 days before his death. But it turned out that Henry’s family hadn’t really understood the implications for themselves of allowing him to be tested. Huntington’s is an autosomal dominant condition, meaning that Henry’s children – Ann and Peter would have roughly 50 50 chances of developing the condition themselves. Henry’s wife Mary now wanted everyone in the family to be tested for HD, including her grandchildren (who would have a 1 in 4 chance of developing HD). Ann was willing to be tested herself, but Peter was adamantly against finding out his genetic status or allowing his wife Ruth to learn about Henry’s test results, even though he and his wife already had two young children, and might have more.",

The researchers are particularly interested to\ndiscover whether one variant of a gene called ApoE is\nassociated with migraine.\nMost of the patients at the clinic are young.

Because of this\n’\npotential link, they suggest that they should keep the\ngenetic information they obtain to themselves and\nnot advise the patients and families.\nThey say, rightly, that the implications of having\nthe ApoE allele are not completely clear, and in any\ncase they have neither the time nor the money to\norganize counselling.

The research was conducted\nby researchers funded by the USA, France, Belgium,\nDenmark and South Africa. At that time it was esti-\nmated by the National Institutes of Health that there\nwould soon be 6 million pregnant women in the devel-\n–\noping world infected with HIV. Maternal infant\ntransmission of HIV occurred in approximately 15%\nof cases, with approximately 1000 HIV-positive babies\nborn each day.\nA particular regimen of the antiretroviral drug for\nzidovudine had been shown by research in the USA\nand in France to reduce the risk of such transmission by\nup to 66%. The triple combination regimen, involving\nthree stages (oral doses whilst pregnant, intravenous\ndoses during labour and further oral doses, for the\nchild, up until six weeks after birth), was claimed to\nbe too expensive for widespread use in the developing\nworld [$800 per mother and infant according to\nVarmus and Satcher (1997). This was 600 times the\nannual per capita allocation for healthcare in Malawi].\nff\nWere it possible to develop an e ective regimen of the fi\ndrug which was less expensive than triple combination fi\ntherapy and cheap enough for widespread use in the\ndeveloping world, it would clearly have the potential\nto avoid the infection of a very large number of babies.\nIn order to investigate the success of a lower dosage of\nthe drug, researchers considered two alternative study fi\ndesigns. The rst approach considered was to run a trial\ncomparing a new cheaper regimen with placebo. The\nsecond approach considered was to compare the new\nregimen with triple combination therapy.\nfi\nIt was the rst approach that was adopted in these fi\ntrials. That meant that only half of the HIV-positive\nwomen actually received the drug regime, with the\nother half receiving a placebo. Had the trials been car-\nried out in the developed world, they would have been\nconsidered unethical. The Declaration of Helsinki in its\n‘\nthen-current (1989) version stated that The potential\nfi\nbene ts, hazards and discomfort of a new method\nshould be weighed against the advantages of the best\n’\ncurrent diagnostic and therapeutic methods . However,\ngiven the absence of any such treatment locally, the ‘\nfi\nresearchers felt that the trials were justi ed because,\nwithout them, the women who received the reduced\ndose therapy and those who received the placebo\nwould both have received nothing. The trial, it was\nff\nclaimed, would leave no one worse o than they would\notherwise have been: some women would receive treat-\nment they would not otherwise have had, and those who\nff\nreceived placebos would be no worse o than they\nwould otherwise have been. The researchers also argued\nthat a placebo-controlled trial would produce results\nmore quickly than a treatment-controlled approach.",

After several years of being cared for at\nhome by his wife, Mr AB was nally admitted to a\nspecial care unit in northern Italy because his wife no\nlonger felt able to bear the demands which caring for\nher husband placed upon her.\nOn admission to the unit, a clinical and multidimen-\n’\nsional evaluation of Mr AB s condition revealed him to\nbe severely cognitively impaired and to be extremely\nfrail as a result of malnutrition. Mr AB was capable to\nsome limited extent of walking and also of eating but\nwas dependent upon others in virtually every other\nrespect. Although he was able to walk, Mr AB found\nffi\nbalance very di cult and needed the support of a\ncarer. The doctors who saw him also recorded that he\n‘ ’\nhad severe behaviour disorders associated with\n’\ndementia, such as anxiety and agitation.\nThe physician responsible for Mr AB s care\nfl ’\ndesigned a walking rehabilitation programme for\nhim and the nurses in the unit tried to improve his\nfi nutritional status by means of personal care and\nattention during meal times and by the use of nutri-\ntional supplements. It was also decided to reduce the\nlevels of psychotropic drugs with which Mr AB had\nbeen treated while he was living at home.\nAfter 20 days of treatment at the special care unit,\n’\nMr AB s cognitive and functional status had improved\ndramatically and he was now able to walk alone,\n‘ ’\nwithout help. His behaviour disorders were also less\nsevere and disturbing (especially his anxiety and\nagitation) despite the fact that his treatment with\npsychotropic drugs had been reduced.\nAfter 35 days at the unit, however, Mr AB devel-\noped a fever and cough which became progressively\nworse. This was diagnosed as pneumonia. As a result\nof the pneumonia, Mr AB became much more con-\nfused again and was no longer able to walk. He also\nlost the ability to feed himself. All this resulted in a\n’\ndramatic and serious decline in Mr AB s health. It was\n’\nfelt that Mr AB s life would be at risk unless his pneu-\nmonia was treated and he received some nutrition.\n’\nAfter discussing the patient s condition with\nhis wife, the physician started treating Mr AB intra-\nfl\nvenously with uids and also with antibiotics.\nHowever, during attempts to administer intravenous\ndrugs Mr AB became very irritable and agitated.

The patient was also frail: malnutrition, frequently found in nursing home patients, was the main risk factor for developing pneumonia. However, the patient was not in the end stage of the disease, as was shown by the clinical improvement after rehabilitation. The patient had never written an advance directive about medical treatment before the onset of dementia. So decisions about rehabilitation and the pharmacological treatment of his pneumonia were discussed with his wife, as a substitute decision-maker.\nThe decision to use physical restraint (for a short time only) was taken with the caregiver. Both in the doctor’s and in the caregiver’s view, restraining the patient was judged to be an acceptable process to administer drugs and nourishment. Mr AB’s wife said of the outcome that ensuring his recovery from pneumonia was worthwhile, even if obtained through short-term discomfort. The patient’s reactions against the nurses (agitation and irritability) were interpreted as the effects of dementia, not as an attempt to refuse treatment.\n(Boelli, 1999, personal communication)",

He was removed to a general hospital, where the consultant surgeon diagnosed that he was likely to die imminently if the leg was not amputated below the knee. The prognosis was that he had a 15% chance of survival without amputation. Mr C refused to consider amputation. The hospital authorities considered whether the operation could be performed without Mr C’s consent and made arrangements for a solicitor to see him concerning his competence to give a reasoned decision. In the meantime, treatment with antibiotics and conservative surgery averted the immediate threat of imminent death, but the hospital refused to give an understanding to the solicitor that in recognition of his repeated refusals it would not amputate in any future circumstances. There was a possibility that Mr C would develop gangrene again. An application was made on Mr C’s behalf to the court for an injunction restraining the hospital from carrying out an amputation without his express written consent. On behalf of the hospital it was contended that Mr C’s capacity to give a definitive decision had been impaired by his mental illness and that he had failed to appreciate the risk of death if the operation was not performed. (Re C (Adult: Refusal of Treatment) [1994] 1 All ER 819.)\nNow consider the following additional facts.

        "case": "‘\n’\nThe Case of W\n‘\n’\nW , aged 16, was orphaned at the age of eight, when\nher mother died of cancer. Three years earlier, her\nfather had died of a brain tumour. Together with her\n’\nbrother and sister, W was taken into the care of the\nlocal authority; her aunt, who had been named as\ntestamentary guardian, was unable to care for the\nchildren. After a foster placement broke down, she\nwas moved to a second family, but her new foster\nmother developed breast cancer. Her grandfather, to\nwhom she was very attached, died shortly thereafter,\nwhen W was 13. A few months later W began losing\nff\nweight; she had been su ering from depression and a\nnervous tic for some time before, and she was\nreferred for her eating disorder to the same clinic\nwhich had been treating her other conditions. But\nsessions with a clinical psychologist at the clinic did\nnot really resolve the problems, and shortly before\nher 15th birthday W was admitted on an inpatient\nbasis to a specialist London residential unit for chil-\ndren and adolescents. Here she began injuring herself\nby picking at her skin and other forms of self-harm. A\nfl\nfew months later her condition had deteriorated to\nthe point where she had to be fed by nasogastric\ntube, to which she consented; her arms were encased\nin plaster to prevent her picking at her skin.\nThe local authority decided to move W to another\ntreatment unit, to which W was opposed. She had\nff fi ’\ndeveloped a good relationship with sta at the rst\n–\ncentre, she argued although it was also true that she\nff\nhad occasionally been violent towards sta there.\nHowever, the original treatment centre wanted to\ncontinue working with W and opposed the move.\nHer weight was now stable at about seven stone. In\nMarch 1992 W reached the age of 16 and exercised\nher right to be represented by a solicitor of her own\nchoice. Under the provisions of the Family Law\nReform Act 1969, which treats the treatment choices\n–\nof 16- and 17-year-olds as equally valid to an adult s, it\nappeared that W would have the right to refuse the\ntransfer. The authority made a formal application to\nthe High Court to test whether this was so, requesting\nleave to move W to a named treatment centre with-\nout her consent, and to give her whatever treatment\nthe new centre deemed necessary, also without her\nconsent.\nThe High Court ruled that W was competent, with\nMr Justice Thorpe – also the judge in the C case –\n‘\n’\nstating: There is no doubt at all that [W] is a child of\nffi\nsu cient understanding to make an informed deci-\nsion. This was consistent with the evidence of Dr G, a\nconsultant psychiatrist specializing in anorexia nerv-\n‘\nosa, who noted: I am convinced that she has a good\nintelligence, and understands what is proposed as\n’\ntreatment . It might seem, therefore, that because W\nwas competent, she would be allowed to refuse both\ntransfer to the second centre and the ‘blank cheque’\nwhich the authority was seeking for her treatment\nthere.\nOne could certainly argue that the treatment at\n’\nissue in W s case, the possibility of further arti cial or\nfi\neven forcible feeding, is medical treatment rather than\npsychiatric treatment, and that she should have been\nallowed to refuse it, in the same way that Mr C was\nallowed to refuse amputation. But because there is a\npresumption of incompetence for minors under 18,\nthis was not the case. W had no right to say no, it was\nheld in both the High Court and the Court of Appeal.\nff\nThe e ect of the W case is that young people\nunder 18, even if found competent, are not allowed\nto refuse consent to treatment so long as someone\n’\nwith parental responsibility consents. (In W s case the\nlocal authority had parental responsibility.) The case\n‘\n’\nof W went beyond an earlier judgement, that of R ,\nwhich held that a young person of uctuating mental\ncondition was not competent to refuse treatment (in\n’\nR s case, antipsychotic drugs). W was found compe-\ntent but denied the right to refuse treatment none\nthe less.\nWhereas in the case of Mr C the court was\nimpressed by his dignity of manner and self-control,\nff fi ’\nin W s case her attempts to control her environment,\ncarers and body itself were viewed as pernicious. Lord\nDonaldson called W’s desire for control a ‘pathological\nsymptom of her condition: “One of the symptoms of\nff\nanorexia nervosa is a desire by the su erer to be in\n”\ncontrol , and such a refusal [of treatment] would be\n’\nan obvious way of demonstrating this (Re W, p. 631).\nThis looks particularly odd compared with the C case\n(although the W judgement pre-dates C). It seems\n’\nquite likely that Mr C s refusal was a manifestation of\nhis schizophrenic delusions giving rise to his patho-\nlogical distrust of the clinicians – even if it was also\n’\na desire held by other su erers from vascular disease.\nff\nLord Donaldson argued that W s anorexia under-\n‘\n’\nmined her Gillick competence , the formulation\nlaid down in an earlier case establishing that the\ntest is the ability to understand the nature and pur-\npose of the proposed treatment. The test in the Gillick\n‘ ffi\ncase (1985) was whether the child had su cient\nunderstanding and intelligence to enable him or\nher to understand fully what is proposed’ (Gillick,\np. 423). None the less, Lord Donaldson, in the Court\n’\nof Appeal, declared that this was not enough in\nW s case:\n. . .\nWhat distinguishes W is that it is a feature\nof anorexia nervosa that it is capable of\ndestroying the ability to make an informed\nchoice. It creates a compulsion to refuse treat-\nment or to accept only treatment which is\nff\nlikely to be ine ective. This attitude is part\nand parcel of the disease and the more\nadvanced the illness, the more compelling it\nmay become. Where the wishes of the minor\nare themselves something which the doctors\nreasonably consider to be treated in the\n’\nminor s best interests, those wishes clearly\nfl\nhave a much reduced in uence\n(Re W, p. 637).\nW had broken unit rules at her current treatment\nff\ncentre with impunity, it was noted. A judgement in\nher favour would merely be another form of capit-\nulation, reinforcing her sense that she, not the clini-\ncians, was in control. Throughout the judgement the\n‘\n’\nlanguage of discipline, control and hierarchy is evi-\ndent. Whereas the judge in C seems to regard Mr C\nas his equal, the judgements in W are given from a\npaternalistic position. Thus the W case reinforced\nthe important principle in UK law that children\nand young people are presumed incompetent to\nrefuse treatment, although they may give consent.\nThis is the limit to which their competence can\nextend.\n",

The experience of child abuse\nfrequently leaves individuals with real concerns\nabout the extent to which they are in control\nof their own bodies even if retaining control\nincurs risk.\nA relevant issue is that of Miss A s self con-\n’ cept, i.e. her attitudes of herself towards herself\n(Attanucci, 1988).

        "case": "The case of Mr A\nMr A is a 72-year-old retired railway conductor who lives with his wife in the house of their 43-year-old daughter and her family. Still active on the family smallholding, he is increasingly frustrated by difficulties in operating machinery and in finding his way about the house. Accompanied by his wife and daughter, he visited Dr B’s clinic for memory disturbance, where he was diagnosed with hypertension, arteriosclerotic occlusive disease, and multiple subcortical perivascular lesions on a computer scan of his brain. The overall diagnosis was subcortical vascular dementia with a moderate degree of impairment. It emerged that Mr A also had considerable impairment of his short-term memory (e.g. telephone numbers) and long-term recall (e.g. names of old friends). However, he denied strenuously that his mental powers were in any way impaired.\nIn the course of the consultation, Dr B asked Mr A whether he drove a car. Mr A replied that he did, and Dr B warned him that he should stop, from a medical point of view – because of his memory impairment.\nMr A absolutely refused to consider stopping: he was in perfectly good health, he insisted, and still very fit.\n'I’m a lot better driver than all those young lunatics!'\nMr A’s daughter interrupted at this point to describe two small car accidents which her father had recently caused. Mr A then announced, out of the blue, that he had just decided to buy a new car. If there was any problem, it lay in the old car, not in his driving.\nAnd there the matter rested, at least in the doctor’s consultation.\nPrivately Mr A’s wife and daughter agreed between themselves that the only possible solution was to hide the car keys. But Mr A managed to locate them, and drove off to a reunion of his railway colleagues without any incident. When he returned, it was with a new copy of the car keys, and a bad mood that lasted for days at home. Mr A’s wife has now lost any will to prevent her husband from driving: she can’t bear his anger, she says, and in any case he was perfectly all right last time he drove. Perhaps he doesn’t have dementia after all, she remarked to the doctor on her own next visit to his surgery.\n(Hope, 1997)",

They sit holding\nhands, they irt with each other and talk or cuddle\nfor most of the time.\nHowever, despite the genuine happiness both\nLisa and Martin experience the sta at the home are\nconcerned about their relationship. It is apparent\nthat Lisa falsely believes that Martin is her husband\nand that Martin, also falsely, believes that Lisa is his\nwife.\nThis poses several problems for the sta . On the\none hand there is the ethical question raised earlier in\nthe rst section of this chapter of whether they ought\nto adopt a reality orientation approach or one based\non validation. That is, should they encourage the two\nresidents to confront the truth about their relation-\nship or should they respect and validate their feelings\nand the meaning the relationship has for them? On\nthe other hand, in the case of Lisa and Martin there is\na much more pressing ethical dilemma for the sta .\nFor whilst Lisa s husband is in fact deceased, Martin s\nwife is not and comes to visit him on average once a\nweek. This causes practical as well as ethical problems\nfor the sta .\nWhen Martin s wife visits him he sometimes\nrecognizes her, but sometimes he does not. This natu-\nrally upsets his wife. Martin s wife does not appear to\nknow about the relationship between Martin and\nLisa. When she comes to visit, the sta who work in\nthe home try to make sure that Lisa is out or engaged\nin some activity in another room in order to avoid a\nconfrontation. The problem with this is that Martin\nand Lisa desperately want to be together and protest\nwhen they are separated.\nThe sta do not know what to do. This is not, they\nfeel, simply a matter of whether or not they should\nkeep Martin s wife in the dark; it a ects every aspect\nof managing the home. At bed time, for example,\nMartin and Lisa want to sleep together. They have\nsaid this when their respective children have been to\nvisit them and the children have told the sta that\nsuch behaviour cannot be allowed.\nThus far, the sta who work in the home have\nrespected the wishes of the children and have sepa-\nrated Martin and Lisa at bed times despite loud prot-\nest s. The sta nd this very upsetting when they see\njust how unhappy Lisa and Martin are but nd it very\ndi cult to know what they ought to do.",

The transition\nffi\nfrom junior to senior school was a di cult one for\nSean. In the senior school he associated with the boys\nff\nin his class who smoked and took time o school. He\nfelt that one teacher in particular was against him,\nbecause he constantly reprimanded and punished\nSean for being cheeky. Two years ago there was a\ndisagreement between Sean and the teacher during\nwhich Sean hit the teacher.

He had devel- \noped extensive varices of the oesophagus which \nbrought with them an accompanying risk of serious \nbleeding which would put the boy’s life in danger. \nWhen the doctor informed the family that the \nseriousness of the boy’s condition might require a \nblood transfusion in order to save his life, both the \nboy and his family refused to consider such an option \nbecause of their faith.

        "case": "The case of Pekka \nThe Finnish Act on the Status and Rights of Patients \n(enforced in 1993) offers a minor who is mature and \ncapable enough the chance to make decisions about \nhis or her own treatment, but in practice parents \nmake decisions for children under 12. According to \nFinnish mental health legislation, at 12 a child can \nhimself appeal against a compulsory treatment deci- \nsion to an administrative court; the parents also have \na parallel right to make a complaint. A child is an \nindependent subject in his or her own right; the \nchild’s interests can be separate from and even con- \ntrary to the interests of his or her parents. For exam- \nple, Section 7 of the Finnish Act on the Status and \nRights of Patients states that, \n‘The opinion of a minor patient on a treatment \nmeasure has to be assessed with regard to his/her \nage or level of development. . . . If a minor patient \ncan decide on the treatment given to him/her, he/she \nhas to be cared for in mutual understanding with \nhim/her.’ \nThis strong line on children’s autonomy goes \nbeyond law and practice in other Nordic nations, \nsuch as Sweden. However, while a child is said to be \na subject in his or her own right, children usually lack \nresources and means to put their own rights into \npractice. \nDespite this strong ‘child’s voice’ stance, a 1995 \ncase illustrated that these legal criteria are sometimes \nflouted. A boy of 11 – call him Pekka – was treated \nunder a compulsory psychiatric order for ten months, \nagainst his and his mother’s wishes. She managed to \narrange his escape from the institution where he was \nbeing treated and sent him to live secretly with rela- \ntives in Estonia. He only returned after his 12th birth- \nday, when by law his own opinions had to be heard. \nEven more important than the legal position, how- \never, were institutional rules. The psychiatric hospital \nwhere the boy had originally been treated did not \ntake children of 12 and over. The institution for young \npeople over 12 diagnosed the boy as normal; he \nsubsequently lived with his mother and attended a \nnormal school.",

        "case": "Case study: the Montjoie affair\nUntil the early 1980s most professionals working with abused children in France would invoke the ‘Law of Silence’. In this era of silence abuses of discretion abounded. It was difficult to evaluate the number of ill-treated children, or even of fatal cases of abuse. The percentage of abuse cases reported to the judicial authorities was very low. Yet the law did make it plain that doctors were to be released from their normal professional duty of confidentiality when, in the course of their work, they came to know of abuse and neglect of children under the age of 15.\nIn the early 1980s, however, a public campaign was organized around the slogan, ‘50 000 children are abused every year; speaking out is the first step’. Interministerial circulars of 1983 and 1985 informed practitioners of their responsibilities and specified procedures for hospital admission in cases of suspected abuse. This was followed up by legislation on the prevention of child abuse, in May 1989.\nBut difficulties about confidentiality remained. There was a basic discrepancy between an article of the criminal code which respected professional confidentiality and another article which allowed the criminal prosecution of anyone who ‘having knowledge about abuse of a child under the age of 15, does not report the case to the administrative or judicial authorities’. While it was clear that the doctor may report the case of an abused child without fear of criminal proceedings for breach of confidentiality, it was less clear whether he or she had an active responsibility to report cases of abuse encountered in the line of professional practice. Doctors were free to report abuse, but were they obliged to do so?\nIn December 1992 these dilemmas came to a head in the ‘Montjoie affair’. Damien, aged seven, and Mickael, aged 18, had been placed together in a foster family, but Damien’s foster parents informed Mickael’s educational psychologist that Damien had complained of being abused by Mickael. The psychiatrist on the team, Dr Bernard Chouraqui, was informed two days later that the psychologist wished to separate the two boys immediately, sending Mickael to another foster family. After discussion the team decided to wait 10 days before informing the judicial authorities so as to allow constructive therapy for Mickael, who was thought to be on the verge of a breakdown, which would be worsened by the threat of prosecution. The clinical team felt that he needed to be prepared to face the judicial consequences of his act.\nThe juvenile court was duly informed two weeks after the abuse had first been reported. In January 1993 the investigating judge charged the educational psychologist and the social worker on the team with ‘not having reported the abuse’. On the same day the psychiatrist, Dr Chouraqui, appeared before the juvenile court of his own free will to explain the situation. He was immediately charged with the same offence and imprisoned, together with the educational psychologist. Dr Chouraqui was not released to await trial for another two weeks; at his trial 10 months later, however, he was acquitted.",

In that case, Victoria Gillick unsuccessfully argued that parents should have to provide consent before a young person could be prescribed the contraceptive pill.

The girls\nmothers were opposed to vaccination because they\nfelt that it posed unacceptable risks – indeed, there\nhad, at the time, been much media coverage of\nresearch which suggested an association between\nreceiving the vaccine and developing autism and\nbowel problems (Wake eld et al., 1998).\n’\nThe girls fathers were, however, in favour of them\nbeing immunized, because they felt that this was in\n’\nthe children s best interests.

He did recognize that the mothers (and their\ndaughters) were owed the right to respect for their\nprivate and family life, but he further noted how these\nfi\nrights were quali ed by the need to protect the\nhealth of the children.

However, the appeal judges\nconceded that Mr Justice Sumner had been particu-\nlarly thorough in his consideration of the medical\nevidence, but they felt that this was entirely appro-\npriate given the crucial importance of this evidence.\nLike the trial judge before them, the appeal judges\nfelt that the balance tipped considerably in favour of\nthe combined MMR vaccination and away from the\n’\nunreliable evidence presented by the mothers legal\nteam which was, said Lord Justice Sedley, ‘junk\n’\nscience .",

(His mother had previously died of the disease.) Bone was taken from his right fibula in an attempt to strengthen the left tibia, but after 15 months in plaster, his lower left leg had to be amputated. His right leg was weakened by the surgery, and he then underwent two attempts at osteostomy to treat a valgus right foot (one that rolls over). Now he is undergoing limb lengthening of the right fibula. As he describes it, ‘I’m going to have a bone graft in my right leg. Take a little bit from here (he touches his hip) and put it here (he touches his ankle) to fix it. And get a pin, just put it in and stitch it, then they wait till they heal it.’ He smiles and jokes about the forthcoming procedure: ‘Then I’ll get a wheelchair – be lazy all the time, I like that, better than crutches.’\nDanny’s parents are less sanguine: they have just learned that another large tumour has to be removed from his left leg stump. They feel that they have little choice but to consent to a further amputation if that proves necessary during the additional surgery, which will be done at the same time as the limb lengthening. They have not told Danny that his entire leg may have to be amputated. He knows about the new tumour, and has said ‘I don’t mind them taking the tumour, but I don’t want them taking any more of my leg away’. Danny’s father says, ‘You feel that everyone is doing what they believe to be in his best interest, but they are tending to work a little bit blind’.\nACTIVITY: Stop at this point in the story and complete your checklist in relation to the limb lengthening of Danny’s right fibula and possible left leg amputation. Has a meaningful consent been obtained? Has the child’s voice been heard? What about the parents’ position?\nIn the event it proved possible to save the remaining left leg, and the right leg grew well, although Danny suffered a great deal of pain from the limb lengthening procedure. Now the surgeons want to lengthen the small stump below Danny’s left knee. Danny’s stepmother explained to the boy that this will give greater leverage to the prosthesis, but Danny said adamantly, ‘I don’t want them doing that!’. He would not explain why; he looked tired and depressed now, with dark circles under his eyes and little of his former chirpy manner. The surgeon gave the family three months to think about it, though he hinted that ‘It would be interesting to see how the leg responds’. Danny’s stepmother was sceptical about the surgeon’s motive: ‘Is he really thinking about what’s for Danny’s benefit, or is he just curious?’ Danny’s father replied, ‘He genuinely felt that there was some advantage to Danny’. But Danny’s stepmother argued, ‘He’s going to senior school soon, he doesn’t want another six months in a wheelchair’.\nIn the end, the family refused consent for lengthening the left leg stump.",

His clinicians\nalso diagnosed brain damage following seizures, an\nintestinal blockage, and renal failure which meant\nthat his kidneys failed to clear toxins, although they\nproduced urine. Initially, Ryan was sustained through\nintravenous feeding and dialysis, but his clinicians\ndoubted that he could be kept alive in this fashion\nuntil he was old enough for a kidney transplant, at\nabout 2 years. They wanted to end treatment on the\ngrounds of futility: it was argued that long-term dial-\nysis would not only be inappropriate but would be\n’\nimmoral , since it would prolong Ryan s su ering with\nno chance of improvement.\n’\nRyan s parents refused to accept withdrawal of\n’\ntreatment, despite the hospital s view that imposing\n‘ ’\nvirtually futile treatment would be inhumane. The\nNguyens sought a second opinion from a neonatolo-\ngist at another hospital, but that, too, was unfavour-\nable. Finally, they obtained an emergency court order,\npermitted under the legislation of their home state,\ndirecting the hospital to take whatever steps were\n’\nnecessary to maintain Ryan s life, including dialysis.\nThe publicity surrounding the case attracted another\n’\nhospital s attention, and this third hospital accepted\nRyan for transfer. Three days later, surgeons there\noperated to clear Ryan s blocked intestines. He was\nshortly able to take nutrition by mouth, and at 3\nmonths he was sent home, not having needed any\nfurther dialysis. At 1 year he appeared to be develop-\nfi\ning normally for his age, free of any permanent neuro-\nlogical de cit; his most recent CAT scan shows no\nstructural problems.",

        "case": "The Case of Child B\nChild B (later publicly identi ed as Jaymee Bowen), aged 10, was acutely ill with leukaemia (R v Cambridge Health Authority, ex p. B [1995] 1 FLR 1055). A bone-marrow transplant had proved unsuccessful. Now both her own doctor and oncologists from London’s Royal Marsden Hospital believed she had only a few weeks to live, with further treatment being futile. Although Jaymee’s own views in favour of treatment were of uncertain validity – she had not been told how ill she was – her father refused to accept this decision. He located a professor at the Hammersmith Hospital who recommended a further course of chemotherapy followed by an experimental second bone-marrow transplant, which would have to be provided by Jaymee’s younger sister. Primarily because the professor had acknowledged that this was experimental, non-standard therapy, and secondarily because Department of Health guidance limited the funding of unproven treatment, Jaymee’s Health Authority in Cambridge decided that the substantial expenditure on treatment with such a small prospect of success would not be an e ective use of resources (Herring, 2008, p. 57).\nMr Bowen brought a legal action to compel the Health Authority to fund Jaymee’s treatment with the experimental procedure. His chances of success looked poor, despite a massive outpouring of public sympathy and extensive media coverage. Normally, English courts are reluctant to intervene in such mat-ters unless it can be shown that the decision was taken in bad faith or was patently unreasonable. Although in a 1987 case (R. v. Secretary of State for Social Services, ex parte Walker) the Court of Appeal had stated that courts could strike down decisions about resource allocation, no court had actually done so.\nNevertheless Mr Bowen succeeded, at least at rst. In the High Court the Health Authority’s decision was quashed, and their powers to refuse treatment on grounds of resource shortage were severely limited. The Health Authority was ordered to reconsider its decision and to spell out its reasoning more clearly, allowing the father a chance to show that the decision had, in fact, been unreasonable. The burden was put on the Health Authority: its duty to recognize Jaymee’s fundamental right to life required it to show compelling reasons why other patients should implic-itly have priority over her.\nHowever, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision. Whether or not a treatment was life-saving, the Appeal Court held, had no bearing on the general principle that courts could not intervene to determine the merits of the dispute. Courts should not be drawn into resource allocation decisions. Nor should the Health Authority be forced to show where it planned to spend the money that would notionally be saved by not treating Jaymee. The Appeal Court’s reasoning was based not primarily on resource shortage, however, but on the weight of medical evidence, suggesting that it was not in Jaymee’s best interests to undergo the experimental procedure. So e cacy of treatment clearly is a proper legal consideration.\nIn the end, a private benefactor came forward, o ering to fund Jaymee’s experimental treatment. She appeared at rst to be doing well after the pro-cedure, but worsened after a few months and died. After her death, Mr Bowen reiterated his satisfaction that everything possible had been done, despite the tragic outcome.",

He was advised to\nhave surgery but chose not to, as he explained in his\nbook In the Face of Death:\nSurvival chances in bladder cancer are rela-\ntively good, especially if the surgery is com-\nbined with radiation treatment. How\nfavourable the odds were was a matter of\n–\nstatistics about 50%. In response to my\nquestions, [the urologist] says that sexual\nintercourse would no longer be possible\nsince there could be no erection; but there\n–\nwas no other essential limitation biking,\nsports in moderate measure, even skiing.\nPatients who survived the critical first five\nyears all grew accustomed to the curtailed\nlife. When I explained that I would never con-\nsent to such an operation under any condi-\ntions, he said that he had great respect for\nsuch a decision but that I should really get as\nmuch information as possible from other doc-\ntors as well. Did I want to take the X-rays with\nme? I said no; the case seemed quite clear to\nme.\nWhat bothers me is the loss of freedom;\nhaving others in charge of you, to be drawn\ninto a medical machine which controls a per-\nson and which one cannot fight. Naturally\nintolerable pain will disturb me too. In order\nto escape it, one enters the machine that\ntakes away pain and at the same time free-\ndom. And it s precisely this enslavement that I\ndon t want.\nI don t want to get sucked into the\nsurgical-urological-radiological machinery\nbecause I would lose my liberty bit by bit.\nWith hopes getting more and more\nreduced my will would be broken and in\nthe end I will end up in the well-known\ndying chamber, [to] which everybody\n–\ntends to give a wide berth the outer\noffice of the cemetery.\nPeter Noll died nearly a year after his diagnosis, dur-\ning which he had lived alone and administered his\nown pain relief. However he had continued to write,\nto work and to meet his friends until the last few days\nof his life.\nAs a part of his preparation for death Peter Noll\nplanned his own funeral.\n\n\nThe case of Peter Noll (continued)\nPeter Noll s friends varied in their responses to his\ndecision to refuse treatment. He wrote,\nThe expression of respect seems, to a certain\nextent, to be a standard response, for I heard\nit several times afterward. Naturally, it is\nappropriate to show a patient who chooses\nmetastasis [the spread of the original cancer\nto other organs] instead of the technological\nprolongation of death a certain admiration,\neven though, strictly speaking, he hardly\ndeserves it, for he really has only a choice\nbetween two evils, and it is almost purely a\nquestion of taste as to which he prefers.\nBut his friend Ruth informed him that\nhis decision was difficult to accept for several\nof his friends.\nYou see, you re upsetting people with\nyour decision. If someone has cancer, he goes\nto hospital and has surgery that s what s\nnormal. But if someone has cancer and goes\naround cheerfully like you, it gives people the\ncreeps. They are all of a sudden challenged to\nconfront dying and death as a part of life, and\nthat they don t want. Nor are they able to do it\nas long as they are not in your situation. That\nis why it is irritating and confusing that you sit\nhere and say I have cancer while refusing to\ngo to the hospital. If you went to the hospital\neverything would be all right. Then every-\nthing would be fine again; people could visit\nyou, bring flowers, and after a certain time\nsay, Thank God, he s been released and\nagain after a certain time, Now he s back in ,\nand they ll come again with flowers, but\nalways for shorter periods. But at least they\nwould know where to find you. They would\nknow that you hadn't been run over by a car\nbut have cancer and that you were going to\nthe hospital to have things cut out, all as it is\nsupposed to be. You scandalise them (this\n–\nisn t the way she expressed it) you are show-\ning them that death is in our midst and you\nare acting it out before their very eyes; they\nsuddenly are forced to think of what they\nhave always suppressed. And of course they\nthink only of themselves. Which makes it all\nthe worse. They cannot help imagining what\ntheir own fate will be at some future time.",

Consider this entry in his diary after he learned the diagnosis of bladder cancer:\nWhat bothers me is the loss of freedom: having others in charge of you, to be drawn into a medical machine which controls a person and which one cannot fight. Naturally, intolerable pain will disturb me too. In order to escape it, one enters the machine that takes away pain and at the same time freedom. And it’s precisely the enslavement that I don’t want.\nWe think it probably does: what Peter Noll most feared was that the narrative of his life (and death) would be written not by himself but by what he called the ‘medical machine’. Once he consented to the surgery and radiation for his bladder cancer, he felt, the script would be out of his authorship: things would take their own course, and he would be sucked into one procedure after another.\nThe notion of exercising autonomy as writing one’s own script also entails possible conflict with the approved roles, the conventional script; you may recall that Peter Noll’s friend Ruth pointed out to him that ‘some of those close to him found it irritating and confusing that you sit here and say “I have cancer” while refusing to go to hospital’. By exercising his autonomy in the sense of refusing to read from the socially acceptable script for cancer sufferers, but insisting instead on writing his own narrative, Noll placed himself outside the bounds: people no longer knew where to locate him in the usual story – not just literally.",

She is spending six hours, three times a week on a dialysis machine and the effects of this are becoming increasingly hard for her and her family to bear. She has already had one kidney transplant, which her body rejected, and her doctors are unsure whether a second would work but are willing to try if they can find a suitable donor. After some tests the paediatrician privately tells the father that he is compatible and therefore a suitable donor.\nIt may seem inconceivable that a father would refuse to donate his kidney to his daughter under such circumstances. Yet he does refuse and justifies his decision both on the grounds that the success of the transplant is uncertain and also on the basis of his concerns about the implications of the operation itself for him and his family. He is frightened and worried about what would happen to him and his other children if his remaining kidney were to fail. But he is ashamed to feel this way and cannot bear to refuse openly so he asks the paediatrician to tell the family that he is in fact not compatible. However, whilst having some sympathy, she says she cannot lie for him and, after a silence, the father says, ‘OK then I’ll do it. If they knew that I was compatible but wouldn’t donate my kidney, it would wreck the family’.",

His wife Susan comes to visit him every day, bringing a home-cooked evening meal. The nursing home s guidelines for good practice encourage relatives involvement, and Mr P does seem pleased to see Susan when she rst arrives.

This seems to make Mr P very agitated, and he is often hard to calm after Susan s visits. The nursing home sta have asked Susan not to feed Mr P, but this has led to worsening relations. They feel that Mr P is clearly indicating that he does not want to be forcibly fed. Susan, very hurt by this comment, insists that she is handling Mr P in a playful but caring fashion, and that she has to do something about Mr P s weight loss, which she blames on inadequate nutrition in the home. 'If you can t even feed him properly, what else are you doing wrong? He s not getting any better, you know.' The nursing sta themselves are divided, some feeling that Susan is trying to help, and others that she is in denial about her husband s impending death. The doctors at the nursing home, however, are unanimous. They see no reason to allow Susan to continue feeding Mr P, as it is contrary to his medical best interests and indeed risks asphyxiation. The manager of the home agrees with the doctors: this unnecessary trouble is upsetting the smooth running of the home, and should be stopped.",

In addition, in a private meeting with the medical director, you have been told that the expenditures per patient load of care of each of the physicians would be examined yearly to determine which physician would be promoted.\nWhat do you do?\na. Fully inform the patient about the risks and benefits of bone marrow transplantation.\nb. Refer your patient to an oncologist to have this discussion.\nc. Transfer the patient to another primary-care provider.\nd. Advise the patient to fde suit against the managed care plan.\ne. Inform the patient about bone marrow transplantation if he asks you about it.",

She had been told by\nher radiologist that the calcifications could be a sign of ductal carcinoma\nin situ (DCIS). It was still a shock to hear that the changes in the mammog-\nraphy films required more diagnostic tests; a breast biopsy was needed to\nascertain the actual pathology.\nThe results from the core needle biopsy showed that the lesion was\ninvasive cancer. There was no palpable mass in the breast, but only further\noperation would determine the size of the tumor and whether it had in-\nvaded the lymph nodes. In a whirlwind of appointments, Ms. Bachman met\nwith a surgeon to learn about what options were available. If no lymph\nnodes are involved, breast conservation therapy (BCT), also called lumpec-\ntomy, was one option, as was a simple mastectomy (excision of the breast,\nnipple, areola, and most of the overlying skin). Ms. Bachman also met with\nan oncologist who said that further treatment decisions would be based\non the stage of the disease and her age. For example, if the tumor was\nsmall, from 2 to 5 cm, and had invaded the lymph nodes, then she would be\na candidate for chemotherapy. Moreover, whether the tumor was estrogen-\nreceptor positive or negative played a significant role in how aggressive\ntreatment should be.\nDepending on how many lymph nodes were involved, the oncologist\nmight recommend radiation therapy, noting that some studies suggested\nthat postmastectomy radiation therapy was indicated even for patients\nwith Tl-2 (tumor of 1-2 cm) breast cancer with 0-3 positive nodes. The\nchemotherapy had significant side effects such as nausea, vomiting, fa-\ntigue, cognitive changes, alopecia, insomnia, and constipation. Another\nserious side effect was ovarian toxicity. Since Ms. Bachman was 87 years\nold and premenopausal, this was of concern to her. It was likely that chemo-\ntherapy would result in amenorrhea and premature menopause. The sur-\ngeon and oncologist stated that if the cancer was in an early stage, they\nwould recommend BCT and aggressive chemotherapy and radiation for\nthe best survival outcomes. Ms. Bachman knew, from looking at reputable\nsites on the Internet, that there was controversy over what was the best\ncourse of action. She felt pressured by the surgeon to choose BCT even\nthough she thought she would feel safer with a more radical removal of\nbreast tissue, but she was not sure. She had so little time to weigh the bene-\nfits and risks of all the different treatment options that were presented to\nher, she felt overwhelmed.",

He also had a genetic condition known as Down syndrome. The Down\nsyndrome would leave the boy with some undetermined level of mental —\nretardation even if his anatomical problems were corrected, but, according\nto published reports, the child would have a high probability of surviving,\nalbeit with the Down syndrome, if his only medical problems were the sur-\ngically correctable fistula and atresia.\nThe attending obstetrician, Walter Owens, informed the parents that,\neven with the operation, the child would still not be normal. He would\n“have all the problems that even the best of them have.” He added that\n“some of these children ... are mere blobs” (cited in U.S. Commission on\nCivil Rights, p. 22).\nOn the basis of this information, the parents decided not to permit op-\neration to correct the fistula. The parents were trained as teachers and had\nexperience teaching handicapped and retarded children. They had two\nother children without Down syndrome.\nSome reports indicated that the baby also had a cardiac septal defect,\na serious malformation of the heart that would require operative repair.\nThat possibility might explain why some claims were made that the child\nhad only a 50-50 chance of survival even with operation.°®\nWhen nurses protested the decision of the parents not to treat, the hospi-\ntal sought judicial intervention. In the lower court, Judge John G. Baker\nsupported the parental decision, finding that the parents, after being fully\ninformed, “have the right to choose a medically recommended course of\ntreatment for their child in the present circumstances.” The Indiana Supreme\nCourt refused to get involved, thus upholding the lower court's decision.\nThose opposing the parents sought appeal to U.S. Supreme Court, but\nthat appeal was made moot by death of the baby on April 15. Two weeks\nlater, President Reagan asked the Attorney General and Secretary of\nHealth and Human Services (HHS) to become involved, noting that federal\nlaw prohibits discrimination against the handicapped. This led to the issu-\ning of a notice that it was illegal to discriminate against infants solely on\nthe basis of handicap. While this notice was rejected by the courts, eventu-\nally a law was passed classifying withholding of life support in cases such\nas this as child abuse.”",

He had beaten her over the head with a hammer and stabbed her in\nthe chest with a knife. He conspired in the murder with his cousin, Rick\nOrtega, who had been in a homosexual relationship with another man who\nwas concurrently dating Winchell. Ortega’s jealousy was purportedly the\nmotive for the attack on Winchell.\nFor twenty-five years the conviction proceeded through the California\ncourts until the much-postponed execution day of February 21, 2006, arrived.\nMr. Morales was scheduled to be executed at 12:01 a.m. at San Quentin. U.S.\nDistrict Judge Jeremy Fogel had ordered that, in order to avoid cruelty if the\ndrugs to be used in the execution did not do their job properly, the prison\nhad to have a medical professional present in the death chamber. Two anes-\nthesiologists, whose identity has never been made public, were engaged\nfor this purpose, but, under pressure from medical professional organiza-\ntions, they withdrew two hours before the scheduled execution. The execution\nwas indefinitely postponed. Morales expressed relief. Terri Winchell’s mother\ndescribed the news as “a blow in the stomach.”\nThose critical of the participation of the physicians in the execution cite\nthe AMA's Code of Medical Ethics, which states, “A physician, as a member\nof a profession dedicated to preserving life when there is hope of doing so,\nshould not be a participant in a legally authorized execution.”\nAccording\nto the AMA, this precludes selecting injection sites, starting IV lines, and\nprescribing, preparing, administering, or supervising injection of lethal\ndrugs. For the AMA, this does not extend to testifying about medical history,\ndiagnosis, or mental state; certifying death; witnessing an execution in a\ntotally nonmedical capacity; or relieving the acute suffering of a condemned\nprisoner awaiting execution.\nDefenders of physician participation claim that physicians, as licensed\nmedical professionals, should be involved in order to assure that the state's\ncommitment to avoiding unnecessarily cruel punishment is satisfied.\nIn California, following the postponement of the execution, competing\nbills were introduced into the legisiature by physicians who were members of\nthe California legislature. Senator Sam Aenestad, a general anesthesiologist,\nintroduced legislation to protect physicians who participate in executions\nfrom punishment or professional discipline. Meanwhile, Assemblymen Alan\nNakanishi, an eye surgeon, and a colleague introduced a bill sponsored by\nthe California Medical Association prohibiting physician participation. At\nissue is not only the general ethics of capital punishment but also the ques-\ntion of whether participation of physicians is compatible with their role as\nhealers.",

Case 3-4\nThe Eager Research Subject: Justifying External Moral Standards\nDr. Laura Bollinger was a 62-year-old former college professor of biology\nwho had taken early retirement when she developed macular degeneration\nthat produced blindness. Over the years in which her sight was deteriorat-\ning, she began researching the causes and potential therapies for blind-\nness. She had been a patient in the National Institutes of Health's (NIH)\nAge-Related Eye Disease Study and had developed a friendship with NIH\nscientists at the National Eye Institute. In particular, she came to know and\nbecame friends with Dr. Anton Hakola, one of the leading researchers in\nthe vision restoration lab.\nFrom that friendship, she learned of some avant-garde research that\nwas arousing the interest of the research ophthalmology community. With\nthe development of microcircuity electronics, some scientists believed that\neventually the technology would be developed that could produce an artifi-\ncial eye. In effect, it would be a miniature camera that converted images into\nelectrical impulses that could be fed directly into the occipital lobe of the\nbrain, thus bypassing a damaged eye. At the point Dr. Bollinger heard about\nthese ideas, the research was in its earliest stages. Very few animal studies\nhad been completed. She knew that eventually researchers would want to\nattempt the development of this technology in humans, who could give much\nmore precise feedback on the placing of the electrodes into the brain.\nAfter extensive research on the safety and potential effectiveness of\nthis line of research, Dr. Bollinger gradually came to the conclusion that\nshe would be the ideal research subject. She was blind, had a deep interest\nin developing such technology, and had the scientific capacity to under-\nstand the risks and to cooperate with the investigators. She also had large\namounts of time available. She offered her services to Dr. Hakola.\nHesitant at first, he came to believe that Dr. Bollinger understood ex-\nactly what she was doing and could, in fact, be a significant contributor to\nthe research. She understood that the research would involve cutting a\nhalf-dollar-sized hole in her skull, through which researchers could pass\nelectrodes. Similar work had been done over the years to map the location\nof motor and sensory areas of the brain, but these experiments were often\ndone on patients who needed to have their skulls opened for some thera-\npeutic purpose. This project would involve a much larger hole, and it would\nbe undertaken solely for research purposes.\nA protocol was developed and presented to an institutional review\nboard (IRB), a hospital board responsible for reviewing research to assure\nthat subjects are protected. Several members of that board questioned the\nresearch on the grounds that it posed risks that were too great and that the\nresearch must first be developed in lower animal species before being\ntried in humans. After extensive debate, the IRB refused to approve the pro-\nposal until further animal studies were completed. These could take two to\nthree years.\nDr. Bollinger was disturbed, indeed annoyed, at the IRB decision. She\nunderstood that she was very unlikely to benefit from the study. Surely the\nfirst results would produce nothing more than a crude visual image of light\nand dark patterns, and that could take many years. She was unlikely to live\nlong enough for the technology to be perfected. On the other hand, she felt\na close identification with the community of the visually impaired and felt\nshe had a moral right to make her unique contribution, as long as scientists\nwere willing to accept her as a research subject. She was willing to sign\nany legal release from liability that seemed necessary. If Dr. Bollinger and\nDr. Hakola both find this research at this time to be moral and the informed\nconsent is impeccable, are there moral standards to which the IRB can\nappeal that would justify delaying the research?",

She was being seen in the prenatal clinic at the\ncommunity's only tertiary care Catholic hospital because she had a history\nof three previous episodes of ruptured uterus that had resulted in the\ndeaths of her previous fetuses. She was currently in her twentieth week of\npregnancy. She was a member of a local Baptist church.\nDr. Lakisha Nevitt, her attending physician, was very concerned be-\ncause ultrasound revealed that a portion of Ms. Jones's uterine wall was no\nmore than a millimeter in thickness. She was convinced it would soon rup-\nture, ending the life of the fetus and posing a serious risk to Ms. Jones's life.\nIt was her opinion that, with virtual certainty, the uterus would rupture\nbefore the fetus could reach full term.\nDr. Nevitt knew that, since the hospital had a Roman Catholic affilia-\ntion, abortion could not be performed there. Even though Dr. Nevitt was\nherself not Catholic, she accepted this stance when she went to work at this\nhospital. Even if an exception could be made in this case to preserve the\nlife of the mother, no one in the hospital's obstetrics department had enough\nexperience with abortion to perform one safely. The real issue was whether\nthey should advise Ms. Jones of the seriousness of her situation and recom-\nmend that she be transferred to City Hospital, which was only a mile away\nand had a staff with considerable experience with abortion.\nDr. Nevitt asked for a hospital ethics committee meeting to try to sort\nout the options. There was a quick consensus among the medical people on\nthe committee that this was a life-threatening situation and that Ms. Jones's\nuterus would almost certainly rupture well before a full-term birth. The\nethics committee included two Catholic chaplains, both of whom empha-\nsized that since they were in a Catholic institution, they must begin with\nthe presumption that all life, including fetal life, is sacred and cannot be\nintentionally terminated. The Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic\nHealth Care Services was cited, which states categorically, “Abortion (that\nis, the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the\ndirectly intended destruction of a viable fetus) is never permitted.”\nOne of the committee members raised the question of whether an ex-\nception can be made for preserving the life of the mother. He pointed out\nthat it seems tragic to condone the death of both mother and fetus when at\nleast the mother could be saved. Since this was an extremely rare case\nwhere there was virtual certainty that the mother could not survive the rup-\nture and that, if this occurred, the fetus would die as well, he urged making\nan exception by informing the woman that their committee recommend\nthat she be transferred to a secular hospital such as City Hospital.\nOne of the chaplains responded, pointing out that the prohibition was\nexceptionless. The only possibility would be to interpret the intervention as\nan “indirect” killing of the fetus, which would be acceptable for proportion-\nally good reasons. This, he indicated, was the reasoning used in cases in\nwhich a pregnant woman has cancer of the uterus. In such cases a hyster-\nectomy is permitted to remove the cancer even though the fetus would die\nin the process. He suggested that perhaps a hysterectomy could be accept-\nable in this case as well since the weakness in the uterine wall would pose\na threat to the woman not only in this pregnancy but in any future pregnan-\ncies as well. He acknowledged that this reasoning was controversial but\nthought it would justify a recommendation from the committee that the pa-\ntient be directed to the City Hospital. He noted that legally the hospital was\nnot required to have staff to perform abortions, but that they were required\nto inform the patient of treatment options—including transferring to an-\nother hospital that would offer abortion services.\nThe committee members recognized that, if this case had arisen in any\nother hospital without an institutional commitment opposing all direct\nabortions, a recommendation for terminating this pregnancy would be\nreached by easy consensus.\nThe dilemma here is how the moral stance of the sponsors of the hospi-\ntal should shape the way medicine is practiced in this institution.",

Though\nthis particular type of leukemia is somewhat less responsive to chemo-\ntherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh responded well to a course of chemotherapy\nthat he took orally shortly after his diagnosis. Dr. Cavanaugh’s last blood\ncount indicated that his white blood count was greatly reduced. During\nthe course of his chemotherapy, Dr. Cavanaugh had become close to\nHeather Eyberg, Pharm.D., the clinical pharmacist in the cancer treat-\nment center.\nAfter a follow-up visit with the oncologist, Dr. Cavanaugh stopped by\nDr. Eyberg’s office. Dr. Cavanaugh said, “The doctor has suggested several\npossibilities regarding my treatment. I trust you, and I would appreciate\nyour opinion on my options. The doctor said that now that I have finished\ntaking the oral chemotherapy, I could start interferon alpha or, if I want to\nbe “cured,” I should think about a stem cell transplant. The type of leuke-\nmia I have can rapidly change from this chronic phase into acute leukemia.\nIf that happens, it is unlikely that anything would help, and I would not\nhave long to live. The doctor wants me to think about a stem cell transplant.\nHe said I could remain in this holding pattern for years, but there is no\nway of knowing. Or I could have high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell\ntransplant. What do you think?”\nDr. Eyberg respects Dr. Cavanaugh and his capacity to understand the\nrisks and benefits involved in stem cell transplantation. She knows that al-\nlogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only therapy\nproven to cure CML. If Dr. Cavanaugh has a sibling that is a match and has\nthe HSCT within the first year of his diagnosis, he has a better five-year\nsurvival rate than those who undergo HSCT after the first year of diagnosis.\nSo time is of the essence. The two options presented to Dr. Cavanaugh are\nessentially: watch, wait, take the interferon alpha and hope that the disease\nnever progresses or take a chance on HSCT now. The risks of HSCT are sub-\nstantial. The possibility of infection and other complications is very high.\nIt is not inconceivable that Dr. Cavanaugh could die from the HSCT itself.\nSince Dr. Eyberg is part of the cancer treatment team, she is unsure of\nwhere her moral commitment should lie. Should she counsel Dr. Cavanaugh\nto choose the least harmful course of therapy? The conservative route would\nprobably be to watch and wait and take the interferon alpha. Yet, if the\ndisease progresses to acute leukemia, there is little anyone could do to\nhelp Dr. Cavanaugh. However, Dr. Cavanaugh could be in the percentage\nof patients who never progress to this fatal phase of the disease. Even if he\neventually did change to the fatal phase, Dr. Cavanaugh might have many\ngood years with his wife and children until then.\n_ Dr. Eyberg could also counsel Dr. Cavanaugh to choose that option\nthat maximizes the benefit for him. It is hard in this situation to determine\nwhich course of action will do the most good in the long run. Clearly, HSCT\nholds greater risk in the short run but offers the potential for a cure of\nDr. Cavanaugh’s leukemia in the long run.\nFinally, Dr. Eyberg is troubled by the memory of another patient witha\nsimilar diagnosis who recently chose the option of HSCT and did not sur-\nvive the procedure. Given all of these considerations, Dr. Eyberg is not\nsure where to begin.",

He had been diagnosed with a primary tumor of the liver\nat the health maintenance organization (HMO) where he was a member.\nMr. Villanueva had been asymptomatic during the early stages of the tumor’s\ndevelopment. When he was diagnosed the tumor had grown to 5 cm in\ndiameter, which meant it had developed to the point that it was beginning\nto pose a serious risk of metastasis or, in other words, spreading throughout\nhis body. He was informed by his HMO hepatologist, Dr. Edwards, that the\nonly possible therapy was a liver transplant, but given the size of the tumor\nit was not medically appropriate.\nDr. Edwards had researched the options. He discovered that the liver\ntransplant center with which the HMO had a contract would not accept\npatients once the tumor size had reached 5 cm. They reasoned that the\nchances of metastatic disease were sufficiently great that the transplant\nwas unlikely to succeed. On that basis, Dr. Edwards had told his patient\nthat the transplant was not medically indicated.\nMr. Villanueva gradually realized that this was a death sentence. The\nliver cancer would continue to develop until it took his life. He began re-\nsearching the treatment options. He had amassed a sizable estate and\ntraveled internationally reviewing start-up enterprises in which he could\ninvest. He discovered that there was general agreement in the transplant\nworld that liver grafts should not be attempted once the tumor had reached\nthis size but that two centers in the United States and one in Sweden were\nperforming transplants on an experimental basis.\nOn the basis of this discovery Mr. Villanueva returned to his HMO and\nasked if he could once again be considered, given the fact that death was\nthe certain alternative. He expressed concern that his wife and small child\nwould be left without a father and income provider, should he die. When\nDr. Edwards again refused to recommend him for transplant, Mr. Villanueva\ndiscovered that he could appeal his clinician's decision.\nThe case was appealed to the medical director, the final HMO authority\nin such cases. The medical director, Dr. Florence Cunningham, received\nMr. Villanueva's appeal. After a week to investigate the facts, she again\ndenied his request, citing both the clinical judgment that the transplant\nwas not medically appropriate and the fact that one-year cancer-free sur-\nvival following transplant in the programs doing experimental grafts for\nprimary liver tumors was only 5-15 percent. If the tumor has not metasta-\nsized, the transplant will remove the cancer, but in most cases cancer cells\nwill already have migrated beyond the liver. She also noted that livers for\ntransplant were very scarce, life-saving resources and should not be used\nfor patients who have such a small chance of successful transplant.",

He was publicly identified\nby name as a drug dealer who in upstate New York and New York City had\nintentionally had unprotected sexual relations with as many as three hun-\ndred women and adolescent girls, one as young as thirteen years of age.\nAt least thirteen of them had since been found infected with human.\nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV). Mr. Williams had learned of his HIV status\nthe previous September while in Chautauqua County jail on a charge of\nstealing a car. He continued to be sexually active after being told by a\npublic health nurse of his HIV status.\nMr. Williams kept a list of his sexual partners. Thus, it would be possi-\nble to identify them, contact them, and offer testing. In the case of pregnan-\ncies, treatment could be provided, lowering the probability that the newborns\nwould acquire the infection. Mr. Williams, who claimed he suffered from\nschizophrenia, had many contacts with health professionals while in jail\nafter being prosecuted by Chautauqua Country District Attorney James\nSubjack. Although it has never been made public whether the diagnosis of\nschizophrenia has been confirmed, his claim provides a reason why his con-\ntacts with health professionals were so extensive.\nTraditionally, health professionals owe a strict duty of confidentiality to\ntheir patients or clients. The World Medical Association's Declaration of\nGeneva states bluntly, “I will respect the secrets that are confided in me.\" It\nalso states that “the health of my patient will be my first consideration.\"\nOther traditional codes require that the health professional remain\ndedicated to the welfare of the patient. In this case, however, the health\nprofessional who learns of Mr. Williams's aggressive and dangerous be-\nhavior would be aware that his sexual partners are at serious risk from his\nactivity. Moreover, should they become pregnant, their children could re-\nceive life-saving benefit if the women are informed, diagnosed, and treated.\nTheir future sexual partners also have a direct interest in learning of their\nsituation. It is plausible that Mr. Williams has a legal, financial, and psy-\nchological interest in not letting this information be passed to the women\nhe has exposed. If a health professional becomes aware of Mr. Williams's\nbehavior and knows he has a list of the women he has exposed, is that pro-\nfessional's duty exclusively to serve the patient's interest, or must he or she\nin determining the moral duty also take into account the interests of the\nwomen and those associated with them?",

At a major HMO, patients are scheduled _\nat fifteen-minute intervals. Dr. Daniel Hamilton was seeing Stephanie —\nWanzer, a 58-year-old high school teacher, for a routine six-month visit during\n_ which he monitored her high blood pressure and chronic sinus infections. He —\nrepeated the blood pressure readings that had already been taken by the _\nnurse and began an examination of the head and neck. The blood pressure\nreadings were a bit high, 150/90, and he confirmed Ms. Wanzer's complaint\nthat her sinuses were giving her trouble. He reviewed her medications—an _\nACE inhibitor and an antihistamine—and determined that they could be ©\nrefilled. He adjusted the ACE inhibitor dose, increasing it slightly. —\nAt this point, Ms. Wanzer took out a piece of paper indicating she had\nseveral concerns she wanted to raise. She had heard there was a new anti-\nhistamine on the market she wanted to ask about. She was also concerned\nabout difficulty sleeping and about a rash that had recently appeared on\nher upper thigh. This was a pattern Dr. Hamilton had come to expect from _\nher. Generally, he enjoyed having her as a patient. She often had a long list\nof questions. She was intelligent and took notes on Dr. Hamilton's responses.\nAt the same time, Dr. Hamilton realized he was slipping behind on his\nschedule. The examination had already consumed ten minutes. He needed\nthe time for evaluation of the symptoms, exploration, and clarification of the\nphysical exam. He had had to wait for the nurse to return as a chaperone for\nthe examination of the rash. He needed the remaining five minutes for or-\ndering tests and recording notes on the computer. He needed to allow time\nto write the new prescriptions and complete the patient's chart notes. The\nresult was no health education and no consideration of prevention. He felt\nthat he was becoming a test-orderer and prescription writer, usually com-\npleted by rapid judgment or reasonable guess. This behavior, he believed,\nwas driven by the market system and merely “first aid,” far beneath what\nwas owed to a patient in a professional setting. As the fifteen-minute mark\npassed, Ms. Wanzer was still making her way down her list.\nDr. Hamilton's next patient had arrived fifteen minutes early. She was an\n70-year-old patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and\nwas declining with each visit. She was very sick, but Dr. Hamilton feared\nthere was not much he could do but adjust her medication and comfort her,\nalthough he knew well that part of his obligation to patients is to spend time\nwith them in any way that might serve their needs for understanding and for\nemotional support, even if treatment success was not possible.",

He also explained that extensive use of\nantibiotics when they are not necessary can lead to the development of ree\nsistant strains of bacteria. This could eventually mean that some child will\ndevelop an infection from the resistant strain and suffer consequences\nmuch more serious than Tommy's earache because antibiotics had been\nused too often to attempt to treat minor infections, especially those that the\nantibiotic is very unlikely to help.\n_ Mrs. Beauclair responded by stating rather angrily that she was Tommy's\nmother, not the mother of all the children in the future. She pressed Dr. Rust\non whether there was any chance—even a small one—that Tommy's infec-\ntion was from a bacterium that could respond to the antibiotic. She wanted\nto do everything possible to make sure Tommy did not spend another night\nlike he had spent the previous one.\nDr. Rust had always accepted the common wisdom that antibiotics\nwere being overused and should be avoided except in cases in which they\nare necessary to avoid serious medical problems. The antibiotics, he be-\nlieved, should be saved for the truly most needy cases. Still, he acknowl-\nedged to himself that the risks of today’s antibiotics are very low and that\nthere was some small mathematical chance that Tommy had a bacterial\ninfection that would respond to the antibiotic. He realized that, if he fo-\ncused solely on his patient, Mrs. Beauclair was making a good case.\nMrs. Beauclair made him realize that, as a physician who had always be-\nlieved in the Hippocratic Oath, his job was really more to serve the inter-\nests of his patient, just as a mother’s job is to protect her child.

Still,\nshe was not doing well. She suffered cardiac episodes periodically while\nin school or at play leading to repeated calls to the emergency medical\nservices (EMS) personnel. Up to this point, they had always been able to\nresuscitate her and transport her to the emergency room (ER) where eventu-\nally her condition was stabilized.\nNow Dr. Abdul Hamid, the transplant surgeon at the hospital, had in-\nformed Emma and her parents that her only long-term hope was a heart\ntransplant. The child's condition was so severe that she would not survive\nmuch longer without the operation. Even with a transplant, her prognosis\nwas not good: no more than 10-20 percent chance of five-year survival with\nlikely repeated crises related to her damaged lungs and circulatory\nsystem.\nEmma was a remarkable child. She had recently been conducting\nclass sessions in school trying to help her classmates understand what\nwas happening when she would lose consciousness in school, leading to\nrescue personnel rushing in and her fellow students being evacuated from\nthe classroom until she could be removed. She had written an essay pub-\nlished in their local community newspaper describing her situation. The\nteachers had told her parents that, in spite of her many missed school days\nover the years, she tested three years above her grade level.\nShe had read everything she could find about her condition. She knew\nher chances of survival were not good. She had had about all she could\ntake of hospitals, operations, and medical crises. After considerable\nthought she came to the conclusion that the transplant was not worth it. She\nknew the alternative was certain death in the near future. She had also\ncome to understand that an adult in this position would have the legal right\nto refuse consent for the procedure. She told Dr. Hamid that she did not\nwant the transplant.\nShe had discussed the matter at length with her parents, who had re-\nluctantly come to understand her position. They would support her if that is\nwhat she wanted to do.\nDr. Hamid was taken aback. In all his years of cardiac transplant sur-\ngery, he had never had a case like this one. Occasionally, an elderly patient\nwho was rapidly declining and had been advised that he or she was un-\nlikely to survive heart transplant had accepted his advice and declined the\nextreme procedure, but never before had he been confronted with a refusal\nby a 12-year-old who could potentially survive many years if everything\nworked just right.\nDr. Hamid considered the possibility of getting consent from her par-\nents but realized that they might also refuse. He turned to an ethics com-\nmittee, who explained to him that some adolescent minors were considered\nsufficiently mature that they had the authority to make medical decisions\non their own behalf. (Some pregnant adolescents have consented to abor-\ntion on this basis, for instance.) On the other hand, the committee members\nhad never invoked the mature minor rule on someone as young as 12 and\nfor a decision as momentous as a life-ending transplant refusal. Their al-\nternative was to treat her as other 12-year-olds, some of whom might ex-\npress resistance to needed medical procedures. Parental consent is\nnormally acceptable in such cases. However, since the parents might\nthemselves refuse, his only option would be to seek a court order to oper-\n_ ate against the wishes of both the girl and her parents. Should he accept\nthe girl's refusal, rely on the parents’ judgment, or attempt to get the court\norder?",

On the basis of animal studies, he\nhad good reason to believe it would be safe in humans and effective in\nblocking the addiction response by interfering with the site at which heroin\nbinds in the brain. He proposed to recruit former heroin addicts, administer\nthe implant, and then administer heroin to study the response.\nState laws permitted the use of certain. pin cee for-research i titeill ditttyent thin whet pHeonees aul Saar anys Gua ployment. Dr. Turner realized that if his study went as planned, the subjects would experience none of the traditional pleasures of heroin. Nevertheless, in case the drug did not work as hoped, he wanted to make the initial trial of the drug on persons whose environment would be tightly controlled for several years. Furthermore, he needed to control the environment of the subjects during the research period.\nIn order to provide this control, he proposed to do the research on pris-\noners with long enough sentences that they would have time to recover\nshould something go wrong with the experiment. To provide adequate con-\ntrol of the environment during the research, he proposed to move the pris-\noner subjects to the hospital ward of the prison where the prisoner would\nbe placed in a private room with bath. Each prison hospital room had a TV\nand easy chair as well as a t hospital bed.\nWhen Harry Henning saw the notice recruiting subjects, he figured he\nwas an ideal candidate. He had had his life destroyed by his uncontrolla-\nble addiction and would like to make a contribution to society to prevent\nsimilar problems with others in the future. The private room was also ap-\npealing. Should the institutional review board responsible for approving research in the prison permit prisoners such as Mr. Henning to volunteer for this research? If so, can a prisoner in this environment give an adequately free and informed consent?",

Dr. Schenker stated, “We will need to insert a small tube into\nyour chest to withdraw the air and allow the lung to re-expand.”\nMs. Thomas and her husband were relieved to learn that the chest pain\nwas not the result of a heart problem and agreed quickly to the procedure,\nwhich was successful.\nDuring the brief hospital stay, Dr. Schenker and Mr. Thomas, the pa-\ntient's husband, reminisced about their days in high school since they co-\nincidentally attended the same school. Ms. Thomas was seen several times\nfor appropriate follow-up in Dr. Schenker's office after her hospitalization.\nSeveral months later, Dr. Schenker’s business manager reported that the\nbalance of Ms. Thomas's bill had not been paid. Since Dr. Schenker’s office\nhad a policy of not using collection companies, Dr. Schenker said “write the\nbill off.”\nTwo years later, Ms. Thomas was once again in the emergency room\n(ER) for recurrence of the same problem. She requested to be seen by\nDr. Schenker. When the Emergency Department paged Dr. Schenker, he ad-\nvised the staff to call another available thoracic surgeon to see Ms. Thomas.\nA few minutes later, Mr. Thomas called Dr. Schenker directly at his office.\nMr. Thomas admitted he had not paid the earlier bill (although Dr. Schenker\nhad not brought up the matter) and promised to pay the old balance and\nthen prepay for the costs of his wife's current needs. Dr. Schenken replied,\n“It's not about the money but about mutual respect. I am sorry but I cannot\ntake care of your wife at this time. Another thoracic surgeon will take the\ncase so you have nothing to worry about.” Ms. Thomas was treated suc-\ncessfully by another physician. Should Dr. Schenker have relented and\ntaken the case the second time?",

Case 8-4\n8\nA GP Assisting in Surgical Operations:\nStealing Business and Harming Patients?\nAfter completing a lengthy and prestigious residency program, a young\nsurgeon, Diane Daemer, began the difficult process of establishing a solo\npractice. She took frequent calls from ERs, did insurance physical exams,\nwent to all hospital staff meetings, did not take vacation, and so on. The\npractice grew slowly, and she was gratified when a busy general practitio-\nner, David Parish, referred a patient with lung cancer for her evaluation.\nWhen an operation was recommended, the referring doctor asked to assist\nin the procedure, a custom not unusual in her community. She agreed and\nthe procedure subsequently went well, after her usual meticulous preop-\nerative care and communication with all parties.\nThree weeks later, the same GP referred a patient who needed a par-\ntial resection of the stomach. Again, Dr. Parish assisted in the operation.\nFurther operative cases followed. Then Dr. Parish spoke of his interest in\ndoing “simple operations like hernia repairs and appendectomies” with\nDr. Daemer assisting him. She politely refused, feeling manipulated be-\ncause of the previous referrals, and was unwilling to “cover” the lack of\nsurgical credentials of the other. The surgeon came to believe that the ar-\nrangement was a deception, clearly not in the interest of the patients.",

        "case": "Case 8-5 :\nProfiting from Self-Referral for MRIs\nFor many years internist Jonathan Birch had performed x-rays on his pa-\ntients in his private office. He billed them a reasonable charge for the time\nand materials involved, including enough to amortize the costs of the\nequipment. By the late 1980s Dr. Birch was making increased use of more\nsophisticated imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. By comparison, this equip-\nment was extremely expensive and would not be utilized sufficiently to\njustify having the equipment in his office. He began referring patients\nneeding this type of diagnostic test to an imaging center at the local hos-\npital. Patients were billed directly by the hospital. This had the effect of\nreducing Dr. Birch’s income that he used to derive from the simpler in-\noffice procedures.\nIn 1989 Dr. Birch was approached by Imaging Resources, Inc., about a\nnew free-standing imaging facility it was launching. Dr. Birch was invited\nto visit the facility and inspect its state-of-the-art equipment. Dr. Birch was\nimpressed. He considered it better than the hospital's facility and was con-\nsidering shifting his referrals to the new center.\nThe director of the center then presented an offer to Dr. Birch. He was\ninvited to invest in the center. He could buy a 1 percent interest in the facil-\nity with income on the investment projected as 12 percent. Furthermore, the\nfacility would loan Dr. Birch the money he needed to make the investment\nat 6 percent interest with the interest and principal paid off with the earn-\nings on the investment. As soon as the investment was paid off, Dr. Birch\nwould own his share in the company and would receive profits on his\nownership.\nDr. Birch realized that the more patients he referred, the better the im-\naging business would do. In effect, he would be able to recoup some of the\nincome he had lost when he shifted from x-rays in his office to the use of the\noutside imaging facility at the hospital. Dr. Birch was vaguely uncomfort-\nable with the offer he received. It could be interpreted as giving him an\nownership interest in order to influence his decisions about when to order\nimaging and what facility to recommend. He was made more uncomfort-\nable when he learned that only physicians were being offered the favor-\nable investment terms. He learned that only colleagues who did substantial\namounts of referral for imaging were approached. Even so, Dr. Birch accepted\nthe offer and the loan.\nFollow-up\nBy 1991 the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was taking action\nagainst some of these joint-venture investment schemes that gave the ap-\npearance of being designed to provide financial incentives to physicians to\nchannel business to certain imaging centers. There were accusations of\nkickbacks. In response, the government issued regulations that provided\n“safe harbors,” provisions which, if met, would give physicians assurance\nthat they would not be guilty of violating anti-kickback laws. The original\nprovisions made clear that investment in large, public corporations (such as\ndrug companies) was acceptable, that physicians could provide services to\njoint ventures for a reasonable fee, and that investment terms (such as the\nloan received by Dr. Birch) had to be available to all investors, not just doc-\ntors who referred patients.* Later amendments clarified these provisions, but\nthey remain in place essentially as originally promulgated. More recently,\nregulations governing self-referral have appeared in 2001, 2004, and 2007,\nand in 2010 a Medicare self-referral disclosure protocol was published pur-\nsuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare).°\nAs a result of these regulations, Dr. Birch decided to repay the loan and\nmade an effort to assure that the company made a good faith effort to con-\nform to all the provisions of the safe-harbor regulations. He was convinced\nthat the company, of which he was now a minority owner, was the best fa-\ncility in town and that he would never refer a patient in order to increase\nthe profits of the company. Still, he was concerned about whether this ar-\nrangement was ethical.",

She was well aware that\nmost of the patients on the post-critical care unit where she worked were at\nhigh risk for skin impairment because they were elderly and often dehy-\ndrated and malnourished in addition to other chronic health problems. As\npart of each admission, the nursés on all of the units in the hospital were\nrequired to inspect newly admitted patients from head to toe to determine\nthe general condition of the skin. This inspection included assessment of the\nskin over bony prominences such as the sacrum, trochanters, and even\nthe elbows and heels. Needless to say, this part of the overall patient assess-\nment took time and often the involvement of more than one nurse since many\nof the patients were unable to stand or roll over in the bed without assis-\ntance. For the past month, Ms. Orlando suspected that a new nurse on the\nfloor, Nancy Hess, RN, didn't share her view about the importance of good\nskin assessment. One reason for her suspicion was that Ms. Hess never\nasked for help during her assessments of new patients. Another reason that\nMs. Orlando thinks Ms. Hess is just filling in the computer form and not really\nchecking her patients’ skin condition is that, when she works on the evening\nshift and takes care of Ms. Hess's patients, she found skin problems with\npatients that Ms. Hess hadn't documented on the admission assessment.\nSkin problems can develop relatively quickly, but it is highly unlikely that\nthey developed within a single shift. Ms. Orlando tried to be subtle and help-\nful to Ms. Hess by pointing out high-risk patients and offering to help with the\nskin assessment, yet Ms. Hess never asked for Ms. Orlando's or anyone else's\nhelp. Ms. Orlando spoke to the head nurse on the unit to share her concerns,\nand that seemed to result in some improvement for a short time, but then\nMs. Hess returned to her previous behavior. Ms. Orlando believes that\nMs. Hess's treatment of patients in this regard is substandard and poten-\ntially dangerous for this vulnerable population of patients.",

No offense meant, you understand. I just can’t afford\nto pay for pills and not get them.”\nMr. Janowski's prescriptions had been filled by the owner of the phar-\nmacy, Glen Battin, R.Ph., who would not be in for several hours. Dr. Lance\ndecided to humor Mr. Janowski and opened the first bottle. To her dismay,\nthe prescription was four tablets short. She made up the difference. The\nremaining two prescriptions were also short by the same amount—four\npills each. Dr. Lance remedied the shortage in these two and returned all\nthree prescriptions to Mr. Janowski. “I guarantee you that these are filled\naccurately and fully,” Dr. Lance told Mr. Janowski as she handed him his\nmedications.\nMr. Janowski was not the only patient with concerns about shortages\nthat day. Evidently, several patients were prompted by the newspaper ar-\nticle to count their pills and found less than there should have been.\nDr. Lance took numerous calls from angry patients and tried to determine if\nthe caller might have miscounted, lost a pill, or took more than they should\nhave, all reasons that the prescriptions could appear short. She noted that\nall of the prescriptions that patients claimed were shorted were for mainte-\nnance drugs and that Mr. Battin had filled them. _\nWhen Mr. Battin arrived at the pharmacy, an exhausted Dr. Lance told\nhim about what she had discovered and the number of dissatisfied pa-\ntients that called to complain about shortages. She was certain Mr. Battin\nwould have a reasonable explanation. He stated, “It's really a shame that\nadvice column printed that letter. We'll have to stop shorting maintenance\nprescriptions for a while until people get over the excitement and the need\nto count every prescription.”\nDr. Lance could not believe what she was becreg. ‘You mean that you\nhave been shorting prescriptions?” Mr. Battin shrugged, “Just the mainte-\nnance prescriptions and only on the higher-end products. People don't miss\nthree or four pills a month and the pharmacy recoups a steady amount. ©\nBesides, they always come in for a refill before they run out, so the patients\naren't harmed.” /\nDr. Lance had always admired Mr. Battin, but his nonchalant admis-\nsion of guilt instantly changed her appraisal of her employer. She had\nnever knowingly shorted a prescription. How could she work for someone\nwho did it as a matter of course? Furthermore, what should she do about\nthis dishonest behavior?",

        "case": "Case 9-1]\nJack Kevorkian: Merciful Homicide, Suicide,\nand Forgoing Life Support\nFifty-two-year-old Thomas Youk suffered from amyotrophic lateral sclero-\nsis (ALS, sometimes called Lou Gehrig's disease). In the fall of 1998, he was\nhaving difficulty breathing and swallowing. He contacted Jack Kevorkian,\nknown as “Dr. Death.” Dr. Kevorkian, a pathologist whose license to prac-\ntice medicine had been revoked, had through the 1990s assisted in the\nsuicides of over one hundred people who had requested help in ending\ntheir lives. Prior to the case of Mr. Youk, apparently all of the deaths in\nwhich Kevorkian had been involved were suicides. Dr. Kevorkian provided\ncounsel and then helped the individuals by inserting an intravenous (IV)\nline or attaching a mask. Harmless saline or air was initially flowing\nthrough the equipment. In these cases, the patients themselves took the\nlast step in the chain of events that led to their deaths. They turned a stop-\ncock or control so that lethal potassium chloride or carbon monoxide began\nto flow, the eventual cause of the deaths.\nSince the patients themselves took the action responsible for their\ndeaths, these were considered assisted suicides rather than homicides. Even\nassisting in a suicide has generally been considered illegal. Dr. Kevorkian\nwas prosecuted no fewer than three times. In each of these cases he was\nacquitted. The jurors, perhaps out of sympathy for his actions, found some\nreason for finding him not guilty. Problems in proving his involvement, in\nestablishing the jurisdiction, or other technicalities were sometimes cited.\nIn Thomas Youk’s case, he was suffering from a disease that caused\nparalysis while leaving him mentally lucid. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's\nassistance in ending his life but was physically not able to take the final\naction leading to his death. He requested that Dr. Kevorkian inject a lethal\nsubstance to end his life.\nDr. Kevorkian had long been attempting to change the law about inten-\ntional merciful killing. To force the issue before the courts and general\npublic, he videotaped the final moments of Mr. Youk’s life and released the\nvideo to the CBS television program 60 Minutes.\nOn September 15, Dr. Kevorkian went to Mr. Youk’s home to discuss his\nsituation. The interaction was videotaped showing Mr. Youk requesting\nhelp in “ending his suffering.” Dr. Kevorkian indicated that Youk needed to\nagree to a statement: a consent to “direct injection.” The statement to which\nhe agreed read:\n“I, Thomas Youk, the undersigned, entirely voluntarily, without any res-\nervation, external persuasion, pressure, or duress, and after prolonged and\nthorough deliberation, hereby consent to the following medical procedure\nof my own choosing, and that I have chosen direct injection, or what they\ncall active euthanasia, to be administered by a competent medical profes-\nsional, in order to end with certainty my intolerable and hopelessly incur-\nable suffering.”\nOn September 16, 1998, at 9:49 p.m., Dr. Kevorkian again videotaped his\ninteraction with Mr. Youk. After asking Mr. Youk to reaffirm his desire to go\nthrough with the plan, Dr. Kevorkian injected Anectine (a paralyzing drug)\nand Seconal (a sedative) before injecting potassium chloride (a lethal drug\nthat stops the heart). Most people who have viewed the videotape have no\ndoubt that Mr. Youk knew exactly what was happening, was mentally lucid,\nand desired to have the injection.\nDr. Kevorkian was tried before the Oakland County, Michigan, Circuit\nCourt, found guilty of second degree murder, and sentenced to 10-25 years\nin jail. He was paroled on June 1, 2007.",

The precise events leading up to her admission\nto Newton Memorial Hospital are unclear. She apparently ceased breath-\ning for at least two fifteen-minute periods. Mouth-to -mouth resuscitation\nwas applied by her friends the first time and by a police respirator the\nsecond time. The exact amount of time she was without spontaneous respi-\nration is unknown.\nUpon her admission to Newton Memorial, urine and blood tests indi-\ncated the presence of quinine, aspirin, and barbiturates in normal range as\nwell as traces of valium and Librium. Dr. Robert Morse, the neurologist in\ncharge of her care, found the drugs to be in the therapeutic range and the\nquinine consistent with mixing in drinks like soda water. The interruption\nin respiration apparently caused anoxia—insufficient supply of oxygen in\nthe blood—resulting in her present condition.\nAt 10 p.m. on April 16, 1975, Dr. Morse again examined Karen. He found\nher in a coma with evidence of what he called decortication indicating an\naltered level of consciousness. She required the respirator for assistance.\nShe did not breathe spontaneously.\nKaren was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) of St. Clare’s\nHospital, under the care of Dr. Morse. At the time of her transfer she was\nstill unconscious, still on a respirator, a catheter was inserted into her blad-\nder, and a tracheostomy had been performed.\nDr. Morse testified Karen changed from a sleeping comatose condition\nto a sleep-awake type comatose condition but described this as normal in\ncomatose patients and not any indication of improvement. He indicated that\nduring the awake cycle, she was still unconscious. He claimed that Karen\nwas not brain dead but would not return to a level of cognitive function.\nKaren was examined by several experts for the various parties. All\nagreed she was in a persistent vegetative state. She had irreversible brain\ndamage and no cognitive or cerebral functioning; chances for useful sapi-\nent life or return of discriminative functioning were considered remote.\nKaren's parents, Joseph and Julia Quinlan, assumed responsibility for the\ncare of their daughter. The decision to request that she be removed from the\nrespirator, understandably, came tortuously, arduously to the Quinlans. At\nthe outset, they authorized Dr. Morse to do everything he could to keep her\nalive, believing she would recover. They participated in a constant vigil\nover her with other family members. They were in constant contact with the\ndoctors, particularly Dr. Morse, receiving day-by-day reports concerning\nher prognosis, which, as time passed, became more and more pessimistic\nand more and more discouraging to them.\nMrs. Quinlan and the children were the first to conclude Karen should\nbe removed from the respirator. Mrs. Quinlan, working at the local parish\nchurch, had ongoing talks with Father Trapasso, who supported her conclu-\nsion and indicated that it was a permissible practice within the tenets of\nRoman Catholic teachings.\nMr. Quinlan was slower in making his decision. His hope for recovery\ncontinued despite the disheartening medical reports. Neither his wife nor\nFather Trapasso made any attempt to influence him. A conflict existed be-\ntween letting her natural body functioning control her life and the hope for\nrecovery. Once having made the decision, he sought Father Trapasso’s en-\ncouragement, which he received.\nFather Trapasso based his support of the position taken by the Quin-\nlans on the traditional, moral precepts of the Roman Catholic faith and\nupon a declaration by Pope Pius XII made on November 24, 1957. Father\nTrapasso acknowledges it is not a sinful act under the church teachings or\nthe Papal statement to either continue extraordinary treatment or discon-\ntinue it. It is acknowledged to be a matter left optional to a Roman Catholic\nbeliever. Mr. Quinlan indicates that had Roman Catholic traditions and\nmorals considered it a sin, he would not be seeking termination of the re-\nspiratory support. Mr. Quinlan held that Karen’s natural bodily functions\nshould be allowed to operate free of the respirator. He stated then, if it is\nGod's will to take her, she can go on to life after death.\nThe Quinlans, on July 31, 1975, signed the following statement:\nWe authorize and direct Doctor Morse to discontinue all extraordinary mea-\nsures, including the use of a respirator for our daughter Karen Quinlan.\nWe acknowledge that the above-named physician has thoroughly dis-\ncussed the above with us and that the consequences have been fully ex-\nplained to us. Therefore, we hereby RELEASE from any and all liability the\nabove-named physician, associates and assistants of his choice, Saint\nClare's Hospital and its agents and employees.\nThe Quinlans, upon signing the release, considered the matter de-\ncided. Dr. Morse, however, felt he could not and would not agree to the ces-\nsation of the respirator assistance. He advised the Quinlans prior to the\ntime of their signing the release that he wanted to check into the matter\nfurther before giving his approval. After checking on other medical case\nhistories, he concluded that terminating the respirator would be a substan-\ntial deviation from medical tradition, that it involved ascertaining “quality\nof life,” and that he would not do so.\nKaren Quinlan was quoted as saying she never wanted to be kept\nalive by extraordinary means. The statements attributed to her by her\nmother, sister, and a friend are indicated to have been made essentially in\nrelation to instances where close friends or relatives were terminally ill.\n[Karen's father] urges the Court to act in Karen Quinlan’s best interest\nby authorizing the cessation of the respirator. He asserts Karen Quinlan\nand her family have a constitutional right of privacy that lead to a right of\nself-determination which extends to the decision to terminate “futile use\nof extraordinary medical measures.” He also asserts a constitutional right\nof free exercise of religious belief and freedom from cruel and unusual\npunishment as grounds for granting the sought relief.\nThe doctors and hospital essentially contend, since Karen Quinlan is\nmedically and legally alive, the Court should not authorize termination of\nthe respirator, that to do so would be homicide and an act of euthanasia.\nThe doctors suggest the decision is one more appropriately made by\ndoctors than by a court of law and that, under the circumstances of this\ncase, a decision in favor of the parents would require ascertainment of\nquality-of-life standards to serve as future guidelines.",

When they discovered Mrs. Attard was carrying\nconjoined twins, they traveled to Manchester, England, since no adequate\nfacility to care for the babies existed at their home. The twins, Gracie and\nRosie, were born at St. Mary's Hospital in Manchester on August 8, 2000.\nThe twins were joined at the abdomen. Gracie was described as bright and\nalert with an anatomically normal brain, heart, lungs, and liver. Rosie, on\nthe other hand, had significant brain pathology and relied on Gracie’s\nheart and lungs for her blood supply. Separating the twins would mean the\ncertain death of Rosie, but Gracie had a good chance of survival with\nmoderate physical impairment that would require further operations to\ncorrect. Without intervention to separate the twins, they would both die\nwithin three to six months.\nThe parents, Roman Catholics, said they wanted “God's will” to pre-\nvail and refused permission for the operation. They could not accept the\nidea of killing one by cutting off her blood supply in order for the other to\nsurvive. They were willing to accept the death of both, if necessary, but\nfound intentional action that would end one of the lives to save the other\nunacceptable. While the main focus of their reported objection was the\nmoral problem of sacrificing one for the benefit of the other, they were also\nquoted as expressing concern that neither they nor their home country\nwould be able to provide the special care that Gracie would require. If\nmedical treatment necessary to preserve life was “gravely burdensome” to\nthe patient or others, Roman Catholicism has long recognized the legiti-\nmacy of forgoing life support.\nThe doctors at St. Mary’s Hospital sought court authorization to per-\nform the procedure against the parents’ wishes, and the courts ultimately\ngranted that request. The lower court attempted to claim that the operation\nthat would lead to Rosie’s death was not a case of killing, but rather the\nwithdrawal of nutrition and hydration by clamping off her blood supply. It\nwas deemed “passive” euthanasia rather than active killing. The court ac-\nknowledged that the physicians felt they had a medical moral duty to pre-\nserve the life that could be preserved and their “collective medical\nconscience” would suffer if not authorized to proceed. When the parents\nappealed the lower court decision, the appeals court justices gave differ-\ning arguments but affirmed the right of the doctors to proceed. One ap-\npeals court judge rejected the claim that cutting off the blood supply was\nan omission of treatment rather than active killing. He argued that it cannot\nbe claimed that the procedure was in Rosie's best interest. Nevertheless, he\nendorsed it, claiming that Rosie could be viewed as killing Gracie by her\nattachment to Gracie’s blood supply. The action was thus labeled “self-\ndefense” from Gracie’s perspective.\nA second appeals court justice framed his support of the intervention\nin what he called the “doctrine of necessity.” He cited an analogy to a\nmountain climber justified in cutting the rope binding him to a companion\nwho had fallen when, unless he frees himself, both will die.\nThe third justice concluded that remaining conjoined to Gracie would\nbe of no benefit to Rosie and would actually be to her disadvantage. He\nclaimed that the doctors’ duties to Gracie and Rosie were in conflict. He\nnotes that the intent of the doctors was not to kill Rosie, but to give each\ntwin “bodily integrity” and that such independent existence was in the in-\nterest of each. He cited the conclusion of the physicians, stating that “Highly\nskilled and conscientious doctors believe that the best course, in the\ninterests of both twins, is to undertake elective surgery in order to separate\nthem and save Gracie.”\nThe procedure was performed on November 7, 2000. Rosie died imme-\ndiately when her blood vessels were cut. Gracie continued to survive with\nthe expectation that she would need years of surgical care. At last report,\nshe was alive and apparently doing well over a decade later.",

It is testimony to the evolution of the right of patients and their\nsurrogates to refuse medical treatment in the days since Karen Quinlan\nthat Mr. Whittemore’s right to refuse on these grounds was not challenged\nlegally even though the gangrene was a serious, possibly life-threatening\ncondition. While she was hospitalized in conjunction with the treatment of\nthe gangrene, medical personnel noticed that Miss Conroy was not receiv-\ning adequate nourishment and placed a naso-gastric (NG) tube to provide\nbetter nutrition. By 1983, when the case became public, she was totally de-\npendent on the tube for feeding.\nMiss Conroy had many other medical problems. In addition to the\nsevere organic brain syndrome, she had necrotic decubitus ulcers on her\nleft foot, leg, and hip, a urinary tract infection, hypertension, arterioscle-\nrotic heart disease, and diabetes mellitus and was unable to move except\nfor minor movements of her head, neck, and arms. She did not speak. She\nlay in a fetal position, only sometimes followed people with her eyes, and\nher general physical appearance was very withered. She moaned when\nmoved or touched. It was unclear whether she was capable of experiencing\npain. She showed no signs of cognitive or volitional functioning.\nUsing reasoning similar to that in defending the refusal of the amputa-\ntion, Mr. Whittemore now insisted that the NG tube be removed.\nThe doctors were reluctant to go along. They accepted the legitimacy of\nrefusing ventilators or amputations but considered provision of food and\nfluids as basic medical care, something they expected to provide to all\npatients who needed them.",

        "case": "Case 9-5\nTerri Schiavo: Choosing to Forgo Nutrition\nTerri Schindler married Michael Schiavo on November 10, 1984. They\nwere apparently happy together living with her parents until February 25,\n1990, when their lives changed dramatically. She suffered cardiac arrest\nresulting in massive brain damage before she was stabilized at the hospi-\ntal. At the time a potassium imbalance was noted. Terri had a history of\ndieting, and some suspected that her medical crisis was triggered by her\neating behavior, but the actual cause was never determined. Although\nsome later suggested abuse, no evidence related to abuse was ever\nuncovered.\nIn June of 1990, Michael was appointed as her legal guardian. He made\nefforts to find treatments that might restore normal brain function, even\ntaking Terri to California for experimental brain stimulator treatment and\na thalamic stimulator implant. These efforts proved unsuccessful, and\nTerri was left severely compromised.\nIn 1992, Michael won a malpractice award resulting from claims re-\nlated to inadequate treatment when she was first treated. A trust fund for\nTerri's care amounting to $750,000 and damages for Michael of $300,000\nwas established as a result. Perhaps related to disputes over the money\nand differences over Terri's treatment, Michael and his in-laws had a fall-\ning out.\nBy 1998 the tensions had crystallized, focusing on whether it was ap-\npropriate to continue medically supplied nutrition and hydration for Terri.\nIn May of that year, Michael petitioned the court to remove the feeding\ntube. Terri‘s parents opposed this action. This was only the first of many\ncourt reviews addressing the decision to forgo the feeding tube.\nThe court battles dealt with the question of whether Terri was in a per-\nsistent vegetative state (PVS) and therefore by this time presumably per-\nmanently unconscious and, if so, whether she would want the tube\nremoved.\nBy the year 2000 the court had reviewed the findings of experts in neu-\nrology and had determined that Terri was indeed in PVS, thus agreeing\nwith the majority of the experts. At this and other court reviews, two court-\nappointed temporary guardians also concurred with that finding. The court\nalso concluded that Terri would want the feeding tube removed under\nthese conditions.\nDuring this time, Terri's parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, disputed the\nfindings both about Terri’s wishes and about her mental state. They testi-\nfied that she had not ever expressed wishes to forgo medically supplied\nnutrition, thus contradicting testimony of Michael, his brother, and his sister-\nin-law. They also insisted that she appeared to respond to them. Their views\nwere supported by one physician who concurred in their judgment that she\nappeared aware of them at times. Nevertheless, after reviewing the evi-\ndence, the courts and the guardians all concluded she would not want the\nfeeding tube under her present circumstances. ]\nAfter many appeals in both state and federal courts and attempted\ninterventions by the U.S. Congress and President George W. Bush, the orig-\ninal ruling authorizing the withholding of the feeding tube was sustained.\nIt was removed for the final time on March 18, 2005. Terri died on March 31.\nThe Schindlers continue to insist that she was not vegetative, had not ex-\npressed a desire to have the tube removed, and should not have had it\nremoved.",

        "case": "Case 9-6\nAssisted Suicide, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Depression\nKathleen Rheel was a 56-year-old, married, former schoolteacher in the\nOregon public schools who had retired from teaching five years previously\nbecause the daily grind had become too much for her. She had two years\nbefore been diagnosed by Michael Carver, her internist, as showing the\ninitial signs of Alzheimer's disease. She and her husband had never had\nchildren. She believed her friends had not realized her situation, but she\nhad noticed an increasing inability to remember names, and her husband\ndetected that she was forgetting birthdays and appointments. She feared\nher symptoms were getting worse. She and her husband had discussed a\nplan to hire a housekeeper, anticipating the time when she would not be\nable to be left by herself. She had become increasingly distressed at these\nprospects. She had always been a lover of knowledge. She read constantly, and she and her\nhusband enjoyed attending adult education classes and local theater. She\nhated the thought of a life without these basic pleasures. Her life was grad-\nually becoming unbearable.\nMs. Rheel was horrified at the prospect of a gradual decline in her\nmental abilities and the economic impact on her husband if she would\nneed care for a prolonged period. She explored the prognosis with\nDr. Carver, who indicated that he thought the disease was progressing but\nthat she would be quite capable of managing her own affairs and enjoying\nlife for some years to come.\nDuring one of her appointments with Dr. Carver, she asked about the\nterms of the Oregon law that permits physicians to assist in the suicide of\nterminally ill patients. Dr. Carver was reluctant to discuss it. He had origi-\nnally been opposed to the law, believing that the physician’s task is to pro-\nmote health rather than cause the deaths of patients. Gradually, however,\nhe had become convinced that some patients suffered terribly in spite of\nreceiving the best medical care available. He believed in hospice care but\nrealized that some patients, such as Ms. Rheel, were not candidates. Her\nsuffering was not physical. Even high-quality psychiatric and social work\ncare were not going to address her increasing misery.\nDr. Carver knew that the Oregon assisted suicide law applied only to\npatients who were 18 years of age, capable of making and communicating\ntheir own health care decisions, and had a terminal illness that would lead\nto death within six months. He explained that Ms. Rheel would not qualify\nsince, although the Alzheimer's disease would likely eventually be related\nto her death, she did not have a terminal illness that would lead to death\nwithin six months.\nOver the course of the next year, Ms. Rheel’s condition worsened some-\nwhat. Her depression became more pronounced, although in Dr. Carver's\nopinion she was clearly still mentally competent. At an appointment with\nDr. Carver, she pressed more aggressively. She informed him that she had\ndecided that she did not want to live with her deteriorating condition. She\nand her husband had made all arrangements; her will had been reviewed,\nshe had begun giving some of her possessions to friends and relatives, and\nshe was now serious about discussing Dr. Carver's assistance. Dr. Carver\nstrongly urged her to accept a referral to a psychiatrist, but she declined.\nThis continued for three additional appointments. It was clear to\nDr. Carver that she was increasingly committed to ending her life. She had\nclearly thought through the decision carefully and would likely choose\nnonmedical means if he did not cooperate. He was concerned that the\nOregon law would not condone his prescribing of a lethal agent, since his\npatient was not terminal according to the terms of the law. He reasoned,\nhowever, that, as she became increasingly suicidal without the hope of\npsychiatric care, she, in fact, would commit suicide within the next six\nmonths. He knew that the Oregon law left it up to the physician to deter-\nmine whether the six-month criterion had been met. Fearing the bad conse-\nquences of her suicide using nonmedical means, he seriously explored\nwhether to write a prescription for barbiturates that would, with medical\nsupervision, lead to her death. If he determined she met the terms of the\nlaw and remained mentally competent, he believed he could, with reluc-\ntance, write the prescription. Ms. Rheel died with her husband and\nDr. Carver at her side. Her death was reported under the terms of the law.",

The results of a routine preg-\nnancy test revealed that, in spite of her great efforts to avoid it, she had con-\nceived and was then seven-and-a-half weeks pregnant. The pulmonologist\ncounseled her that her safest course of action was to end the pregnancy,\nsince in the best case, pregnancy with pulmonary hypertension carries a\n10-15 percent risk of mortality for a pregnant woman trying to carry to term,\nand because of the severity of her disease her own prospects were closer to\n90-50. The woman, a Catholic with four children, decided not to terminate.\nOn November 3, 2009, the woman was admitted to St. Joseph's Hospi-\ntal and Medical Center in Phoenix with worsening symptoms.

She signed an affidavit claiming she wished to ter-\nminate her pregnancy by an abortion. She wanted it done by a competent,\nlicensed physician and under safe, clinical conditions. Although there has\nbeen some dispute about whether the affidavit stated her actual wishes, it\nstated she was distressed that her right of privacy was put in jeopardy be-\ncause the Texas law was so vague that physicians might be reluctant to\nperform an abortion for a woman in her situation out of fear that it would be\nillegal.\nMs. McCorvey was a working-class blue-collar woman of 24 who\nthought of herself as tough-talking and of unrefined ways. She was raised\nas a poor Louisiana girl who had spent a good part of her childhood in\nreform schools. She ran away from home when she was 10, then supported\nherself with odd jobs as a carnival barker, waitress, cleaner of apartments,\nand construction worker. She had had three previous pregnancies, all of\nwhich had resulted in live births with the children placed for adoption. In\none case, the removal of the child was against her will. She realized she\ndid not meet the criterion of wanting to discontinue a pregnancy to save her\nlife or prevent serious medical problems. She was simply at a point at\nwhich financially, psychologically, and emotionally she should not have\nmore children.\nJames Hubert Hallford, who was a licensed physician in Texas, entered\nthe case testifying that he, in fact, was sufficiently concerned about the\nvagueness of the Texas law that he feared performing abortions. He had\nbeen arrested for performing them and had two prosecutions pending. He\nargued that he could not tell whether his participation in an abortion for a\npatient like Norma McCorvey was legal, that the law was too vague, and\nthat it violated the privacy of the doctor—patient relation and his own right\nto practice medicine.\nThis case became world-famous when Ms. McCorvey was referred to\nas Jane Roe of the 1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that declared\nlaws restricting abortions unconstitutional. Now that abortion is legal,\nwomen like Ms. McCorvey must make the ethical choice of whether an\nabortion for psychological and socioeconomic reasons like hers would be\nmorally justified.'",

They had two op-\ntions for testing. They could undergo IVF and have the resulting embryos\ntested using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).

Since not all implanted\nembryos would develop, typically two or three would be implanted hoping\nthat at least one would survive to birth.\nThe Merriks were aware that it was a challenging and expensive\noption. Mrs. Merrik would have to be treated to make egg cells available\nthat could be procured and fertilized with her husband's sperm. The cost\ncould be upward of $25,000 that their insurance would not cover, depend-\ning on the number of cycles involved. They would face the daunting task of\nselecting from the embryos that would be chosen to survive, a task Mrs.\nMerrik thought would be like “playing God.” Remaining healthy embryos\nas well as any with the HNPCC genetic mutation would be discarded\nunless they chose to freeze them for future implantation or to donate them\nto another couple who was infertile or for research. They had moral doubts\nabout all these options.\nTheir second option for having a child that was genetically their own\nwould be to conceive naturally and then have the fetus tested prenatally\nfor the presence of the mutation. They would have to wait for eleven to\ntwelve weeks for testing by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or at least four-\nteen weeks to have amniocentisis in which amniotic fluid would be with-\ndrawn to have fetal cells recovered and tested. The risk of either CVS or\namniocentesis was a small risk of interrupting the pregnancy (about 1 per-\ncent). They had a 50-50 chance that any offspring would not have the gene.\nIf it did, they could choose abortion if they remained committed to avoiding\nchildren with the gene. This approach would require a more substantial\nmedical procedure—a midterm abortion if amniocentisis were used. It\nwould also raise the moral issues of abortion for a serious but not uniformly\nfatal medical condition. Although discarding embryos after IVF could also\nbe thought of as abortion, some would think of a mid-term abortion\ndifferently.\nAdding to the complexity of their choice was the fact that not all people\nwith the HNPCC mutation would get clinically significant colon cancer.\nAbout 80 percent of persons with the gene eventually develop it. For those\ndeveloping the cancer, death will result without treatment, but removal of\nthe colon and perhaps the rectum could provide a good chance of survival.\nThis could result in the need for a colostomy, but the gene did not mean a\ncertain death from this kind of cancer. The risk for other cancers would\nremain, just as in any other person.\nThey had the additional options of waiting io test the offspring postno-\ntally, perhaps waiting until the child had matured to the point that he or\nshe could decide about when to test, or having a child that was not carry-\ning Mr. Merrik’s genes—either through adoption or artificial insemination.\nWas prenatal testing through PGD or amniocentesis acceptable, and, if so,\nwas one of them morally preferable?",

        "case": "Case i 2\nDwarfism: When Is a Fetus Normal?\nObstetrician Elizabeth Whistler asked for a bioethics consultation to con-\nsider the request of Charles and Amanda Harrelson for genetic testing and\na possible elective abortion. Mrs. Harrelson, who was pregnant for the first\ntime, was three months into an apparently normal pregnancy. She and her\nhusband were both achondroplastic dwarfs. They seemingly were finan-\ncially comfortable and well adjusted to their physical conditions. They had\nrequested testing of their developing fetus for evidence of achondroplasia.\nAchondroplastic dwarfism is a bone growth disorder in which carti-\nlage is not properly converted into bone. Adult males develop to an average\nheight of about four feet, four inches; females average about three inches\nshorter. While trunk size is normal, arms and legs are short and the head is\nenlarged, featuring a prominent forehead. Intelligence is generally normal.\nPhysical problems include bouts of apnea (periods in which breathing\nstops), obesity, bowed legs, and abnormalities of the lower back. Back pain\nis common in older people with the condition.\nThe condition results from a mutation in a single gene, the FGFR3\n(fibroblast growth factor 3) gene. It occurs once in every 15,000 to 40,000\nbirths, but if both parents have the gene, one child in four will inherit two\ncopies, which results in severe effects, usually stillbirth or death from re-\nspiratory failure soon after birth. One child in four will not inherit any copies\nand will not be affected. Two in four will inherit one copy and have dwart-\nism, the same characteristics as their parents.\nPrenatal diagnosis for the presence of the abnormal gene is now pos-\nsible. Since incidence is so rare, if neither parent has the condition, testing\nwould not normally be carried out. If both parents are affected, then testing\nwould become more plausible. Any fetus with two copies of the gene could\nbe aborted.\nDr. Whistler was discussing the diagnostic procedure with Mr. and\nMrs. Harrelson and helping them understand their options. It became ap-\nparent to her that their intention was to abort not only any fetus with two\ncopies of the gene but also any child with no copies. If the fetus was not\nachondroplastic, they would have the pregnancy aborted because they did\nnot want to rear a child obviously different from themselves.",

        "case": "Case 11-3\nSickle Cell and Black Genocide\nWilbur Johnson and Mae Sanford, both African American, had met while\nworking on a community action project in a large Eastern city. After going\ntogether for a year, they decided to get married and have a family.\nMr. Johnson's physician, Lester Kettering, asked if Mr. Johnson knew\nhis sickle cell status and explained that if both he and his future wife were\ncarriers, they had one chance in four that any child born to them would\nhave the disease. He further explained that they would also have two\nchances in four that a child would be a carrier, while in one of four births\nthe offspring would carry no copies of the gene. Dr. Kettering also explained\nthat it was state law that any children born would be routinely tested for\nsickle cell status, unless the parents registered their objection.\nThe disease itself is an inherited abnormality in the structure of hemo-\nglobin, which at a minimum almost always severely handicaps its victims.\nLife expectancy now, as a result of better treatment, has increased, but aver-\nage age of death is still in the forties. Sickle cell disease is autosomal reces-\nsive; that is, both parents must have at least one copy of the gene before\nthere is a risk of producing children with the disease (homozygotes). When\nboth parents are carriers, the risk of bearing such a child is 25 percent with\neach pregnancy. Carriers themselves are almost symptomless and may\nhave no idea of their status unless they are screened.\nMr. Johnson's younger brother died in adolescence from the disease,\nafter many painful and debilitating attacks. He thus knew something about\nit, including the fact that there was a good possibility that he himself was a\ncarrier. Mr. Johnson also knew that the trait is fairly common among African\nAmericans, about one in twelve of them being a carrier, so that there was a\ngood chance his fiancée was a carrier too. Ms. Sanford knows of no sickle\ncell disease in her immediate family, but she is in a racial group with a rela-\ntively high rate of carriers.\nMr. Johnson understands that, if both he and his future wife are carri-\ners, they will face additional choices. Prenatal diagnosis is now available\nthat will accurately determine if a fetus has sickle cell disease. The only\nintervention other than counseling available at that point, however, is the\ntermination of the pregnancy. Their other option would be to continue\nthe pregnancy until delivery, at which time routine testing will determine\nthe sickle cell status. If the infant has the disease (i.e., two copies of the\ngene), treatment regimens are now considered sufficiently effective that\nidentification of infants with the disease is mandated. For example, infec-\ntions need to be suppressed using antibiotics.\nThus, two prospective parents who know they both are carriers have\nfour options: they can risk a 25 percent chance of having a child with the\ndisease itself with each pregnancy, living with the attendant anxiety; they\ncan undergo prenatal diagnosis and abort affected fetuses; they can resort\nto artificial insemination with a noncarrier donor; or they can forgo child-\nbearing altogether, perhaps adopting if the short supply of adoptable\nbabies permits.\nMr. Johnson found each of these alternatives infuriatingly unaccept-\nable. He feared that the offer of premarital screening of African American\nfor the sickle cell trait, which is not a clinical condition and about which\nnothing can be done, was just another government attempt to cripple black\nreproductive capability. In the context of black history, he viewed it as an\nattempt by white society to control his fecundity in the beneficent guise of\nproviding medical options. All of their options seemed to inhibit childbear-\ning either because they would limit births (abortion and forgoing children\naltogether) or because they were expensive (prenatal testing or artificial\ninsemination). The choices were all unattractive and would inhibit his and\nhis wife's normal family development. Since the information would pro-\nduce anxiety and would inhibit childbearing, he came to doubt that screen-\ning for carrier status was defensible. He was also annoyed that while the\nstate rushed in to mandate screening of newborns—screening that might\nsuggest that African Americans should have no children—it paid little at-\ntention to the need for counseling connected with screening that would\nhelp those identified as having a sickle cell trait to understand their situa-\ntion and the alternatives for having children. He was more disturbed that,\nwhile the state mandated testing, it did not mandate health insurance that\nwould be necessary to cover the costs of intervention if their child turned\nout to have sickle cell.\nMs. Sanford did not feel so strongly, but she agreed that there was a\ndanger whenever the state mandated screening for a disease that primar-\nily affected African American families.",

For couples who have had a CF child in the past and are worried\nabout having another, physicians could offer standard IVF protocol with\nthe following additional steps: the sample used to infer genetic composi-\ntion includes polar bodies removed on day one after fertilization and one or\ntwo blastomeres on day three of cleavage-stage embryo development (the\nsix- to eight-cell stage). The embryos that do not have the defect would be\nimplanted in the mother’s womb, ensuring that their child or children would\nnot have the gene nor be able to pass the gene on to their children.\nDr. Thomas Sobeira, a member of the ethics committee, had deep con-\ncerns about this proposal for “embryo biopsy.” He was concerned about how\naccurate the test was and the potential for misdiagnosis. Even though the\nprevention of CF seemed an admirable goal, he was also concerned about\nopening the door to separating fetuses we wish to develop from those we\nwish to discontinue. In addition, a child with CF is not doomed to death in\n- infancy. In 2009, the median predicted age of survival for CF patients was in\nthe mid-30s, and there is no intellectual or behavioral impairment. Gene\ntherapy offers great promise for treatment. In the meantime, however, the\nchild is likely to be chronically ill and require repeated hospitalizations.",

She had\nhad two previous brain operations, the most recent of which involved the\nremoval of her entire right temporal lobe. She had also undergone three\nrounds of chemotherapy, radiation treatment, and an experimental mono-\nclonal antibody treatment. All failed to improve her situation. Her doctors\ngave her just weeks to live.\nDr. Ivor Royston of the San Diego Regional Cancer Center asked the NIH\nRecombinant DNA Advisory Committee for a “compassionate waiver” that\nwould allow him to treat this woman with an unapproved, experimental gene\ntherapy. A compassionate use waiver would permit the use of an experimen-\ntal agent outside the normal research protocol and approval process.\nDr. Royston's plan was to inject the woman with her own cells altered\ngenetically to contain interleukin 2 in an attempt to stimulate the woman's\nimmune response to the cancer. This would require that the woman be in-\njected with the cells in progressively larger doses every two weeks.\nAt the time of the proposal to treat this woman, the United States gov-\nernment had a Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC), which had to\nreview and approve all therapeutic use of gene therapy involving recombi-\nnation of genetic DNA. It had not reviewed this procedure.\nRoyston and the woman's husband had obtained a review from the Food\nand Drug Administration. It concluded that the therapy was, in all likeli-\nhood, not harmful. There was, however, no evidence that the therapy would\nbe effective. It had not been proven effective on animals and had never\nbefore been attempted in humans. :\nIn an ideal world in which a patient had time to wait for the orderly de-\nvelopment of a new drug or biological product, a patient would wait for test-\ning in nonhuman animals as well as humans. This woman did not have that\ntime to wait.\nDr. Bernadine Healy, then the Director of the National Institutes of\nHealth, had the authority to make the final decision. She originally rejected\nthe request.\nThen Senator Tom Harkin of lowa requested that the NIH create a\nsystem whereby the RAC could expedite compassionate use hearings for\npatients dying of terminal diseases. Senator Harkin wrote to Healy request-\ning that she create guidelines for expedited hearings in special cases.\nDr. Healy denied Senator Harkin’s request, stating that there was simply\nnot enough information available on this therapy to justify its use, even as\na compassionate exemption. She also stated that since many patients would\nqualify for this consideration, it would be impossible to decide which should\nbe granted waivers. Healy later reversed her decision citing the woman’s\nshort life expectancy.\nThis reversal prompted much speculation and anger among members\nof the RAC who were not consulted before Healy ultimately granted the\nexemption. Members of the RAC expressed concern that such a precedent,\ninvolving the premature use of experimental therapies, was potentially\ndangerous. The Committee members speculated about Senator Harkin’'s\nrole in the decision, noting that he heads the Senate subcommittee on ap-\npropriations, which allocates funds for the NIH. Harkin was initially made\naware of the woman's plight by her husband, whose sister had worked on\nHarkin's successful senatorial campaign.",

She had been seeing psychiatrist Gilbert DeVita now for a month,\nattempting to resolve intense feelings of guilt related to her persistent sui-\ncidal thoughts. She acknowledged to Dr. DeVita that for the past two years\nshe had had thoughts of ending her life. She had developed deep feelings\nthat included her more and more firm resolve to commit suicide, but si-\nmultaneously felt very guilty that she would be abandoning her respon-\nsibilities to her family and her community were she to do so.\nDr. DeVita had learned over the course of the four sessions he had\nhad with her that she was married to a Caucasian American with a history\nof alcoholism and abuse of his wife. Most of the abuse was mental. He criti-\ncized her constantly, complaining about the way she kept house and prepared\nmeals. Dr. DeVita had gotten her to reveal that, on at least two occasions,\nhe had struck her; once, a year ago, it had resulted in a trip to the hospital\nemergency room. That was the most recent physical attack that Dr. DeVita\nwas able to elicit from Ms. Wong.\nOver the years Ms. Wong had studied the history of Chinese thought\nand the culture of her parents who had immigrated from China when\nMs. Wong was a child. This Chinese cultural history, with its Confucian\ninfluences, was the closest thing Ms. Wong had to a religion. From it she\nhad come to understand that those in her heritage had sometimes chosen\nsuicide as a way to end a difficult life situation. She had decided that\nher marriage was hopeless and that ending her life was her way out. At\nthe same time, from her American culture she had absorbed the idea that\nsuicide was immoral and was in her words, “running away from the\nproblem.”\nDr. DeVita sympathized with Ms. Wong's plight, but had real doubts\nabout the wisdom of her chosen course. He was in a difficult position if\nshe was asking him to help her overcome her guilt in order to free herself\nfrom the constraints that would help her pursue the course she had chosen.\nAt the same time, he was not sure what his role should be. He knew that\nspousal abuse could be reported, but Ms. Wong pleaded that he not dis-\nclose those problems. The physical aspects of the abuse had ceased, at\nleast for the time being, and the mental cruelty was, in her view, not some-\nthing she wanted to address. Dr. DeVita offered to begin a course of therapy\nto overcome what he took to be a depression related to her feeling of hope-\nlessness in her marriage. She asked some questions, as if she were inter-\nested in that approach, but then quickly said that that was not what she\nwanted.",

He has been employed at the\nsame job as a professional accountant for three decades and plans on retir-\ning within the next year. He is in good health except that he is 5’9” tall and\nweighs 240 pounds. That makes his body mass index (BMI) 35.4 and makes\nhim obese according to the National Institutes of Health. According to the\nnewly revised American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical\nManual 5 (DSM-5) he has the disease of obesity.\nHe sees his internist, Dr. McCubbin, at his health maintenance organi-\nzation (HMO) yearly, and once again this year Dr. McCubbin points out his\nweight and urges him to follow a better diet and get more exercise. Other\nthan his obesity, Mr. Braddock is healthy. His lipids and blood pressure are\nwithin the normal range. (He is on a statin, which helps with the lipids.) He\nhas gout, but no other significant medical issues. He has never smoked and\nwalks a mile a day at least five days a week.\nMr. Braddock's weight has been stable for over 20 years. The continual\nexpressions of concern about his weight from his internist and his wife have\nled him to pay attention to the literature on obesity. He knows that higher\nBMI levels generally correlate with mortality and morbidity risks. He found\na publication referring to the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) for the year 2000 that estimated 111,909 excess deaths\nfrom obesity (BMI greater than 30). On the other hand, he found tremen-\ndous variation in the articles he had read. Particularly with older patients,\nthe correlations seem variable. For example, in one article he read, for\nblack subjects, death risk actually was lower for people in the BMI range\nof 25-28 than it was for those in the 23.5-24.9 range. Moreover, even\nthough death risk increased at higher BMI ranges, even in the highest\ngroup the difference was not statistically significant. Thus, even though\nthere were detrimental effects at the highest BMI ranges, the time lost\nfrom obesity was small for older persons, measured in months or, at\nmost, a year or two, and for older blacks higher BMI actually produced a\ngain in years of life.\nMr. Braddock’s conclusion was that his obesity was a real, but proba-\nbly a small risk. Given his generally good health, his avoidance of smok-\ning, and the rather small and variable effects on longevity for older people,\nhe decided that the mortality gain from getting his weight down was prob-\nably real, but small. He understood the morbidity risks—diabetes, joint\nproblems, and so forth—but was not convinced that the effort to reduce\nhis risk was worth it. He gained great pleasure out of eating and enjoyed\nregular weekend gatherings with his grown son and daughters and their\nfamilies for elaborate traditional meals or barbecues. In addition, he found\nexercise beyond his regular walking terribly boring and, in a strange way,\na kind of offensive social conformity.",

For two years the patient had experienced increasing trouble\nwith the technical aspects of his work. More recently he had been talking\nabout his brother, George, as if he were alive although he had died six\nyears earlier. He identified his own age as 48 and the year as \"1994... er,\nno, 2000.” Examination revealed that the patient walked with a wide-based\ngait, a standard sign of brain pathology, and had a decreased cerebral\nfunction but was otherwise normal. The patient had no difficulty with\nsimple coin problems and could repeat six digits.\nPleading pressing business, the patient declined hospitalization to deter-\nmine the cause of his decreasing cerebral function. His wife tried to persuade\nhim to enter the hospital, but when the physician suggested that she might\nassume guardianship of her husband through court action, she declined.\nSix months later, the patient’s condition had worsened. Through the\nurging of the county agent, the patient had leased most of his farmland to\nhis neighbors and now did no farm work. His gait had become so wide-\nbased that acquaintances mistakenly thought him inebriated. He urinated\nin his pants about once a week but seemed not to care. He sat watching\ntelevision all day but paid no attention to the program content.\nA medical examination showed an apparently alert man without\nspeech difficulty but with considerable mental deterioration. This time the\npatient gave his age as 38, the year as 1973, the president as Clinton, and\nthe location as a drugstore in his home town. He failed to recognize the\nname George W. Bush, but upon hearing the name Dick Cheney, he sponta-\nneously volunteered an opinion on the war in Iraq. The patient could not\nsubtract 20 cents from a dollar but could name the number of nickels in a\nquarter. He could recite the months of the year and could, upon request\nfrom his wife, give fairly long quotations from the Bible.\nThe resident and the attending physician urged hospitalization. They\ntold the patient that they could evaluate him for treatable causes of\nmental deterioration and memory deficit. In view of his wide-based gait\nand urinary incontinence in association with dementia, it was likely he\nhad occult hydrocephalus. It was explained to the couple that this disorder\ncauses decreased mental abilities by interference with the absorption of\ncerebrospinal fluid. The mental deterioration in such patients is partially\nreversible, as in his case at the present time, or completely reversible, as\nwas his case six months ago when first seen. The treatment was to place a\nplastic tube through the skull to drain the cerebrospinal fluid from the\nbrain to the vascular system, which was explained to the patient with dia-\ngrams. The patient immediately rejected the operation, summarizing his\nthoughts with the words, “Ain't nobody gonna cut on my head.”\nThe patient's wife again attempted to persuade the patient to accept\nhospitalization and, if tests confirmed the clinical impression, an opera-\ntion. The attending physician argued to the wife that the patient did not\nhave the mental competence to decide his own fate and that the wife should\nbecome the patient's legal guardian through court action and force his\nhospitalization. The wife politely but vigorously rejected this course of\naction, pointing out that, in her family, the husband made all important\ndecisions. In addition, she expressed horror at forcing this kind of invasive\nprocedure on her husband.\nThe resident and the attending physician differed in opinions at this\npoint. The resident thought the patient should be followed in the outpatient\nclinic until he perhaps changed his mind. The resident pointed out that\nthough the patient had decreased mental abilities, he still retained enough\nintelligence to decide his own fate. The attending physician wished for\ncourt action to make the patient the ward of one of his relatives or, if neces-\nsary, the temporary ward of the hospital and forcing hospitalization and\ntherapy.",

Through the Internet he met Sandi Sabloff, who needed a kidney\ntransplant. One of her kidneys had failed completely and the second was\nfailing as well. Legal complications prevented him from making the gift in\nAustralia so he traveled to Toronto, Canada.\nPrior to coming to Canada, he had been interviewed by telephone by a\ncommittee. It included a psychiatrist, a social worker, and a bioethicist. On\nMarch 19, 2007, he arrived at Toronto General Hospital where the organ\nprocurement was planned. He had further evaluation including meetings\nwith the committee and medical compatibility testing. Following the\nscreening, the hospital sent a letter to Ms. Sabloff indicating the transplant\nwould occur on April 30.\nSome days later, the hospital began reassessing its decision.\nMr. Falkingham’s mother and stepfather, Kate and Nick Croft, had urged\nthe hospital to review the case further. They claimed he had been unduly\npressured into donating by the religious group, the Jesus Christians. It is a\ngroup that believes it should act on its Christian faith by donating a kidney\nto a stranger as an act of kindness. About half of the thirty members of the\ngroup have donated, including its leader David McKay who had donated\none of his kidneys at the Mayo Clinic in 2003.\nMr. Falkingham’s stepfather was quoted by the National Post newspa-\nper as saying, “I’m certain that the pressure to donate a kidney is one of the\nmany pressures involved in being a member of this group. ... I would say it’s\na cult. I would say it's a sect. I would say it’s a madness.” They claimed that\nthe group coerced members into giving kidneys as a way of gaining public-\nity. Meanwhile, the group claims it is their way of expressing spiritual devo-\ntion and Christian charity. Mr. Falkingham said he was sent to a forensic\npsychiatrist with a specialty related to brainwashing and undue influence.\nAfter some five weeks of waiting, the hospital announced that it was can-\nceling the operation. Robert Bell, the CEO of University Health Network, the\nparent of Toronto General, was quoted by the Toronto-based Globe and Mail\nnewspaper as saying, “We need to make sure the [donor] has informed con-\nsent for what this is all about, without any evidence of coercion and without\nany evidence of value consideration being given to the donation of the tissue.”",

        "case": "Case 12-5\nA Kidney to Turn a Life Around\nAdam Taylor, age 33, had lived a tough life. He started drinking in high\nschool and was an alcoholic by the time he was 21. His marriage failed\nafter two years. His wife won custody of his two children and now will not\nlet him see them. He had been employed with various construction firms,\nbut his alcoholism had cost him those well-paying jobs.\nAfter a decade lost in the haze of drugs and alcohol, he entered a\ntreatment program at age 31. It began with a four-week inpatient program\nfollowed by intensive group, outpatient therapy. He had now been sober\nfor eighteen months. He had joined the church of his girlfriend and was\nworking steadily at a local fast-food restaurant. His life was beginning to\nimprove.\nMr. Taylor read in the local newspaper that the organ procurement\norganization (OPO) was accepting, on a trial basis, people who wanted\nto altruistically donate a kidney to a stranger. No one was actively re-\ncruited for the program, but the OPO would accept donor-initiated re-\nquests. Following a rigorous work-up, those who passed the medical\nand psychiatric screen would enter a hospital in the area to have a\nkidney removed. Those who called the OPO were told that the removal\nof the kidney was a major operation that would require about a week's\nhospitalization followed by a month's recovery. Healthy people should\nbe able to function well for the rest of their lives with one kidney. The\nprocedure is the same one now used routinely by family members who\ndonate a kidney to a loved one. The only difference in the case of an\naltruistic donor to a stranger is that the kidney, once procured, would be\nallocated according to the standard algorithm for organs procured from\nnewly deceased donors.\nMr. Taylor passed the medical screen. There was no sign of infectious\ndisease related to his history of drug use. His psychiatric evaluation was\nconducted by Ann Buchanan, who was under contract with the OPO for\nsuch evaluations. She had to certify that the potential donor was mentally\nable to give an adequate consent to the donation and was not under undue\ninfluence. Dr. Buchanan spent more than the usual amount of time with\nMr. Taylor because of his medical and lifestyle history. She came to believe\nthat Mr. Taylor wished to donate a kidney as a symbol that he was leading\na new life, that he had turned his life around. No doubt, he had serious\nproblems in the past, but she could find no mental issues except for the\nhistorical problems. Her problem was whether she should certify that he\nwas mentally fit to consent to donation when she recognized that this was\nhis way of symbolizing a life change.",

        "case": "Case 12-8\nThe Interrogation of Guantanamo Prisoner Mohammed al-Qahtani\nIn August 2001, Mohammed al-Qahtani arrived in the Orlando Florida\nAirport, allegedly to join the group of men who would go on to hijack the\nplanes on September 11. However, an observant interviewer was suspicious\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s story and deported him back to Saudi Arabia. During\nthe American invasion of Afghanistan in 2002, American soldiers captured\nMr. al-Qahtani and transferred him to the detention center at Guantanamo\nBay. Once authorities realized that he may have been directly involved\nwith the 9/11 hijackers, he was labeled a “high-value detainee.”\nIn 2002, former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld authorized\nextraordinary interrogation techniques for high-value detainees. He also\nmandated that these interrogations be subject to oversight by health\nprofessionals. To implement these policies, special teams were created to\nwork on interrogations—they were called Behavioral Science Consultation\nTeams (BSCTs). These teams were headed by a psychologist or psychiatrist.\nTheir job was not simply to monitor interrogations but to employ their\nknowledge of human psychology to better exploit a prisoner's psychological\nand cultural vulnerabilities for the purposes of extracting information.\nUnder the new interrogation guidelines, Mr. al-Qahtani was interro-\ngated using very aggressive and controversial techniques. These included\nbeing deprived of sleep for more than a week at a time, having hypothermia\ninduced by air conditioning, being exposed to barking, growling dogs to\nwhich the prisoner had a phobia, being forced to take many bags of intra-\nvenous fluid and then to urinate on himself, and being forced to violate\nvarious Islamic religious obligations and prohibitions.\nThroughout Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation, he was monitored daily\nby physicians. Although the physicians were officially not involved in the\ninterrogation itself but only in ensuring the prisoners continued health,\nthey were in frequent contact with the prisoner during the ongoing interro-\ngation. They helped to facilitate these tactics by approving the continua-\ntion of interrogation immediately after Mr. al-Qahtani had been treated\nfor severe hypothermia. On at least one occasion a medical professional\nwas involved in the administration of large amounts of intravenous fluid\nto the prisoner against his will for the purpose of causing discomfort and\nhumiliation.\nThe involvement of the BSCT psychologist in the interrogation tactics\nwas even more extensive. An army investigation revealed that the BSCT\npsychologist witnessed and possibly encouraged the use of growling and\nbarking dogs to terrify the prisoner. A log that details a two-month period\nof Mr. al-Qahtani’s interrogation revealed that a BSCT psychologist later\nidentified as Major John Leso was present during the interrogation ses-\nsions. The log notes two instances in which Major Leso directly encour-\naged controversial psychological tactics. In the first instance, Major Leso\nsuggested that the prisoner be placed in a swivel chair so that he could be\nprevented from focusing his eyes on one spot. In the second instance, after\ndays of allowing the prisoner no sleep other than brief naps while shackled\nto the interrogation chair, Mr. al-Qahtani requested that he be allowed to\nsleep in a room other than the interrogation room. When interrogators\nconsulted Major Leso, he said that \"the detainee was only trying to run\nan approach on the control and gain sympathy.”\nIn addition to these two instances of the psychologist’s encouragement\nof controversial tactics, there is evidence of numerous other ways in which\nthe BSCT may have advised interrogators on how to harmfully manipulate\nthe prisoner's emotions and beliefs. Interrogators systematically violated\nvarious Islamic prohibitions. For example, a female interrogator would se-\nductively touch the prisoner. The interrogators disrespectfully handled the\nQuran. They shaved the prisoner's head and beard and repeatedly refused\nto allow him to pray. Further, they employed dehumanizing techniques\nsuch as leashing the prisoner like a dog and making him bark and remark-\ning that the prisoner's life was worse than that of the rats inhabiting the\ncompound.",

She feels for-\ntunate to have gotten the job, because the hospital is nationally known and\nthe occupational therapy program is well established. She is involved in\ncare conferences on all of the patients. Her input is valued because of her\nhonesty and insight into the problems of her adolescent patients.\nAt a unit meeting, the chief psychiatrist informs the team that he is going\nto begin using a new type of behavior modification with his patients whose\nbehavior had been diagnosed as an “adjustment disorder with mixed distur-\nbance of emotions and conduct.” He is vague as to the exact type of treatment\nhe plans to use, but he has a solid reputation in the community and the\nhospital, hence the rest of the staff supports him. He admits the majority of\ninpatients on the unit and is therefore quite valuable to the hospital.\nTwo weeks later, Ms. Barthells sits in a care conference on a new ado-\nlescent male patient admitted to the facility by a foster parent. The nurse\nreads the case history. The patient has a history of running away from\nfoster homes, extended absences from school, possible drug use, and a vio-\nlent temper. He is 14 years old.

The psychia-\ntrist says, “I have been withholding food and water from him and intend to\ncontinue with this behavior modification until he is willing to comply with\nthe rules and regulations on the unit.”\nMs. Barthells is not sure if she heard him correctly. She asks for clarifi-\ncation. The psychiatrist replies, “This is a new type of behavior modifica-\ntion therapy that has proved quite effective for recalcitrant youths.

        "case": "He ™ Case 13-1\nWarning: Premarital Sex May Be Dangerous to Your Health\nThe British General Medical Council's Disciplinary Committee was\ncharged in 1971 with the task of deciding whether or not a physician was\nguilty of “serious professional misconduct,” whereupon it made the following\nreport: ‘\nThe Committee next inquired into the charge against Dr. Robert John Denis\nBrowne of Birmingham, that he had disclosed to the father of a Miss X that an\noral contraceptive had been prescribed for her by the Birmingham Brook Ad-\nvisory Centre, notwithstanding that he had been given the information in\nconfidence by the Centre and that he had neither sought nor received her per-\nmission to make the disclosure.\nThe complainant was the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre, which was\nrepresented by Mr. G. 8. Jonas, Solicitor. ...\nMr. Jonas said that it was only after the most anxious thought and de-\nliberation, including meetings with Dr. Browne, that the matter had been\nbrought before the Disciplinary Committee. Dr. Browne had practiced in\nBirmingham since 1941 and was highly regarded by his patients. Mr. Jonas\nalleged that, in his capacity as a doctor, he had received confidential infor-\nmation about one of his patients and quite deliberately and, for no valid\nmedical reason, had betrayed that confidence by telling the patient's father\nwhat he had been told.\nAt the time Miss X called at the center she was just over 16, a highly\nintelligent, attractive, and mature young woman. Mr. Jonas told the Com-\nmittee that when an oral contraceptive was prescribed, it was the practice\nof the clinic to inform the family doctor unless the patient specifically for-\nbade it. In this instance, Miss X agreed to her doctor being informed.\nDr. Browne had informed the girl's father that she was “on the pill.” No\neffort had been made by Dr. Browne to discuss the matter with his patient,\nand the patient's consent to this disclosure was neither sought nor ob-\ntained. Dr. Browne had said he would have to do the same again in every\ncase that came to his notice, and the only situation he could see was that\nthe center should never again inform him if one of his patients came to see\nthem. He had said it was all very well for the clinic prescribing the pill but,\nif anything went wrong, he would have to deal with the problem.\nThe burden of the complaint was that the doctor let his views interfere with the\nobjectivity demanded of a professional man.\nThe press had said the issue was important for doctors, and also to\npatients, but in Mr. Jonas’s submission it was primarily important to pa-\ntients, whose confidence must be kept. The confidence was always with the\npatient, it was never that of the doctor.\n[A clinic physician testified that he] felt it important that the general\npractitioner should be informed so that if there were any side effect the\ndoctor would have knowledge that the girl was taking oral contraceptives.\nMr. R. Alexander, Counsel for Dr. Browne submitted that this was not, in\nany sense, a test case. The sole issue was whether this respected doctor\nhad been guilty of the offense of serious professional misconduct. There\nwere three issues: first, could one doctor unilaterally impose a confidence\non another, and by unilaterally he meant could he do so without seeking the\nconsent of the other doctor; second, what was the position with regard to the\nduty or right of a doctor to tell the parents of a child who had not reached\nthe age of majority of the medical treatment that child was receiving; and\nthe third issue was that medical confidence existed for the benefit of the\npatient. If the doctor believed it to be in the interests of the patient to reveal\nthe confidence to a third party, then he was entitled to do so.\nDr. Browne, in evidence, said that he was 63 years of age and was mar-\nried with three children, including a girl of 18. He had qualified in 1941 and\nhad been in practice in Birmingham for about thirty years. The parents of\nthe girl had been his patients for many years, and he had been their doctor\nat the time of her birth. She had been his patient all her life. She still was\nhis patient, and he had seen her professionally quite recently.\nWhen he had received the letter from the Brook Centre, it sounded an\nalarm bell in his mind. He was concerned that a girl only just 16 had been\nplaced on a contraceptive pill without prior knowledge or consultation with\nthe family doctor. It was a stable family, with the daughter living at home.\nHe had discussed the matter, which gave him great anxiety, with profes-\nsional colleagues. He tried to get an estimate of the situation without men-\ntioning anyone’s name and considered the problem carefully.\nThe girl's father happened to come to the surgery shortly after this, and\nhe asked him if his daughter was getting married. The father said that she\nwas not, but that she had a steady boyfriend and was still at school.\nDr. Browne said he thought hard and then made up his mind—bearing in\nmind the girl's best interests, and for that reason solely—and handed the\nfather a copy of the letter from the Centre and explained what it meant.\nDr. Browne said that he had had two motives in informing the parents.\nOne was the physical hazards of the pill, and second were the moral and\npsychological hazards. He was not standing in judgment, but with his\nknowledge of the home background, and knowing the parents were sym-\npathetic and kindly and could handle the situation with care and tact, he\nconsidered that parents were the best people to counsel her in their own\nway. He also saw psychological hazards, for if she were keeping a secret\nshe might have a sense of guilt, which could have a harmful effect on her\nemotionally. He pointed out that it would have been difficult for him to con-\ntact the girl without arousing parental suspicion. The episode did not\nappear to have impaired his relationship with Miss X.\nIn reply to cross-examination by Mr. Jonas, Dr. Browne said that his in-\nterests were primarily for the patient and for her alone. He had no other inter-\nest except what was best for her. His patient was being placed on a dangerous\ndrug, without his prior knowledge or consent, with all the hazards that might\ninvolve—and steroid drugs were a particular hazard.\nDr. Walter Woolley, ex-Chairman of the Central Ethical Committee of\nthe British Medical Association, told the Committee he had been a family\ndoctor since 1933. In his view, a third party could not fetter the right of the\ndoctor—for instance, by a letter such as the one from the Brook Centre—to\nexercise his own judgment.\nDame Amis Gillie said that she had had thirty-eight years’ experi-\nence in general practice, and, in her view, professional secrecy existed in\nthe interest of the patient. She considered that there could be situations in\nwhich the benefit of the patient meant that a confidence must be dis-\nclosed. Every case should be judged on its own merits by the practitioner\ninvolved.\nThe final witness was Dr. J. C. Cameron, Chairman of the General\nMedical Services Committee of the British Medical Association (BMA). He\nhad been in general practice for many years and believed that a long-\nstanding knowledge of a patient was of great advantage in forming an as-\nsessment of a situation. He would have preferred that, if possible, the girl's\nconsent should have been sought prior to the disclosure to her parents, but\nthere might be circumstances in which this was impracticable.\nAfter consideration in camera the President said:\nThe Committee has found [that it has been] proved that the information you\nreceived from the Birmingham Brook Advisory Centre was in confidence, and\nthat you had neither sought nor received the patient's permission to make the\ndisclosure; but in the particular circumstances of this case... the Committee\ndo not regard your action in disclosing the information referred to in the\ncharge as improper. The Committee therefore has not found that the whole of\nthe facts alleged in the charge, including the word ‘improperly,’ have been\nproved. It has accordingly recorded a finding that you are not guilty of serious\nprofessional misconduct.",

She did not\nreciprocate that interest, which led to Mr. Poddar’s depression. He eventu-\nally sought the assistance of the Dr. Lawrence Moore, a psychologist at the\nCowell Memorial Hospital at the university. Mr. Poddar confided his inten-\ntion to kill Tatiana.”!\nThat Dr. Moore took the threat seriously is confirmed by his notifying\nthe campus police, who briefly detained Mr. Poddar but soon released him\nwhen he appeared rational to them. Dr. Moore's supervisor, Dr. Harvey\nPowelson, directed that no further action be taken. Ms. Tarasoff was out of\nthe country visiting an aunt in Brazil. Neither Ms. Tarasoff nor her parents\nwere warned of the threat. When the young woman returned Mr. Poddar\nbegan stalking her and eventually stabbed her to death.\nMs. Tarasoff's parents sued Dr. Moore, Dr. Powelson, the campus police,\nand the university, alleging that they failed to warn Tatiana or her parents\nand failed to see that Mr. Poddar was confined.\nMany psychiatrists, psychologists, and police came to the defense of\ntheir colleagues in this case. Their professional associations entered the\ncase on their behalf. Those focusing on the health professional's duty\nargued that danger to others is not accurately predictable, but even if it\nwere, the duty of the psychologist or psychiatrist in this case is to the pa-\ntient, not to third parties. Furthermore, they contended that a policy requir-\ning a duty to warn would dissuade potential patients from seeking\nprofessional assistance, thus eliminating a potential benefit to the one in\ndanger.\nThose supporting the parents argued that the duty of a professional\ncannot be limited to the patient when the health professional has knowl-\nedge of a serious and credible threat of grave bodily harm.\nThe police were found according to state law to be immune from liabil-\nity and had no duty to warn. The medical personnel were immune from\nfailing to confine Mr. Poddar but concluded they could face charges of fail-\nure to warn. The court concluded:\nWhen a therapist determines, or pursuant to the standards of his profes-\nsion should determine, that his patient presents a serious danger of vio-\nlence to another, he incurs an obligation to use reasonable care to protect\nthe intended victim against such danger. The discharge of this duty may\nrequire the therapist to take one or more of various steps, depending upon\nthe nature of the case. Thus it may call for him to warn the intended victim\nor others likely to apprise the victim of the danger, to notify the police,\nor to take whatever others steps are reasonably necessary under the\ncircumstances.”\nWhile a court case determines only what the law in that jurisdiction\nrequires, it is also important to ask what was ethically appropriate and\nwhether the legal conclusion is, in fact, an appropriate resolution or\nwhether the law should be changed.",

The patient had been subdued on the corner of Rose and Belmont\nStreets. He claimed that the Nazis were infiltrating the Political Science De-\npartment of the university where he was a graduate student. The patient\nhad, that afternoon, assaulted three innocent passersby, whom he accused\nof being part of the conspiracy. Mr. Gorly was scheduled to take his doc-\ntoral examination the coming Tuesday. He had been up for three consecu-\ntive nights reading modern European political history, cramming for one of\nhis exams. After completing the exams and writing his dissertation, the\npatient was planning on a career in the foreign service. His professors had\nalways thought of him as a bit strange but considered him one of the bright\nyoung scholars in the department. They had tried to persuade him to go into\nteaching, but he was an activist; he still had faith that hard-working, intel-\nligent foreign service officers could do something to change American for-\neign policy.\nHis parents brought him to the Brooklyn Psychiatric Clinic late that eve-\nning. The diagnosis was an acute paranoid schizophrenic break. Dr. Andrew\nLyons, the psychiatrist on call, understood the extreme pressure of the\nexams. He confided to the parents that he thought the prognosis was good.\nHopefully, a short stay as an inpatient would get their son through the crisis.\nThe doctor administered 20 mg Ziprasidone intramuscularly and made\nappropriate notations on the chart. The patient, who was still present, in-\nsisted on knowing what was being written. Dr. Lyons explained. The doctor\nthen picked up the Admission Form. Mr. Gorly insisted on seeing the form,\nand Dr. Lyons obligingly gave him a blank copy. It was a standardized,\ncomputerized form giving the patient's name, address, Social Security\nnumber, occupation, and psychiatric history. It also included religion, edu-\ncation, weekly family income, a “problem appraisal,” and, most signifi-\ncantly, the psychiatric diagnosis written as the code.\n“You mean you are going to fill out this entire form so my whole life can\nbe fed into a computer?” the patient asked. “Where does the duplicate copy\ngo?” he demanded.\n“To the Department of Mental Hygiene in the state capital,” was the reply.\n“Do you realize what this does to my foreign service career when this\nreaches the government computer?”\nDr. Lyons said he was sure that the records were treated with strict\nconfidence. The records were needed for statistical purposes only. Cer-\ntainly they would not be turned over to the foreign service.\n“And why do my name, address, and Social Security number go on the\nform if it is only for statistical purposes?” the patient asked. “You can't just\nsend my name in. It violates my right to confidentiality.”\n“The law says I have to send in the form. It is part of a multi-state infor-\nmation system for psychiatric patients,” was the reply.",

        "case": "Case 14-2\nPediatric Heart Procurement in Denver\nThe Pediatric Heart Transplant Team at Children’s Hospital, Denver, led by\nsurgeon Mark Boucek, was concerned about the shortage of infant hearts\nfor transplant. It developed a protocol for a clinical trial for the use of hearts\nprocured from newborns with conditions incompatible with life.® It pro-\ncured and transplanted three hearts. Decisions to withdraw life support on\ngrounds of futility were made by clinicians independent of the transplant\nteam and with the consent of the infants’ parents. After the deaths of the\ninfants, determined by cardiocirculatory criteria, the hearts were procured\n(referred to as “donation after death from cardiocirculatory causes”). They\nwere transplanted into three infants of compatible blood group who were\nin the highest priority status for heart transplant. Parents of the recipients\nwere given a choice of waiting for hearts procured from infants following\nconventional brain death or receiving these hearts.\nAlthough the protocol was potentially controversial because of risks to\nrecipients receiving hearts procured in a novel way, the major debate was\nover the question of whether the infants from whom the hearts were pro-\ncured were really dead at the time the hearts were removed.\nTwo issues were debated. First, no accepted peer-reviewed standard\nexisted for how long to wait after cessation of heart beat before pronouncing\ndeath in newborns. The Institute of Medicine's 2006 recommended stan-\ndard for adults was 5 minutes,’ but it is generally recognized that infants\ncannot be expected to react in the same way as adults. The Denver team\nwaited 3 minutes for its first case and 75 seconds for the second and third\ncases. They based their decision in the first case on a recommendation of\nthe ethics committee of the American College of Critical Care Medicine\nand the Society for Critical Care Medicine, published in 2001, that stated\n2 minutes of asystole for adults was sufficient.!° The latter two cases in\nwhich the wait time was 75 seconds was a position endorsed by the local\nethics committee. Critics argued that there was not adequate peer-reviewed\ndata to support the short wait time.”\nSecond, regardless of whether the waiting time had been sufficient,\nother critics raised the question of whether someone can be said to be dead\nby cardiocirculatory criteria if the heart, a critical part of the circulatory\nsystem, not only could function at some future time but actually did so. This\nwas evidenced by the fact that all three hearts functioned successfully in\nthe recipients. The Denver team argued that it does not matter if the hearts\nfunctioned in the future. The circulation in the donor infants was, in fact,\npermanently stopped. They no doubt would admit that the donor infants’\ncirculatory systems could have been restarted in those infants. Their claim\nwas that, as long as it did not actually start in those infants, they could be\ncalled dead.",

Joel Williams, a 25-year-old Caucasian male,\nhad succumbed to a gunshot wound to the head, apparently in retaliation\nfor a drug deal that had gone bad. Physicians at City Hospital had done all\nthey could to save his life but did not succeed. The family was now asking\nabout the possibility of donating his organs for transplant.\nA young, previously healthy person who suddenly receives a fatal\ngunshot wound is, in many ways, an ideal source of organs, but Williams\nhad a long history of intravenous (IV) drug abuse and evidence of bad\nheart valves probably related to his drug use. That meant that his heart\nor its valves would not be usable, but other organs were potentially of\nusable quality. Preliminary tests had shown good liver and kidney func-\ntion. Williams's mother wanted something good to come from his death,\nwhich she considered a terrible waste of what had once been a promis-\ning son.\nA history of IV drug abuse is a warning sign in transplantation. IV drug\nuse is one of the major sources of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\ninfection. Williams had screened negative for HIV, but there was some\nchance he had not seroconverted, that he was actually carrying a recently\nacquired HIV infection. Transplanting organs from an infected person\nposed a danger of transmission of HIV. Organs would be perfused to\nremove as much of Williams's blood as possible, but the virus could still be\npresent in the organs.\nAt one time, those with high-risk lifestyles including homosexual men\nand IV drug abusers were routinely disqualified as donors. Now, however,\nthousands were dying while on the waiting list for organs, and transplant\ncommunity professionals were questioning whether such organs should\nalways be discarded. The chance of such persons being infected was very\nlow, and a transplant might not transmit an infection. (Surgeons would\nnever intentionally transplant an organ from someone with known HIV in-\nfection, but screening for HIV was expensive, time-consuming, and not\ncompletely reliable.)\nThe problem was made more complicated by the fact that having HIV no\nlonger disqualifies one from being listed for transplant. People who need\norgans for reasons that may be unrelated to their HIV receive organs using\nthe standard allocation system. Ms. Weekley realized that she could offer\nMr. Williams's organs to those on the list who were already HIV-positive. This\nmight theoretically increase their risk by adding copies of the virus, possibly\nintroducing a new strain that could make the disease worse. On the other\nhand, some of these candidates on the list might be suffering significantly\nfor need of an organ—perhaps declining toward death. For kidneys, the wait\ncan be five years for a normal organ, a waiting time that could be unattract-\nive to potential recipients. It had even been suggested that those with HIV\nmight find solidarity with a donor who shares the disease or a risk of it.",

Soon it became clear that he would not recover and, in fact, was\nprogressing toward brain death.\nIn his possession at the time of the accident was an organ donor card\nindicating he would want to be a donor in the event of such an accident.\nHis family had been with him for three days and was now resigned to the\nfact that he would not recover. They initiated a conversation with the per-\nsonnel in the intensive care unit (ICU) that they knew he was an organ\ndonor. They stated clearly that they wanted something good to come from\nthis tragedy.\nThe patient had been tested for brain function. He presently did not meet\nbrain criteria for pronouncing death. The ICU attending physician explained\nthe options. They could maintain maximal life support (but acknowledged\nthat he would never recover consciousness). They could withdraw all life\nsupport and allow him to die. They expected that withdrawal of a ventilator\nwould probably result in death based on stoppage of heart function over the\ncourse of the next day or so.\nWhen the family again raised the question of organ donation, the ICU\nteam indicated that might be possible but were concerned that prolonged\ndeterioration would make donation after circulatory death (DCD) unlikely\nand that waiting for brain death criteria to be met might take so long that\nhis organs would no longer be usable.\nThe attending physician was aware of another possibility. They could\nmedicate him using vasopressor and heparin, not for Mr. Hendershott’s\nbenefit, but in order to preserve the organs for transplant. Their concern,\nhowever, was that these drugs could pose a slight risk of hastening the\ndeath. This might happen, for example, if Mr. Hendershott had a slow in-\nternal bleed that would be made worse by the heparin. They also expressed\nconcern of another kind. Maintaining Mr. Hendershott on a ventilator\ncould pose the possibility that he would stabilize and never progress to\nbrain death. He could remain in a coma and not die even if the ventilator\nwere disconnected. Since the physicians and family were in agreement\nthat it was not serving Mr. Hendershott's interest to preserve his life any\nlonger, the physician believed that stabilizing him in a coma that could\nlast for months or even years would actually be a bad outcome for him.\nSince the attending physician in the ICU believed his sole duty was to\nwork for Mr. Hendershott's interest and not to promote the agenda of the\ntransplant team, he felt that he could, in good conscience, neither admin-\nister vasopressors and heparin, which could count as actively killing the\npatient, nor maintain the ventilator, which could inappropriately preserve\nhis life.\nThe family still insisted that Mr. Hendershott would want everything\ndone to make his organs transplantable, especially since he would not\nsuffer in any way from the drugs or the ventilator.",

The evidence is that an adult with\nnormal kidney function can do quite well with only one kidney.\nReceiving a living donor transplant would be a substantial advantage\nto Mrs. Goolsby.

        "case": "Case 14-9\nPatients with Alcohol Dependency and Their Rights\nto Livers for Transplant\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing, the national Organ Procurement\nand Transplant Network created by the U.S. Congress to run the transplant\nprogram of the United States, has an Ethics Committee that addresses.\npolicy questions having an ethical component. In the mid-1990s, the com-\nmittee took up the controversial question of whether a history of alcoholism\nshould come into play in allocating livers.\nLiver failure can result from many causes. Some patients have failing\nlivers as a result of an in-born condition called biliary atresia, a blockage\nin the liver that causes liver failure. Surely, neither the small children with\nthis condition nor their parents are in any way responsible for this type of\nliver failure.\nOther causes involve more problematic behaviors—exposure to toxic\nchemicals and abusable drugs. Those damaging their livers in this way\nmay have no advance knowledge of the risk. They may not even voluntarily\nchoose to be exposed.\nAlcohol consumption is a major cause of liver failure and the need for\ntransplant. It is notoriously difficult to determine the extent to which alco-\nholism involves a voluntary component. The issue debated in the UNOS\nEthics Committee was whether a history of alcoholism should play a role in\nallocating livers, and, if so, what role it should play.\nThe committee staked out four positions. Theoretically, one could have\na full and equal claim to a liver even if one were an active alcoholic. No one\non the committee took that position. Everyone agreed that there must be\nevidence that the alcoholic was to some degree recovered. Most thought\nthat at least six months of abstinence, preferably a year, was needed to\nshow a likelihood that the patient would not return to drinking and damage\nthe new liver the way he or she had damaged the original one.\nAt the other extreme, one could take the view that, since the choice to\nconsume alcohol damaged what was presumably a perfectly good liver,\nthe alcoholic patient had no entitlement to a liver for transplant at all. This\nview might lead to the conclusion that even if there were extra livers avail-\nable, the alcoholic patient did not deserve one. No one on the committee\ntook this view either.\nThe real debate was between two intermediate positions. One\ngroup, made up largely of surgeons, took the position that the role of\nUNOS was to produce as much benefit as possible from the limited\nsupply of livers available. The cause of the liver failure was not relevant;\nwhat mattered was whether a transplant would help. As long as there\nwas some assurance that the alcoholic was recovered, the question was\nwhether a transplant would help. The data showed that alcoholics do\nquite well with a transplant. Since that was the case, these committee\nmembers believed the alcoholics deserved full and equal consideration\nin the liver allocation. The history of the patient did not matter, only the\nprobability of benefit.\nThe other group on the committee was not convinced. They believed\nthat history was morally relevant. If some people had had the opportunity\nto have good livers and others had not, those who clearly had no role in\ntheir liver failure deserved more consideration than those who might have\nvoluntarily jeopardized theirs. This led to advocating some differential\nbetween those whose livers failed without their involvement, such as the\nbiliary atresia cases, and those that failed with a possible voluntary life-\nstyle choice involved.\nSince any justifiable organ allocation system will be multifactorial,\nthis final approach would not give an absolute priority to those without the\nhistory of alcoholism (or other voluntary health-risky behavior), but it would\njustify a small negative consideration, enough at least to break ties.\nSince livers are allocated on the point system called a MELD score,\nthis could be accomplished by subtracting one or more points from the\nscore if one had a history of alcoholism. The effect of this practice\nwould be minimal, giving only marginal negative weighting in com-\nparison to the risk of mortality, which is the main factor measured by the\nMELD score. The issue before the committee, then, was whether to propose\nsubtracting one or more points as an indicator that a history of voluntary\nbehavior leading to the need for a transplant was a fair way of allocating\norgans.",

She\nwas now in the intensive care unit of Children’s Hospital in Philadelphia.\nHer parents, Janet and Francis Murnaghan, claimed that if she did not\nreceive a set of donated lungs, she would die soon, possibly in a matter\nof weeks or sooner. They sued the federal government's Department of\nHealth and Human Services, claiming that the existing lung allocation\nsystem discriminated against children, violating the law that requires\nequitable allocation of organs. They sought, and soon got, a temporary\nrestraining order, requiring that their daughter be added to the adult\nlung allocation list.\nThe United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), the national agency\nunder contract to the federal government to manage the organ procurement\nand transplant system, was ordered to place Sarah on the adult lung allo-\ncation list as if she were an adult. UNOS has a long-standing policy of al-\nlocating adult lungs to adults with children only eligible for lungs from\nadults if no adult would take an available set. By contrast, children under\nage of 12 were first priority for lungs from children and second priority\n(before adults) for lungs procured from adolescents 12 to 18 years of age.\nThe reason for this arrangement was that adult lungs typically will not fit\nin the chest of a child without the poorly developed procedure of cutting\nthem down to size. Conversely, placing a small set of lungs from a child\ninto an adult was not ideal either. If Sarah were to be placed on the adult\nlist, she would retain her position on the pediatric list, thus giving her first\npriority for pediatric lungs plus normal priority for adult lungs, arguably\ngiving her an unfair advantage over others on the list. Adult lungs are al-\nlocated to adults using a lung allocation score (LAS), an empirical measure\nthat predicts the good done from a transplant based on expected survival\nwith and without a transplant. In order to list Sarah on the adult list, she\nwould need a LAS, but not all the data elements are available for children,\nand the use of the LAS for children has not been validated. Thus, critics\nclaimed there is no way to know exactly where Sarah should be placed on\nthe adult list. In response to the temporary restraining order, UNOS made\nan estimate of her LAS, filling in missing data where necessary.\nAt the time there were thirty children under age 12 waiting for lungs.\nTwenty sets of lungs had been procured during the 2012 calendar year. By\ncontrast there were about 1600 adults on the waiting list for lungs, and\nabout 1600 sets of adult lungs were procured in 2012. In addition, 144 lungs\nwere procured from adolescents in 2012, for which children have second\npriority and only 45 adolescents on the waiting list. This might imply that\nchildren actually had a slightly better chance of getting a set of lungs than\nadults. This is somewhat misleading, however, since priorities are as-\nsigned locally and the children’s and adolescent lungs will go to adults on\nthe waiting list locally before they go to children beyond the local area.\nHence, a small number of pediatric lungs is available for a small number\nof recipients. When one takes into account the necessity of blood-type\nmatching, the chances of a successful procurement of pediatric lungs of the\nright type are low whereas the large number of adult lungs for the large\nnumber of potential adult recipients makes a successful match easier to\nachieve. Even taking into account the scarcity of pediatric lungs, trans-\nplant professionals claimed that judicial intervention for Sarah Murnaghan\nwas not warranted and that judges or other public commentators were not\nin a position to consider all the complex variables that should go into an\nefficient and equitable lung allocation.\nSarah received a set of adult lungs soon after the temporary restrain-\ning order was granted. Those lungs, which apparently had to be cut to fit,\nwere rejected, leading to the allocation of a second set of lungs. The second\nset might not have been accepted for adults since they had been exposed\nto pneumonia infection, a significant risk in lung transplant when immuno-\nsuppression was necessary.",

He was a union-backed Democrat famed for his opposition to abortion\nthat led to a major Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey,\nwhich upheld provisions for parental notification in the case of minors and\na twenty-four-hour waiting period.”\nAlthough unknown to his constituents, Gov. Casey was diagnosed in\n1990 with a rare genetic disease, Appalachian familiar amyloidosis, in\nwhich production of amyloid was destroying his organs.” On June 14, 1993,\njust a few days after his disease was announced to the public, he received\na rare combined heart-liver transplant. There was dispute about whether\nhe received preferential treatment because of his public status as gover-\nnor. Some claim he was moved to the head of the waiting list. Others say he\nhad actually been on the waiting list for a year.\nThere were no clear rules for how allocation should be handled in the\ncase of such a rare combination of organs. It is generally agreed that when\nmore than one organ needs to be transplanted, they should be done simul-\ntaneously in order to avoid the trauma of two operations. Normally the\norgans would be obtained from the same donor, thus avoiding the addi-\ntional problem of exposure to two sets of foreign antigens. A case can be\nmade that if all the organs needed for a multiple-organ procedure are\navailable, they should go to someone who needs them both, at least if that\nperson is at the top of the waiting list for one of the organs.\nGiven that no clear rules were in place and that Gov. Casey needed a\nmultiple-organ transplant, there are reasons to move him to the head of the\nline independent of whether he was a prominent figure. The fact that he\nwas responsible for the welfare of all the citizens of Pennsylvania suggests\nan additional reason why he might be given special status. On the other\nhand, a multiple-organ transplant consumes two life-saving organs—a\nheart and a liver—both of which are so scarce that a person on the waiting\nlist will die because he or she will not receive them. Thus, two people will\ngo without transplant if the multiple-organ procedure is carried out.",

He suffered severe craniofacial\ntrauma for which he underwent removal of his left eye, removal of portions of\nthe left frontal lobe of his brain, and extensive cranial facial reconstruction.\nAt the time of the injury, he was diagnosed with organic brain disease that\ncauses him to suffer from severe migraines. Shortly thereafter, he became eli-\ngible for Medicare on account of his disability. Since the tornado, Mr. Horrigan\nhas required pain medication to manage the incapacitating headaches that\ncause seizures when left untreated. As a result, he has developed a tolerance\nto pain medications, causing most pain killers to be ineffective in managing\nhis acute migraines. For six years, Mr. Horrigan was using Actig, which is\nindicated by the FDA to treat breakthrough pain in cancer patients, to\nmanage his migraines and reduce the risk of seizing. Before the enactment\nof Medicare Part D, Mr. Horrigan received coverage of his Actiq prescription\nunder the state Medicaid program, TennCare. Initially, when Medicare Part D\nwas enacted and Mr. Horrigan was forced to enroll in a Medicare prescrip-\ntion drug plan, Humana covered his Actiq prescription. In October 2006,\nhowever, Mr. Horrigan was suddenly told by his pharmacist that Humana\nwas denying coverage. Mr. Horrigan did not receive notice that his coverage\nwould change, nor did he receive a transitional supply. Because he could not\nafford to pay for his Actiq prescription out of pocket, Mr. Horrigan’s prescrib-\ning physician, Dr. B, prescribed Fentora, which is also indicated by the FDA\nto treat breakthrough pain in cancer patients, as a replacement for the Actiq.\nFentora has also proven to successfully ease Mr. Horrigan’s pain. Initially,\nHumana provided coverage of Mr. Horrigan’s Fentora prescription, but in\nJanuary 2007 ended this coverage without prior notification or transition\nfill. Because his Fentora prescription costs approximately $1,500 a month,\nMr. Horrigan cannot afford to pay for it out of pocket. As a result, he visits\nthe emergency room (ER) on a biweekly basis so that he can receive the\nmedication at the hospital and avoid suffering from a seizure caused by\nhis extremely severe pain. Maximus Federal Services has denied his\nappeal for Part D coverage, and MRC is representing him in his appeal for\nreview by an administrative law judge.®",

        "case": "Case 16-1\nChemotherapy Risks: Is Going without Chemotherapy a Benefit?\nLaurie DeSoto, a 16-year-old girl who had recently been diagnosed with\nleukemia, came to the Pediatric Oncology Clinic with her mother to dis-\ncuss treatment options with Dr. Elizabeth Holmes, the oncologist who had\nassumed responsibility for her care when she was referred to the clinic.\nSeveral different chemotherapy regimens were under consideration, but\nDr. Holmes thought Laurie might be an ideal candidate for a research pro-\ntocol now under way at the clinic.\nThe protocol involved a standard four-drug regimen that had been\nused successfully for Laurie's type of leukemia for several years. The origi-\nnal regimen required patients to be on the drugs for five years. After consid-\nerable experience with this drug schedule, oncologists began to suspect\nthat the patients on it did not need to continue the drug for five years. The\ndata from long experience showed that three years was just as effective\nas judged by the percentage of patients who remained leukemia-free for\nfive years. The three-year regimen was now the standard. It was used\nwidely in oncology programs throughout the United States and elsewhere.\nOn the basis of that experience, Dr. Holmes and several colleagues\nbegan to wonder whether two years on the regimen might be as effective.\nThey realized that the adolescents taking the drug had to endure the side\neffects of the chemotherapy—the nausea, hair loss, and other effects—and\nwould appreciate having to stay on the regimen only two years rather\nthan three. On the other hand, if they were wrong, it would mean that some\npatients taken off the regimen after the shorter period might have recur-\nrence of their disease—a terrible, potentially fatal result.\nDr. Holmes had become the principal investigator of a new research\nprotocol that would randomize patients to receiving either the now-standard\nthree-year regimen or to an experimental group that received exactly the\nsame drug combination but for only two years. It was based on preliminary\nevidence from several clinical cases in which, for various reasons, patients\nhad stopped the treatment after two years and had not had recurrence of\ntheir leukemia. The protocol had to be approved by the hospital IRB, the\ngroup charged with protecting human subjects of research.\nOne of the criteria for approval was that the risks to subjects were\nreasonable and were justified by the potential benefits. The review board,\nafter considerable discussion, voted, by an eight-to-two margin, that the\nrisks were reasonably balanced. In other words, the majority of the board\nthought that the small risk of greater chance of recurrence of the leukemia\nwas justified by the benefits to the youngsters who received the shorter\ntwo-year regimen.\nDr. Holmes now decided to present the opportunity to enter this proto-\ncol to Laurie DeSoto and her mother. If they agreed to enter the study, Laurie\nwould be assigned randomly to either a standard three-year regimen or\nan experimental two-year treatment. Although subjects of research are\nnormally “blinded,” that is, kept ignorant of which treatment arm they\nenter, in this case that would not be possible since patients and physicians\nwould clearly know whether they were receiving the treatment for three\nyears or two. If the investigators and the IRB believe that the risks and\nbenefits are more or less equally balanced between the two groups, such\nrandomization is considered morally acceptable. When two treatment arms\nin a research protocol are perceived as being equally balanced in their\nrisks and benefits, the study is said to be in equipoise.'* Since Dr. Holmes\nand the IRB agreed that the risks were evenly balanced, they considered\nthe offer to be randomized morally justified.\nDr. Holmes presented the study to Laurie and her mother, including the\nfact that, if they agreed to enter the study, they would be randomly as-\nsigned to either three years or two years of treatment. After being given an\nopportunity to ask any questions, Mrs. DeSoto signed the consent form on\nbehalf of Laurie. Laurie, as a minor, could not give her own consent, but\nwas nevertheless asked to give her “assent,” which she gave. This amounts\nto approval even though it is not based on a level of understanding and\nvoluntariness that we would expect from an adult.\nDr. Holmes, having received documented consent, left the room and\nsoon returned with the news that Laurie had been randomly assigned to\nthe three-year arm, that is, the existing standard treatment. To her sur-\nprise, Laurie burst into tears. When asked, she explained she really\nwanted the two-year treatment course. She hated the thought of the side\neffects, especially the hair loss. She did not want to look strange for any\nlonger than necessary. She sobbed in her mother’s arms as Dr. Holmes\nlooked on.",

He had long been bothered by gastroeso-\nphogeal reflux disease (GERD). Reflux of gastric acid produces an unpleas-\nant sensation resulting from an improperly functioning sphincter between\nthe stomach and the esophagus that permits the upward flow of stomach\ncontents, especially gastric acid.\nMr. McBride's internist, William Arnold, had monitored the esophageal\nproblems for several years. Treatment had included antacids, histamine\nblockers (ranitidine or Zantac), and proton pump inhibitors including esome-\nprazole (Nexium). Dr. Arnold had noted increasing irritation of the lining of\nthe esophagus and the emergence of a condition known as Barrett's esopha-\ngus, in which some of its lining is modified with cells resembling intestinal\ncells replacing the normal tissue. This, in itself, is not harmful but is associ-\nated with the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The risk of the\ncancer is at least 30 percent higher in people with Barrett's esophagus and\nperhaps as much as double. The patient's condition had progressed to the\npoint that it now involved severe dysplasia.\nMx. McBride's risk of developing adenocarcinoma remained small, less\nthan | percent, but the consequences would be severe. Dr. Arnold referred\nMr. McBride to Dr. Rachel Herbert, the chair of laparoscopic surgery at the\ncity's most prestigious teaching hospital. Dr. Herbert agreed with Dr. Arnold's\ndiagnosis. When the condition worsened, she recommended removal of the\nportion of the esophagus that manifested the abnormal cells. This would\nreduce the risk of the cells becoming cancerous. This was a major opera-\ntion but should result in an elimination or reduction of the risks associated\nwith Barrett's esophagus. She explained the risks and benefits. The proce-\ndure would be done laparoscopically, that is, using instruments that could\nbe passed through small slits in the skin, thereby making the intervention\nmuch less invasive. Dr. Herbert was one of the country’s most experienced\nlaparoscropic surgeons, having pioneered the techniques for several lapa-\nroscopic procedures. —\nShe had one concern about the consent for the procedure. Although she\nwas a world-class laparoscopic surgeon, most of her experience was in in-\ntestinal procedures and in sterilization of women who wanted their tubes\ntied using the laparoscopic technique. She had only performed two previous\nesophageal procedures laparoscopically. Thus, although she was a leading\nsurgeon, she was relatively new at this particular procedure. She feared that\ntelling Mr. McBride this would alarm him and could even drive him to con-\nsider alternatives, such as getting the operation done at another hospital.\nShe was convinced this was not in Mr. McBride’s interest. Although other\nhospitals had surgeons who might be more experienced at the esophageal\nprocedure, she believed her extensive experience with other laparascopic\nprocedures and the high quality of her hospital made it better for Mr. McBride\nto have her do the operation. In reviewing the elements of an adequately in-\nformed consent, should Dr. Herbert explain her relative inexperience?",

When the medication they prescribed\ndid not resolve his problems, he consulted a neurosurgeon, Dr. William\nSpence. When x-rays did not reveal the problem, he proposed a myelogram\nduring which a dye would be injected into the spinal column to help visual-\nize any abnormality.\nBased on the myelogram, a rupured disk was suspected, and, in February\nof 1959, a laminectomy was performed to which his mother consented\n(apparently after the operation was over) because Canterbury was a minor.\nAfter the procedure, Dr. Spence told him to stay in bed while voiding, but\nthe orders were changed (it is unclear by whom), indicating he should get\nout of bed to urinate. Hospital personnel gave him a receptacle in which\nto void and left him unattended. Canterbury slipped off the side of the bed\nand fell to the floor.

After a di-\nrected verdict in favor of the doctor and hospital, Canterbury appealed to the\nfederal Court of Appeals. In addressing the consent issues, that court noted\nthat many jurisdictions rely on “the custom of physicians practicing in the\ncommunity to make the particular disclosure to the patient.” This court, how-\never, adopted a different standard. After rejecting the notion that there must\nbe “full” disclosure, the court held that the physician must disclose every-\nthing that the patient would need to know in making the decision for the\ntherapy, that is, everything that is “material to the decision.” This standard\nis independent of the practice of physicians in the community. It is what\nhas come to be called “the reasonable-man” or later “the personable-person”\nstandard.

The brain damage was compounded by the fact that Lindbergh\nwent without breathing for approximately 15 minutes as rescuers tried to free\nhim from the wreckage.\nSomerdale detective Charles Pope said he arrived at the crash site five\nminutes after the accident occurred. \"He was more or less all mangled up\nunder the steering wheel,” said Pope. He said that after Lindbergh was re-\nmoved from the car his heart stopped beating and CPR was administered.\nReferring to his parents, who were called from Sweden to be at his side, Vicki\nSantoro, nursing supervisor at the hospital said, “They were just devastated.”\nFlyers’ team physician Edward Viner said that if Lindbergh's situation\ndoes not improve, the family will be left with a decision about how long to leave\nhim on the respirator.\n“He's a person that loves life,” [flyers Coach Mike] Keenan said of\nLindbergh.\nStratford, NJ Nov. 11 [Monday]—The injuries to Lindbergh ... left the\ngoalie brain dead. With cardiac stimulants and fluid replacement to keep his\nblood pressure up, Lindbergh was still alive tonight, but with no chance to\nsurvive. :\n“We simply now work with the family to decide how far they want to go\nin sustaining his biological life,” said Dr. Lewis Gallo, one of the hospital doc-\ntors assigned to the case. Withouta respirator, Gallo added, Lindbergh would\nstop breathing “in a matter of minutes.”\nViner said the respirator keeping Lindbergh alive would be discon-\nnected “as soon as they can come to grips with this as a family. ... I’m con-\ncerned about the father’s own health. He's not well and I understand he has a\nsignificant heart condition.”\nStratford, NJ, Nov. 12 [Tuesday]—Pelle Lindbergh, the Philadelphia Flyers\ngoalie who had been brain dead since a car crash early Sunday morning,\nwas declared dead tonight after surgeons removed all his oat organs for\npossible transplantation.\nLindbergh, 26, who suffered extensive brain and spinal injuries, was of-\nficially declared clinically dead Monday morning while his heart and lungs\nwere kept functioning only through the use of a respirator.\nTeam Captain Dave Poulin said, “If his organs can be donated that will\nhelp others and Pelle will live on.”",

        "case": "Case 18-2 ee\nAmbiguous Advance Directives: Who Interprets?\nThe following case was presented to a hospital ethics committee. The\npatient, Molly Murton, is a 74-year-old female first admitted to the hospi-\ntal in June with an acute cerebral vascular accident and currently has a\ndiagnosis of “multi-infarct dementia.” She has deteriorated since her first\nadmission and is now very weak, not coherent, and has to be spoon-fed\nby the nursing staff. She swallows poorly. The patient was transferred to\nthe acute hospital because of swallowing difficulties and aspiration\npneumonia on three occasions in the past year. Two years ago, the pa-\ntient made out a Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPAHC)\nnaming her daughter, Helen, as the agent but making no other comments\non the form.\nA year later, one year before the present admission, she made out\nanother DPAHC, with a skilled care facility ombudsman in attendance, in\nwhich she again named her daughter as agent but also added on the form\nthat she wanted no efforts made to prolong her life, no CPR, and no feed-\ning tubes inserted. The patient was presumably considered competent\nwhen she signed the second DPAHC. Her daughter was not in attendance\nat the time.\nSubsequently, no feeding tubes were inserted despite three admis-\nsions for aspiration pneumonia. Now that she is having severe difficulty\nwith oral nutrition, her daughter, unwilling to see her mother suffer, has\ndecided she wants a gastrostomy tube inserted to decrease the likelihood\nof aspiration. She also indicated that if her mother develops pneumonia or\nanother potential fatal complication, she does not want her transferred to\nthe acute hospital. She wants her to be given comfort care in the skilled\ncare facility. The physician fully agreed with the daughter's decision.\nHowever, the administrator of the skilled care facility was uncertain that\nit was legal or ethical for the daughter to go against her mother’s expressly\nstated wishes not to have a feeding tube inserted. The insertion of the\ntube would be for the purposes of comfort and avoidance of aspiration\npneumonia but might potentially prolong her life, which had been objected\nto by the mother.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nSince Ms. Murton specifically stated that she didn’t want a feeding tube in her\nsecond version of her advance directive, should the physician follow the\ndaughter's request?\n| What should the ethics committee say to the skilled care facility administrator\nin response to his concerns?",

        "case": "Case 13-3\nThe Cruzan Case: Whether to Forgo Nutrition\nBased on a Patient’s Views\nAt 12:54 a.m., January 11, 1983, police were called to the scene of a single car\naccident. They arrived six minutes later and found Nancy Cruzan lying\nface down in a ditch thirty-five feet from her car without detectable cardiac\nor respiratory function. At 1:12 a.m., spontaneous cardiac and respiratory\nfunction was restored, but there had been significant anoxia for as much as\ntwelve to fourteen minutes.\nNancy was left with permanent brain damage, in a coma for three\nweeks. A gastrostomy was performed on February 7, consented to by her\n(then) husband. Since then she had been at Mount Vernon State Hospital,\nfed entirely by gastrostomy tube. At the time of review of the case, she was\nnot on a ventilator, was oblivious to her environment except for reflexive\nresponses to sound and perhaps painful stimuli, and had a massive en-\nlargement of the ventricles of her brain that were filling with cerebrospinal\nfluid. The finding was that cerebral cortical atrophy was irreversible, per-\nmanent, progressive, and ongoing.\nThe highest cognitive brain function was exhibited by her grimacing,\nperhaps in recognition of ordinarily painful stimuli, indicating the experi-\nence of pain and apparent response to sound. She was described as a\nspastic quadriplegic with irreversible muscular contracture and tendon\ndamage in all extremities, no cognitive or reflexive ability to swallow food\nor water to maintain her daily essential needs. She was alive but in a per-\nsistent vegetative state (PVS). She could live for decades in this condition.\nBefore the accident she had expressed, “in somewhat serious conver-\nsation,” that if sick or injured she would not want to continue her life unless\nshe could live “halfway normally.” Her parents, Lester and Joyce, took over\nthe role of guardian and asked the Missouri courts for permission to termi-\nnate artificial hydration and nutrition.\nThe lower court supported their request, but the Missouri Supreme Court\nreversed, arguing the state has an unqualified interest in life without regard\nto quality. This interest took two forms: (1) prolongation of life of individual\npatients and (2) interest in sanctity of life itself. Moreover, the case raises the\nquestion of how certain we must be of the patient's wishes. In this case, Nancy\nhad not explicitly stated she would refuse nutrition and hydration medically\nsupplied. The state noted how this case differs from other famous cases in that\nNancy was not a competent patient contemporaneously refusing treatment;\nshe did not have an advance directive, she was not terminal, the treatment\ncould not be a burden to her (since she was in a vegetative state), and this case\ninvolved nutrition and hydration rather than more complex treatments.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n» Why would artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently than other\nmore complex treatments?\nShould artificial nutrition and hydration be viewed differently?\n/Is a “somewhat serious conversation” enough evidence to discontinue life-\nsustaining treatment? Why or why not?",

        "case": "» Case 18-4\nWithholding Chemotherapy for an Impaired Patient\nJoseph Saikewicz, a 67-year-old white male, was reported to have an Intel-\nligence Quotient (IQ) of 10 and mental age of approximately 2 years,\n8 months, but was otherwise in good health, strong, and well built. He was\nnot able to communicate verbally, using grunts and gestures instead. He\nhad been institutionalized in a state school since 1923 and at the Belchertown\nState School in Massachusetts since 1928. His only known family was two\nsisters who lived in California.\nOn April 19, 1976, Mr. Saikewicz was diagnosed as suffering from acute\nmyeloblastic monocytic leukemia. His physician proposed chemotherapy.\nIt was believed that, with chemotherapy, he had a remission chance of\n30-50 percent. If remission does occur it will typically last for two to thirteen\nmonths, possibly longer. The side effects include nausea, bladder irritation,\nnumbness and tingling of extremities, loss of hair, and bone marrow depres-\nsion. He would die in a matter of weeks or months without the chemotherapy.\nHe was not in pain.\nIt was agreed that most competent patients would elect to undergo\nchemotherapy, but Mr. Saikewicz was unable to understand what would be\ndone with him. The medical personnel envisioned that they would have to\nuse orderlies to hold him down on his bed while the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusions were administered. Thus, even though mentally normal\npeople would choose the therapy because they could understand the ratio-\nnale, for Mr. Saikewicz it would appear that his caregivers had turned on\nhim and were inflicting an unkind and painful assault.\nFor these reasons, his physician recommended that the chemotherapy\nbe omitted. It would offer, for him, more burden than benefit. The adminis-\ntrator of the school was not certain this was ethical or legal. In order to re-\nsolve the conflict, they asked for a judicial opinion on what to do.\nPerhaps because in the early part of the twentieth century families\nwere advised not to visit or bond with those placed in institutional facili-\nties, his sisters chose not to attend the hearing. Mr. Saikewicz was thus\nwithout any family or friends to assist except for the administrative and\nhealth care staff of the school. The issue was whether it was in Mr. Saikewicz’'s\ninterest, given his unique mental capacity, to receive the chemotherapy and\nblood transfusion.\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court rendered an opinion that\ncalled into question the role of doctors, family, and hospital committees in\nmaking these decisions, stating: “We take a dim view of any attempt to\nshift the ultimate decision-making responsibility away from the duly es-\ntablished courts of proper jurisdiction to... the attending doctors, family,\nor hospital ethics committees.”\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nGiven these circumstances, what should be done for Mr. Saikewicz and who\nshould make the choice?\nHow does the doctrine of proportionality apply in this case?",

        "case": "Case 18-5\nPicking Parents to Make Good Medical Choices\nPhillip Becker was 12 years old in 1978 when critical medical problems\narose in his care. He had been born on October 16, 1966. He was determined\nto have Down syndrome, a congenital heart defect (a ventricular septal\ndefect), and elevated pulmonary blood pressure. With these problems he\n- would suffer progressive loss of energy and vitality until he is forced to\nlead a bed-to-chair existence.\nFor reasons that are unknown, when Phillip was an infant no action\nwas taken to correct his septal defect. In 1977, Dr. Gathman, a pediatric\ncardiologist, recommended catheterization to determine if an operation\nwould be appropriate at this late point for the septal defect. Phillip was\nreferred to second cardiologist who is less convinced than Dr. Gathman\nthat the procedure would help.\nPhillip's parents were told that the mortality risk from an operation\nwas between 5 and 10 percent and that children with Down syndrome\nhave higher-than-average risk. Without the operation he will face severe\nincapacitation. The longer the wait, the more risky the procedure will\nbecome. The heart must work three times harder than normal to supply\nblood. Without the operation he may live twenty more years. With it—if it\nis successful—he will live the life of a normal Down syndrome child,\nwhich, they were told, is less than a normal life span but clearly longer\nthan twenty years.\nConsidering all of the risks and benefits, Phillip’s parents refused the\noperation. They gave a range of arguments based on the welfare of child\nincluding the risk of immediate mortality, the pain and suffering from the\nsurgery, and the concern that they were responsible for Phillip’s welfare\nand that, if he outlived them, he could suffer from neglect from whoever\nwould end up caring for him. The court accepted the parental refusal on\nthese grounds.\nAlthough it had not been emphasized during the original court delib-\nerations, Phillip had been transferred to a residential facility called the\nWe-Care facility in 1972. It was claimed that the parents had been advised\nnot to remain emotionally close to Phillip in order to spare him the trauma\nof not being with them. ;\nA volunteer named Patsy Heath became involved and began to de-\nvelop a bond with Phillip. Eventually, he began making overnight visits to\nthe Heath household and was accepted as part of their family. The Heaths\nwere awarded guardianship on August 7, 1981, on the grounds that the\nHeaths were, de facto, the psychological parents and should have custody.\nIn doing so the second court was aware that the Heaths wanted Philip to\nundergo the operation.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\nReview the reasons the Beckers refused the surgical procedure for Phillip. Do\nyou find the reasons sound or not?\nHow much, if at all, does the diagnosis of Down syndrome influence your view\nof whether the surgery should be performed or not?\nGiven that the Beckers thought surgical correction was not in Phillip’s interest\nand the Heaths thought it was, should custody be determined on the basis of\nwhich adults are making the most defensible choice for Phillip?",

        "case": "Case 18-6\nThe Case of the Suspect Surrogates\nTwo weeks before the Ethics Committee consultation at a hospital in Phila-\ndelphia, a 76-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital's emergency\nroom (ER), some three hours after having fallen and found to be uncon-\nscious. Only fragmentary history could be obtained. The family later was\nfound to be a local ex-husband, a sister with whom the patient lived, a\ndaughter in Boston, and a daughter in Ohio. Computer tomography (CT)\nscan of the head showed a subdural hematoma. The patient was taken to\nthe operating room after a delay of a couple of hours due to lack of avail-\nable room in the OR. During the operation, both a fresh subdural hema-\ntoma and a chronic subdural hematoma were removed. Postoperatively,\nthe patient has remained unconscious, attached to a ventilator through an\nendotracheal tube and fed by nasogastric (NG) tube. Though the patient\nhas remained comatose, by eleven days postoperatively the patient was\nable to be weaned off the ventilator and was breathing on her own through\nthe endotracheal tube.\nThe attending physician was able to get some additional history from\nthe daughter in Ohio. She indicated that the patient was disabled since a\nleft craniotomy fifteen years earlier for an auto-accident head injury. It is\nnot clear to what extent she was disabled; however, beginning in January\n1998, six months before the admission to the hospital, the patient was said\nto have begun failing, became confused and stopped reading newspapers\nand watching television. According to the Ohio daughter, the patient has\nbeen living with her sister who is said to be a drug addict and to have\nphysically abused the patient. The ethics consultation was called because\nof a conflict about what to do next. The pulmonary consultant had advised\nthat a tracheostomy be performed so that the endotracheal tube could be\nremoved. Also, consideration was being given to replacement of the NG\ntube with a gastrostomy tube for long-term nutrition. The attending physi-\ncian had talked with the neurosurgeon who felt that the patient would\nwake up. The neurosurgeon, however, did not indicate what he thought\nwould be the patient's functional deficit upon awakening. The attending\nphysician concluded that the tracheostomy should be performed and the\ngastrostomy tube placed. He then called and explained this information to\nthe daughter in Ohio. She expressed a strong desire directing the attend-\ning physician that no further treatment be given toward maintaining her\nmother’s life, including tracheostomy and tube feedings, if she were to\nremain in a vegetative state. She indicated that her sister in Boston would\nagree with her decision. The attending physician disagreed with the\ndaughter's feelings but was concerned about the ethical issues involved.\nThe patient had no Living Will or Durable Power of Attorney for Health\nCare. There was no evidence of the patient's own wishes. The ex-husband\napparently appeared once shortly after admission as a “courtesy call.” The\npatient's sister did not visit or communicate with the doctors. Neither of the\ntwo daughters traveled to the patient's bedside. In fact, the daughter in\nBoston could not be reached. The attending physician was aware that the\nOhio daughter had not seen her mother in at least three months; she did not\ncome now when her mother was critically ill and did not remove her from\nthe patient's sister, who the Ohio daughter herself had said was physically\nabusive to her.\nQuestions for Thought and Discussion\n) Is there a valid surrogate? Who?\nWhat do you think the ethics committee should say to the attending physician?\n+ Should the tracheostomy be performed and the gastrostomy tube inserted?",

He had been on dialysis for\nfour years and tolerated it well. Now, however, his disease had progressed\nto the point that he needed a blood transfusion to survive. He said he\nwanted to live, but he was a Jehovah's Witness and was a classical blood\nrefuser.
