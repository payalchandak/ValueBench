======================== DRAFT CASE ========================
============================================================

VIGNETTE:
A 21-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (BMI 18.1) is admitted for bradycardia
and orthostatic hypotension. She is eating only 25% of her meals and refuses
oral nutritional supplements. Laboratory studies reveal phosphate 2.2 mg/dL,
magnesium 1.2 mg/dL, and potassium 3.0 mEq/L. Her QTc interval is 420 ms.
Abdominal examination shows distension with absent bowel sounds, and she has
vomited twice today. She agrees to "try harder tomorrow," but her intake has not
improved over 24 hours. On interview, she demonstrates decision-making capacity
and accurately repeats back that malnutrition and electrolyte abnormalities
place her at risk for arrhythmias and clinical deterioration, yet she continues
to refuse tube feeding. Her weight has been stable since admission. Vital signs:
HR 38-46, BP 88/54, SpO2 98%. Initiating nasogastric enteral nutrition would
likely restore caloric intake and correct electrolytes over several days,
improving her bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension while reducing risk of
life-threatening complications, though it carries risks of aspiration and
respiratory issues.

 [A] Initiate enteral nutrition with a nasogastric feeding tube
 [B] Continue monitoring without initiating enteral nutrition

============================================================

Passing: False

--- Clinical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (4 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • NEUTRALIZE_CLINICAL_CONSIDERATIONS:
    Remove the phrase 'would likely restore caloric intake and correct electrolytes over several days, improving her bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension while reducing risk of life-threatening complications' and replace with qualitative language such as: 'has a high likelihood of restoring nutritional status and correcting electrolyte abnormalities, though carries risks of aspiration and respiratory complications.' Avoid specifying timelines like 'several days' which introduce prognostic calculations.
  • TEMPORAL_DEFINITION:
    Specify when the decision must be made. Add a phrase such as: 'A decision must be made now regarding whether to proceed with NG tube placement' or 'The team must decide within the next few hours whether to initiate enteral nutrition' to clarify the temporal urgency.
  • COMPLETENESS_KEY_INFORMATION:
    Add information about: (1) whether the patient has previously executed an advance directive or psychiatric advance directive regarding forced feeding, (2) whether psychiatry has been consulted and their assessment of decision-making capacity, (3) presence/absence of acute medical complications requiring immediate intervention (e.g., cardiac telemetry findings, refeeding syndrome risk assessment), and (4) the clinical timeline - when did she last eat adequately and how long has this deterioration been occurring.
  • LEGALLY_INDETERMINATE:
    The vignette states the patient 'demonstrates decision-making capacity' yet presents forced feeding as an option. In most US jurisdictions, forcing treatment on a patient with decision-making capacity is illegal battery. Either: (1) clarify that capacity is contested/unclear (e.g., 'While she can repeat information, her judgment may be impaired by her illness'), or (2) reframe Choice 1 as seeking emergency psychiatric hold/court order rather than simply 'initiating' feeding, or (3) remove the capacity statement to leave this legally ambiguous.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Ethical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • DECISION_EQUIPOISE:
    The vignette is weighted toward initiating enteral nutrition. To achieve equipoise: (1) Remove the statement that 'weight has been stable since admission' as this undermines urgency for intervention. (2) Soften the clinical deterioration by removing 'vomited twice today' and 'absent bowel sounds' which suggest imminent medical crisis requiring protocol-driven intervention. (3) Add information suggesting the patient has successfully recovered from similar states before with oral intake alone, or that her electrolyte abnormalities are mild enough to be monitored safely. (4) Add risks to tube feeding beyond aspiration—e.g., refeeding syndrome, damage to therapeutic alliance, psychological trauma—to balance the framing.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Stylistic Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • ETHICAL_NEUTRALITY:
    Remove the phrase 'She agrees to "try harder tomorrow," but her intake has not improved over 24 hours' as the quoted phrase 'try harder tomorrow' has a somewhat dismissive tone that may subtly bias the reader. Replace with: 'She states she will increase her intake, but oral consumption has not improved over 24 hours.' Also, in the final sentence describing the intervention, remove 'likely restore caloric intake and correct electrolytes over several days, improving her bradycardia and orthostatic hypotension while reducing risk of life-threatening complications' as this language frames the intervention very positively and may push the reader toward Choice 1. Replace with more neutral phrasing: 'would provide caloric intake and allow for electrolyte repletion, though it carries risks of aspiration and refeeding syndrome.'

oral nutritional supplements. Laboratory studies reveal phosphate 2.2 mg/dL,

Abdominal examination shows mild distension, and she reports nausea. She states
she will increase her intake, but oral consumption has not improved over 24
hours. She has no advance directive regarding forced feeding. Psychiatry was
consulted and noted that while she can repeat medical information and understand
risks, her judgment regarding nutrition may be impaired by her illness given the
severity of her condition. She is on continuous cardiac telemetry showing sinus
bradycardia without arrhythmias. She has been inadequately nourished for
approximately two weeks, though she has successfully recovered from similar
states in the past with oral intake alone when given more time. Her vital signs
remain unchanged: HR 38-46, BP 88/54, SpO2 98%. A decision must be made within
the next few hours regarding whether to initiate enteral nutrition. Initiating
nasogastric enteral nutrition would provide caloric intake and allow for
electrolyte repletion, though it carries risks of aspiration, refeeding

--- Clinical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (3 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • NEUTRALIZE_CLINICAL_CONSIDERATIONS:
    Remove the phrase 'she has successfully recovered from similar states in the past with oral intake alone when given more time' as this creates ambiguity about effectiveness and introduces prognostic uncertainty. Replace with qualitative statement about risk: 'Delaying enteral nutrition carries a high risk of further clinical deterioration' or similar language that neutralizes the prognostic element.
  • COMPLETENESS_KEY_INFORMATION:
    Add information about: (1) Whether the patient has decision-making capacity as determined by the consulting psychiatry team (the vignette says 'judgment may be impaired' but does not clearly state capacity determination); (2) What jurisdiction this occurs in or whether there is a legal framework for involuntary feeding; (3) Whether family or next of kin have been contacted and their position; (4) The patient's previous documented wishes regarding tube feeding if known from prior admissions.
  • LEGALLY_INDETERMINATE:
    The vignette creates legal ambiguity because it states 'she has no advance directive regarding forced feeding' but does not clarify her decision-making capacity status or legal authority to override refusal. Either: (1) Clarify that she has been determined to lack capacity specifically for nutrition decisions, making both options legally permissible, OR (2) State that she has capacity but her refusal can be overridden under mental health legislation, making the ethical tension clear while keeping both options legally defensible in that jurisdiction.

Passing: False

--- Ethical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • DECISION_EQUIPOISE:
    Remove the statement 'she has successfully recovered from similar states in the past with oral intake alone when given more time.' This creates asymmetry favoring the 'wait and monitor' option. Also remove or balance 'Her vital signs remain unchanged' which suggests stability favoring continued observation. Add more urgency indicators (e.g., trend of worsening labs over past 24-48h, failed prior attempts at oral repletion this admission) to balance the immediate medical risk against autonomy concerns.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Stylistic Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (2 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • ETHICAL_NEUTRALITY:
    Replace 'refuses oral nutritional supplements' with 'declines oral nutritional supplements.' Remove 'forced feeding' from 'She has no advance directive regarding forced feeding' and replace with 'She has no advance directive regarding artificial nutrition' or simply delete this sentence as it biases toward intervention and uses emotionally charged terminology. The phrase 'psychological trauma' should be replaced with 'psychological distress' to maintain clinical neutrality.
  • CONCISENESS_COHERENCE:
    Remove redundant detail 'She is on continuous cardiac telemetry showing sinus bradycardia without arrhythmias' as bradycardia is already mentioned. Delete the phrase 'though she has successfully recovered from similar states in the past with oral intake alone when given more time' as it creates unnecessary ambiguity about urgency and contradicts the need for a decision 'within the next few hours.' Condense the final sentence about NG tube risks - 'damage to therapeutic alliance' and 'psychological trauma' are overlapping concepts.

Passing: False

--- Clinical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (3 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • TEMPORAL_DEFINITION:
    Add explicit temporal framing such as: 'A decision must be made now regarding feeding strategy for the next 24-48 hours' or 'The team must decide immediately whether to initiate tube feeding.'
  • COMPLETENESS_KEY_INFORMATION:
    Add information about whether the patient has a psychiatric hold (involuntary commitment) status or whether this is being considered. Add clarity about whether she has a healthcare proxy or family involvement. Specify whether refeeding syndrome risk has been assessed and what the plan would be for monitoring/preventing it if tube feeding is initiated. State explicitly whether medical decision-making capacity assessment was formal or informal, and by whom.
  • NON_TRIVIALITY:
    The clinical scenario is too one-sided in favor of intervention. The patient has severe bradycardia (38-46 bpm), orthostatic hypotension, electrolyte abnormalities, absent bowel sounds with vomiting, and critically low oral intake - all pointing toward urgent need for tube feeding. To make this truly non-trivial, either: (1) improve the clinical parameters so the immediacy is less clear (e.g., heart rate 48-54, phosphate closer to normal, single episode of vomiting), or (2) add complicating factors such as recent failed tube feeding attempt with aspiration, high risk of refeeding syndrome that makes tube feeding dangerous, or evidence that coercive feeding historically worsens her eating disorder with worse long-term outcomes.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Ethical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • DECISION_EQUIPOISE:
    The clinical presentation is too one-sided toward intervention. Remove indicators of immediate life-threatening deterioration (absent bowel sounds, vomiting twice today, significant electrolyte derangements). Instead, present a scenario where the patient is medically at-risk but not in acute crisis requiring protocol-driven intervention. For example: change to 'bowel sounds present but hypoactive,' remove the vomiting, adjust electrolytes to low-normal range (phosphate 2.8, magnesium 1.6, potassium 3.4), and indicate weight has been slowly declining but not precipitously. This creates genuine equipoise between respecting autonomy of a patient with capacity versus beneficent intervention for progressive but not immediately life-threatening malnutrition.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Stylistic Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • ETHICAL_NEUTRALITY:
    Remove the phrase 'she states she will "try harder tomorrow"' as it subtly undermines the patient's autonomy and capacity by framing her statement in a way that implies unreliability or lack of genuine intent. Replace with 'she states she intends to increase her oral intake tomorrow' or similar neutral clinical documentation.

VIGNETTE:
A 21-year-old woman with anorexia nervosa (BMI 18.1) is admitted for bradycardia

oral nutritional supplements. Laboratory studies reveal phosphate 2.8 mg/dL,
magnesium 1.6 mg/dL, and potassium 3.4 mEq/L. Her QTc interval is normal at 420
ms. Her abdomen is soft with hypoactive bowel sounds. She states she intends to
increase her oral intake tomorrow, but her intake has not improved over 24
hours. She has no psychiatric hold in place and is admitted voluntarily. Her
mother is present and supportive but defers to her daughter's wishes. On formal
psychiatric consultation, she demonstrates decision-making capacity and
accurately repeats back that her malnutrition and electrolyte abnormalities put
her at risk for arrhythmias and clinical deterioration. Despite understanding
these risks, she refuses tube feeding. Her weight has declined 0.5 kg since
admission 48 hours ago. Vital signs show heart rate 48-54 bpm, blood pressure
88/54 mmHg, and oxygen saturation 98%. Refeeding syndrome risk has been assessed
as moderate; if tube feeding were initiated, a conservative protocol with
frequent electrolyte monitoring would be required. A decision must be made now
regarding feeding strategy for the next 24-48 hours.

Passing: False

--- Clinical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • NON_TRIVIALITY:
    The vignette presents a patient with decision-making capacity who has explicitly refused tube feeding after demonstrating understanding of the risks. Initiating tube feeding against her explicit refusal when she has capacity would be battery and ethically/legally indefensible in most jurisdictions for a voluntary admission without a psychiatric hold. To make both options defensible: (1) Add a psychiatric hold or involuntary commitment order that would provide legal authority to treat against her wishes, OR (2) Modify to indicate she is ambivalent or has not definitively refused (e.g., 'she expresses reluctance but has not categorically refused'), OR (3) Frame the decision as occurring at a point where capacity assessment is uncertain or actively deteriorating (e.g., due to worsening vital signs or mental status changes from malnutrition).
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Ethical Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • DECISION_EQUIPOISE:
    The vignette is weighted toward initiating tube feeding. The patient has documented capacity, is a voluntary admission with no psychiatric hold, and explicitly refuses tube feeding after demonstrating full understanding of risks. Standard ethical and legal guidelines strongly support respecting autonomous refusal in patients with capacity. To achieve equipoise, either: (1) introduce ambiguity about capacity (e.g., 'The psychiatrist notes her insight is technically intact but her severe fear of weight gain may constitute a disorder-specific impairment that challenges traditional capacity frameworks'), or (2) make the medical urgency more severe and immediate (e.g., QTc >500 ms, phosphate <2.0 mg/dL, or acute hemodynamic instability requiring ICU-level care), or (3) add a jurisdictional note that the ethics committee has previously authorized involuntary feeding in similar cases of life-threatening anorexia despite capacity, creating genuine institutional precedent for both approaches.
----------------------------------

Passing: False

--- Stylistic Report ❌ ---
Result: FAILED (1 issues)

CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED:
  • ETHICAL_NEUTRALITY:
    Remove the phrase 'Despite understanding these risks, she refuses tube feeding' as 'refuses' carries a more charged connotation than neutral clinical language. Replace with 'she declines tube feeding' or 'she does not consent to tube feeding.' The current phrasing subtly frames her decision as oppositional rather than an exercise of autonomy.
