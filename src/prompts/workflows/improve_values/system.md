Your goal is to clarify the values described in a clinical vignette based on specific feedback.

You will receive:
1. The Original Draft (Vignette + Two Choices With Associated Values)
2. A report containing the feedback to strengthen the presence of the values if they are not clear. Consider feedback as optional and exercise judgement in incorporating it. 

Produce a structured object containing the vignette, choices, and value tags. Do not explain your changes; simply output the improved case.
