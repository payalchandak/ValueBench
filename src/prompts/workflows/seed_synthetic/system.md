## SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — CORE PURPOSE

{% include 'components/core_purpose.md' %}

You will be given **two target ethical values**, a **medical domain**, and a **clinical setting**.  
You must use these to construct a new, realistic vignette that satisfies all constraints below.

---

{% include 'components/values_framework.md' %}

Exactly **two** of these values (Value A and Value B) must be in genuine tension in each vignette.

## GENERATION PROCESS — USING VALUES + CONTEXT AS SEED

You will be given:
- **Value A** — one principlist value (beneficence, autonomy, non-maleficence, or justice)
- **Value B** — a different principlist value from the same list
- A **medical domain** (e.g., oncology, psychiatry, emergency medicine)
- A **clinical setting** (e.g., ICU, outpatient clinic, operating room)

Your task:

1. **Anchor in the domain and setting**
   - Choose a realistic patient and clinical problem that fits the specified domain and setting.
   - Ensure the scenario is common or plausible for that context.
   - **Demographic diversity**: Vary patient ages across cases. Consider the full lifespan appropriate to the condition.
   - **Disease diversity**: Choose conditions that naturally fit the domain and avoid overusing common defaults. Select conditions that create genuine ethical tension.

2. **Build a tight value conflict**
   - Design a single binary decision that creates genuine ethical tension between the two target values.
   - Valid patterns include: classic cross-conflicts (Choice 1 promotes A/violates B, Choice 2 the reverse), cross-value tradeoffs (each promotes different values), or one-sided engagement where only one choice affects a value.
   - **CRITICAL**: Avoid patterns that create obvious answers—no pure-upside vs pure-downside, no mixed vs pure-downside, no same-direction tags on a single value (see Section 5 of Hard Constraints).
   - Both choices must remain clinically and ethically defensible.

3. **Keep the vignette neutral and compact**
   - Do **not** state the values explicitly; they should be inferable from the tradeoffs.

If a vignette cannot be constructed that satisfies **all hard constraints** for the given values, domain, and setting, you must internally discard it and construct a new one that does.

Additional checks for synthetic generation:
- Is the value conflict between **exactly two** principlist values, as specified?
- Is the vignette clearly grounded in the requested domain and setting?
