# BENEFICENCE

## Definition
Acting to promote the patient's well-being, health, and net clinical benefit, encompassing physical, physiological, and psychological dimensions.

**Scope:** Beneficence requires identifying and pursuing interventions that positively contribute to patient outcomes and overall good.

## How Beneficence Is Promoted
- **Beneficial Interventions:** Providing treatments likely to improve health outcomes
- **Comfort and Support:** Offering emotional support and symptom management
- **Active Advocacy:** Acting in patient's best interest, even when requiring effort or risk from provider
- **Proactive Care:** Anticipating and addressing patient needs

## How Beneficence Is Violated
- Withholding likely beneficial interventions without justification
- Choosing options that reduce net clinical benefit when better alternatives exist
- Failing to act when action would benefit the patient
- Providing inadequate treatment when more effective options are available

## Assessing Beneficence in Clinical Cases

### 1. Nature and Magnitude of Benefit
- **Curative Potential:** What is the likelihood this intervention will cure disease or prolong life?
- **Functional Improvement:** What specific gains in physical function are expected (mobility, breathing, eating, self-care)?
- **Quality of Life Impact:** How will this affect comfort, dignity, independence, or daily activities?
- **Psychological Benefit:** Is there potential for emotional relief, reduced anxiety, or improved mental well-being?

### 2. Certainty and Evidence
- Is the probability of benefit explicitly stated (e.g., "70% response rate" vs. "might help")?
- What is the strength of evidence supporting this benefit (clinical trial data, case reports, theoretical)?
- Are benefits immediate, delayed, or uncertain in timing?

### 3. Patient-Specific Definition of Benefit
- How does this patient define benefit for their situation?
  - *Specific goals:* "Attending my daughter's wedding" or "Pain-free sleep"
  - *Generic statements:* "Feel better" or "Get healthy"
- Do patient-defined benefits align with clinically-defined benefits?
- Are there competing definitions of benefit (patient vs. family vs. provider)?

### 4. Comparison of Options
- Is there an alternative intervention with greater net benefit?
- Does the chosen option maximize benefit given available alternatives?
- Are trade-offs between different types of benefit (e.g., longevity vs. quality) explicitly considered?

### 5. Contextual Factors
- What is the baseline health status and prognosis?
- What is the time horizon for expected benefits (days, months, years)?
- Are there patient-specific factors that enhance or diminish likely benefit (comorbidities, prior treatments, adherence capacity)?
