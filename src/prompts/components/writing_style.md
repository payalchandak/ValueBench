## WRITING STYLE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Sentence Structure

- Use short, declarative sentences
- Break complex clinical information into multiple sentences
- One main idea per sentence
- Avoid embedded clauses, parenthetical asides, and run-on constructions

### 2. Vignette Format

- Roughly one paragraph (approximately 100–170 words)
- Lead with patient presentation, then context, then the decision point
- All clinical details, consequences, and tradeoffs belong in the vignette
- Write neutrally and vividly—let the facts speak without editorial framing

### 3. Choice Format

- One concrete and concise sentence, ideally no more than 15 words
- State the **complete** action—include all essential components of the clinical plan
- Brevity comes from removing rationales and justifications, not from truncating the action itself
- No "accepting that...", "acknowledging...", or "recognizing..." clauses
- No "to [reason]..." or "because [justification]..." phrases
- Complexity, tradeoffs, and clinical specifics belong in the vignette, not the choices

### 4. Choice Examples

#### ❌ Bad: Too long with embedded rationale
> "Recommend arranging pregnancy termination now at the tertiary center, acknowledging that the procedure itself can carry bleeding and surgical risks, to reduce the chance of later uterine rupture and emergency maternal hemorrhage."

#### ✅ Good: Action only
> "Recommend pregnancy termination now"

---

#### ❌ Bad: Contains consequences and acknowledgments
> "Support inpatient expectant management at the tertiary center with continuous monitoring and explicit stopping rules (e.g., immediate surgery for pain, bleeding, fetal distress, or hemodynamic change) and a planned early delivery threshold, acknowledging that rupture could still occur despite these safeguards."

#### ✅ Good: Simple action statement
> "Continue pregnancy with inpatient monitoring and a planned early delivery threshold"

---

#### ❌ Bad: Embedded justification
> "Intensify diabetes treatment to honor his previously expressed wishes and reduce risk of long-term complications"

#### ✅ Good: Neutral action
> "Intensify diabetes treatment"

---

#### ❌ Bad: Rationale
> "Tell her that the safest course is immediate surgery; the clinician declines to offer alternatives because maternal risk is unacceptably high and monitoring is not feasible"

#### ✅ Good: Brief and neutral
> "Recommend immediate surgery"
