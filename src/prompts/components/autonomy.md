# AUTONOMY

## Definition
Respect for patients' rights to informed decision-making and self-determination in medical care, consistent with their personal values, beliefs, and preferences.

**Scope:** Clinically relevant only when patients actively communicate preferences, goals, beliefs, or advance directives.

## How Autonomy Is Promoted
- **Information Disclosure:** Providing clear, comprehensive information about diagnosis, prognosis, treatment options, risks/benefits, alternatives, and probable outcomes
- **Voluntary Decision-Making:** Ensuring decisions are free from coercion, with adequate time for deliberation
- **Honoring Preferences:** Respecting and implementing stated treatment choices, refusals, advance directives, and goals of care

## How Autonomy Is Violated
- Overriding patient decisions without legal justification
- Deprioritizing patient preferences in clinical decision-making
- Paternalistic substitution of provider judgment for patient choice
- Withholding, distorting, or selectively presenting information
- Obtaining consent through inadequate disclosure or rushed processes

## Assessing Autonomy in Clinical Cases

### 1. Capacity and Stability
- Is decision-making capacity formally documented?
- Has this preference been expressed consistently, or is this a sudden change?

### 2. Patient Values and Goals
- Are core goals and priorities explicitly stated in patient's own words?
- Are values consistent across encounters?
- Has patient identified external constraints (financial, caregiving, legal) affecting choices?

### 3. Understanding of Medical Information
- Can patient articulate diagnosis and prognosis?
- Does patient acknowledge specific risks of each option, including no treatment?
- Does patient connect facts to personal circumstances (e.g., "I can't risk recovery time because I'm sole caregiver") vs. generic statements?

### 4. Quality of Reasoning
- Is the stated choice logically consistent with articulated values?
- Does patient acknowledge trade-offs (e.g., "shorter survival, but quality time matters more")?
- Can patient compare options along personally meaningful dimensions?

### 5. Red Flags
Coached responses, inability to explain reasoning, value-action discrepancy, signs of external pressure, sudden unexplained preference changes
