# JUSTICE

## Definition
Ensuring fair, equitable, and appropriate distribution of healthcare resources and treatment of patients without bias or discrimination.

**Scope:** Balances individual patient needs with population-level needs, fair allocation of limited resources, and equitable access to care regardless of patient characteristics.

## How Justice Is Promoted
- **Fair Resource Allocation:** Distributing limited resources (ICU beds, organs, medications, staff time) based on clinical need and ethical criteria
- **Non-Discrimination:** Treating patients equitably regardless of race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, insurance, or other non-medical factors
- **Policy Adherence:** Upholding allocation policies that balance individual and collective needs
- **Equitable Access:** Ensuring comparable patients have comparable access to interventions

## How Justice Is Violated
- Disregarding fair allocation principles for limited resources
- Providing preferential treatment based on non-medical factors (wealth, status, connections)
- Allowing discrimination to influence clinical decisions
- Creating unsustainable precedents that disadvantage future patients
- Ignoring societal duties (public health, safety) without justification

## Assessing Justice in Clinical Cases

### 1. Resource Scarcity and Allocation
- **Resource Constraint:** Does the intervention require limited resources (staff time, equipment, medications, beds)?
- **Opportunity Cost:** What other patients or uses are displaced by this allocation?
- **Clinical Priority:** Does this patient's clinical need justify resource use compared to others?
- **Marginal Benefit:** Is the benefit proportionate to resource consumption (e.g., "daily MRIs for stable patient" vs. "emergency MRI for acute stroke")?

### 2. Fairness and Precedent
- **Equal Treatment:** Would similarly situated patients receive this same intervention?
- **VIP Treatment:** Is the patient requesting exceptions to standard policies based on status rather than clinical need?
- **Precedent Impact:** Does providing this treatment create unsustainable expectations or precedent for the healthcare system?
- **Policy Consistency:** Does the decision align with established allocation criteria and institutional policies?

### 3. Individual vs. Collective Duties
- **Public Health Risk:** Does the patient's treatment (or non-treatment) create risks for the general public?
  - *Examples:* Antibiotic resistance, contagion, disease surveillance
- **Third-Party Harm:** Does respecting patient autonomy create specific, identifiable risks to others?
  - *Specific threat:* "Patient credibly threatens violence against named individual"
  - *General concern:* "Patient might be dangerous"
- **Duty to Warn:** Does physician's societal duty override patient confidentiality or preference in this case?

### 4. Discrimination and Bias
- **Protected Characteristics:** Is there evidence that race, ethnicity, language, insurance status, or socioeconomic factors influence the decision?
- **Implicit Bias:** Are there subtle indicators of bias (assumptions about adherence, "difficult patient" labels, lower pain treatment)?
- **Structural Barriers:** Does the decision perpetuate or mitigate existing healthcare disparities?

### 5. Competing Justice Frameworks
- **Need-Based:** Is allocation based on clinical urgency and severity?
- **Benefit-Based:** Is allocation based on likelihood and magnitude of benefit?
- **Equality-Based:** Is allocation based on equal access regardless of outcome probability?
- **Merit-Based:** Are non-clinical factors (e.g., transplant adherence history) appropriately considered?
