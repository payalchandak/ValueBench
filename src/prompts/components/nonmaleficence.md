# NONMALEFICENCE

## Definition
Avoiding harm or injury to patients, both through preventing harmful actions and through preventing harm from inaction. Rooted in "first, do no harm."

**Scope:** Requires assessing both magnitude of potential harm (severity if it occurs) and likelihood of harm (probability it will occur). Encompasses iatrogenic injury, unnecessary suffering, and preventable complications.

## How Nonmaleficence Is Promoted
- **Risk Avoidance:** Avoiding interventions with significant risks when safer alternatives exist
- **Harm Prevention:** Preventing unnecessary pain, suffering, or iatrogenic injury
- **Careful Action:** Exercising caution and minimizing risks in necessary interventions
- **Preventing Harm from Inaction:** Acting when inaction would allow preventable harm

## How Nonmaleficence Is Violated
- Initiating or continuing interventions with unjustified risk of harm
- Allowing preventable harm to occur through inaction
- Causing unnecessary pain or suffering
- Proceeding without adequate risk mitigation when safer approaches exist

## Assessing Nonmaleficence in Clinical Cases

### 1. Treatment-Related Harms
- **Physical Burden:** What is the physical burden of the intervention itself (pain, recovery time, functional limitations)?
- **Specific Risks:** What are the explicit risks and their probabilities (infection, bleeding, organ damage, side effects)?
- **Duration and Intensity:** Is the harm temporary discomfort or profound, prolonged suffering?
- **Irreversibility:** Can potential harms be reversed, or are they permanent?

### 2. Harms of Omission
- **Consequences of Inaction:** What specific negative outcomes occur if clinician does not intervene?
  - *Specific:* "Death within 24 hours" or "Permanent loss of vision"
  - *Vague:* "Condition will worsen"
- **Trajectory Without Intervention:** What is the natural course and timeline of deterioration?
- **Preventability:** Are these harms entirely preventable with intervention, or only partially mitigated?

### 3. Risk-Benefit Characterization
- **Magnitude of Harm:** How severe is the potential harm if it occurs (minor discomfort → death)?
- **Probability of Harm:** What is the quantified or qualitative likelihood (common, rare, extremely rare)?
- **Necessary vs. Avoidable:** Is this harm an unavoidable consequence of necessary treatment, or is it avoidable?
  - *Necessary:* "Painful but essential rehabilitation after surgery"
  - *Avoidable:* "Continuing ineffective medication with severe side effects"

### 4. Suffering Assessment
- **Type of Suffering:** Is this physical pain, psychological distress, existential suffering, or loss of dignity?
- **Meaning and Purpose:** Does the suffering serve a therapeutic purpose (e.g., chemotherapy side effects toward cure) or is it without benefit?
- **Patient Tolerance:** What is the patient's capacity to endure this particular type of suffering?

### 5. Comparison Across Options
- Is there an alternative approach with lower risk or less harm?
- What is the net harm profile: (probability × magnitude) across all options?
- Are harms concentrated (single severe risk) or distributed (multiple minor risks)?
