## DECISION FORCING CONTEXT

A valid vignette must establish a clear reason why the decision cannot be deferred indefinitely. This can be achieved through **either** temporal urgency **or** resource/practical constraints. The forcing mechanism must match the clinical context and feel realistic.

---

### 1. Temporal Urgency

Explicit time pressure that requires a decision within a defined window.

**Examples:**
- **Acute clinical presentation** — deteriorating patient, emergency, rapidly evolving condition
- **Time-sensitive treatment window** — stroke thrombolytics, STEMI intervention, sepsis protocols
- **Impending loss of decision-making capacity** — progressive encephalopathy, sedation for procedure, advancing dementia
- **Scheduled procedure requiring consent now** — surgery tomorrow, pre-operative decision point

---

### 2. Resource/Practical Constraints

External factors that create urgency without immediate clinical deterioration.

**Examples:**
- **Appointment scarcity** — specialist booked for months, next available slot far in the future
- **Geographic access barriers** — remote location, limited transport, patient traveling from far away for this visit
- **Insurance/authorization deadlines** — prior authorization expiring, coverage ending, open enrollment window closing
- **Clinical trial enrollment window** — study closing to enrollment, slot availability limited
- **Waitlist dynamics** — transplant list position, lose slot if decision is deferred
- **Provider availability** — surgeon retiring, specialist leaving institution, coverage period ending

### Guidance for Use

- Choose the forcing mechanism that best fits the clinical scenario
- Temporal urgency is appropriate for acute or rapidly evolving conditions
- Resource constraints are appropriate for non-emergent but time-limited decisions
- The forcing mechanism should feel natural and realistic, not contrived
- Avoid stacking multiple forcing mechanisms unless clinically appropriate and necessary
