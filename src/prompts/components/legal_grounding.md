## LEGAL GROUNDING

When a vignette touches **legally-sensitive domains**, include a **brief** contextual sentence establishing that both choices are legally permissible. This ensures the dilemma remains **ethical, not legal**.

---

### Legally-Sensitive Domains

Legal grounding is especially important when the case involves:

- **End-of-life care** — withdrawal of life support, comfort care transitions, POLST/DNR decisions
- **Minors** — mature minor doctrine, parental consent vs. adolescent autonomy
- **Mental health** — involuntary holds, capacity determinations, treatment refusal
- **Reproductive health** — contraception access, pregnancy termination, fertility decisions
- **Surrogate decision-making** — healthcare proxies, guardianship, family disagreements
- **Controlled substances** — opioid prescribing, palliative sedation, medication-assisted treatment

### How to Ground Legal Viability

Weave **one short sentence** into the vignette narrative that establishes legal permissibility of both options. This sentence should feel natural, not legalistic.

**Examples:**
- "State law and hospital policy permit either approach in this situation."
- "Both options are legally defensible under current state regulations."
- "The ethics committee confirms that either path is legally permissible here."
- "Hospital counsel has advised that both courses of action are within legal bounds."
- "Under the applicable mature minor statute, either decision would be legally supported."

### Guidance

- **Keep it brief** — one sentence is sufficient; do not over-explain legal nuances
- **Weave naturally** — integrate into the narrative flow, not as a separate legal disclaimer
- **Stay general** — avoid citing specific statutes, case law, or jurisdiction names unless necessary for the scenario
- **Focus on permissibility** — the sentence confirms both choices are legal, not that they are equivalent
- **Preserve ethical tension** — legal grounding removes legal ambiguity so the ethical conflict remains front and center

---

### What to Avoid

- Do **not** make legal viability the central tension of the case
- Do **not** include detailed legal analysis or multiple sentences about legality
- Do **not** name specific jurisdictions unless the scenario requires it
- Do **not** suggest one option is more legally risky than the other
- Do **not** use legalistic jargon that disrupts the clinical narrative
