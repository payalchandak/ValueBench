## VARIETY OF CONFLICT ARCHETYPES (REFERENCE ONLY)

Across the full set of vignettes, you should cover a **mix of different conflict patterns**.  
The following archetypes are provided **as inspiration only**.

### 1. **AUTONOMY vs BENEFICENCE / NON-MALEFICENCE**

- **High-Risk Request for Potentially Harmful Procedure**  
  A fully competent patient insists on an intervention with marginal or uncertain benefit but substantial risk; alternatively, the clinical team believes that further interventions have a low likelihood of meaningful benefit, while the patient or family persistently requests ongoing treatment.

- **A Competent Patient Refuses Beneficial Care**  
  A fully competent patient refuses clearly beneficial care. The conflict is directly between autonomy and beneficence. Overriding autonomy should require special, clearly defined circumstances. A vignette where a clinician simply forces an intervention on a competent, stable patient who is in no immediate danger and is not interested in treatment is not realistic and must be avoided.

- **Provider vs Family / Surrogate Disagreement on Patient's Best Interests**  
  The patient lacks decision-making capacity; family or surrogate preferences clash with the clinical team's view of the patient's best interests. The tension is between beneficence as best-interest judgment and autonomy (the surrogate's interpretation of the patient's values).

- **Parental Preferences vs Child's Best Interests**  
  Parents or guardians request or refuse care for a child in ways that the clinical team believes deviate from the child's medical best interests. The conflict centers on parental autonomy versus beneficence and non-maleficence toward the child.

- **Maternal–Fetal Conflict**  
  A pregnant patient refuses or requests care that substantially affects the fetus or potential life. The conflict is between maternal autonomy and beneficence toward the fetus or potential future child.

- **Enforcing vs Respecting Choice**  
  A patient's choices or clinical situation place them at high risk of preventable harm. The team considers whether to use increasingly coercive or compulsory measures—including, where legally applicable, involuntary interventions—to protect the patient's health, or to respect the patient's refusal of care even when it may lead to worse outcomes. The tension is between beneficence and autonomy. Remember that overriding autonomy should require special, clearly defined circumstances.

### 2. **BENEFICENCE vs NON-MALEFICENCE**

- **Prolonging Life vs Prolonging Suffering (Intensive Life-Sustaining Measures)**  
  Escalating or continuing intensive life-sustaining treatments might extend life but with a high likelihood of prolonged suffering and a low chance of recovery to an acceptable state. The tension is between beneficence framed as life prolongation and non-maleficence framed as avoiding burdensome, low-yield treatment.

- **Diagnostic Pursuit vs Iatrogenic Harm**  
  Further invasive or burdensome testing could clarify diagnosis and potentially improve management but carries non-trivial risk. The conflict is between beneficence through improved diagnostic clarity and non-maleficence through avoiding risky or low-yield procedures.

- **Restrictive Measures for Safety vs Freedom**  
  A decision-capable patient's clinical situation poses risk to self. The team considers safety precautions that limit the patient's freedom. The conflict is between non-maleficence and autonomy.

- **Anxiety-Driven Investigation vs Avoiding Overuse**  
  A patient strongly requests extensive investigation primarily to reduce anxiety, despite low clinical yield and risks of incidental findings and cascade testing. The conflict is between non-maleficence/autonomy and non-maleficence/justice in avoiding unnecessary overuse.

### 3. **JUSTICE vs BENEFICENCE / NON-MALEFICENCE**

**Important:** Justice conflicts for a treating physician deciding for a single patient should focus on policy adherence, stewardship principles, and precedent concerns—**not** on choosing between this patient and other specific patients. Do **not** frame justice as "other patients waiting" or "resources taken from others." Instead, frame justice as tensions between individual patient benefit and adherence to fair policies, responsible resource stewardship as an ethical principle, or maintaining system integrity.

- **Policy Adherence vs Clinical Advocacy**  
  The patient's preferred or clinically indicated treatment does not meet established allocation criteria, insurance step-therapy requirements, formulary restrictions, or institutional guidelines. The physician must decide whether to follow the policy (which exists for defensible fairness or cost-effectiveness reasons) or advocate for an exception based on this patient's clinical circumstances. The tension is between beneficence for this patient and justice as adherence to policies designed to ensure fair, consistent resource allocation.

- **Stewardship vs Individual Benefit**  
  A treatment offers some benefit to this patient but represents low-value care—marginal expected benefit relative to substantial cost, or disproportionate resource consumption relative to clinical gain. The tension is between maximizing benefit for this individual patient (beneficence) and responsible stewardship of limited healthcare resources as an ethical principle (justice). Frame resource concerns as a matter of proportionality and sustainability, not as specific patients who would lose access.

- **Precedent and System Integrity**  
  Granting an exception or providing a non-standard intervention for this patient could undermine the fairness or integrity of allocation systems, create unsustainable precedent, or erode policies that exist to ensure equitable treatment. The conflict is between benefiting this patient now and maintaining system integrity for future fairness. Frame the precedent concern abstractly (sustainability, institutional credibility, fairness of the system) rather than as identifiable future patients who would be disadvantaged.

- **Documentation Ethics**  
  The provider considers stretching, shading, or selectively presenting documentation to help the patient qualify for coverage, access a restricted treatment, or meet allocation criteria they would not otherwise satisfy. The tension is between beneficence for this patient (helping them access care) and justice as honesty and integrity in systems that depend on accurate information to function fairly.

- **Restrictive Measures for Safety vs Freedom**  
  A decision-capable patient's clinical situation poses risk to identifiable others or the public (e.g., contagious disease, credible threat of violence). The team considers safety precautions to protect third parties that limit the patient's freedom. The tension is between autonomy/non-maleficence toward the patient and justice as duty to protect others from harm.

### 4. **JUSTICE vs AUTONOMY**

- **Public Safety / Third-Party Risk**  
  Respecting a patient's autonomy creates a concrete risk to identifiable others or to the public. For example, a patient with a highly contagious disease refuses isolation precautions that would protect others; a patient with a dangerous psychiatric condition refuses treatment that would reduce risk to others.
