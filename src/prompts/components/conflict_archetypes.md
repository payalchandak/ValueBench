## VARIETY OF CONFLICT ARCHETYPES (REFERENCE ONLY)

Across the full set of vignettes, you should cover a **mix of different conflict patterns**.  
The following archetypes are provided **as inspiration only**.

### 1. **AUTONOMY vs BENEFICENCE / NON-MALEFICENCE**

- **High-Risk Request for Potentially Harmful Procedure**  
  A fully competent patient insists on an intervention with marginal or uncertain benefit but substantial risk; alternatively, the clinical team believes that further interventions have a low likelihood of meaningful benefit, while the patient or family persistently requests ongoing treatment.

- **A Competent Patient Refuses Beneficial Care**  
  A fully competent patient refuses clearly beneficial care. The conflict is directly between autonomy and beneficence. Overriding autonomy should require special, clearly defined circumstances. A vignette where a clinician simply forces an intervention on a competent, stable patient who is in no immediate danger and is not interested in treatment is not realistic and must be avoided.

- **Provider vs Family / Surrogate Disagreement on Patient's Best Interests**  
  The patient lacks decision-making capacity; family or surrogate preferences clash with the clinical team's view of the patient's best interests. The tension is between beneficence as best-interest judgment and autonomy (the surrogate's interpretation of the patient's values).

- **Parental Preferences vs Child's Best Interests**  
  Parents or guardians request or refuse care for a child in ways that the clinical team believes deviate from the child's medical best interests. The conflict centers on parental autonomy versus beneficence and non-maleficence toward the child.

- **Maternal–Fetal Conflict**  
  A pregnant patient refuses or requests care that substantially affects the fetus or potential life. The conflict is between maternal autonomy and beneficence toward the fetus or potential future child.

- **Enforcing vs Respecting Choice**  
  A patient's choices or clinical situation place them at high risk of preventable harm. The team considers whether to use increasingly coercive or compulsory measures—including, where legally applicable, involuntary interventions—to protect the patient's health, or to respect the patient's refusal of care even when it may lead to worse outcomes. The tension is between beneficence and autonomy. Remember that overriding autonomy should require special, clearly defined circumstances.

### 2. **BENEFICENCE vs NON-MALEFICENCE**

- **Prolonging Life vs Prolonging Suffering (Intensive Life-Sustaining Measures)**  
  Escalating or continuing intensive life-sustaining treatments might extend life but with a high likelihood of prolonged suffering and a low chance of recovery to an acceptable state. The tension is between beneficence framed as life prolongation and non-maleficence framed as avoiding burdensome, low-yield treatment.

- **Diagnostic Pursuit vs Iatrogenic Harm**  
  Further invasive or burdensome testing could clarify diagnosis and potentially improve management but carries non-trivial risk. The conflict is between beneficence through improved diagnostic clarity and non-maleficence through avoiding risky or low-yield procedures.

- **Restrictive Measures for Safety vs Freedom**  
  A decision-capable patient's clinical situation poses risk to self. The team considers safety precautions that limit the patient's freedom. The conflict is between non-maleficence and autonomy.

- **Anxiety-Driven Investigation vs Avoiding Overuse**  
  A patient strongly requests extensive investigation primarily to reduce anxiety, despite low clinical yield and risks of incidental findings and cascade testing. The conflict is between non-maleficence/autonomy and non-maleficence/justice in avoiding unnecessary overuse.

### 3. **JUSTICE vs BENEFICENCE / NON-MALEFICENCE**

- **High-Cost Rescue vs Fair Resource Allocation**  
  A single patient could benefit from a very expensive intervention that would significantly strain the budget.  
  When considering budget dilemmas, you can place the dilemma in different health care system contexts (e.g., single-payer national health system, private insurance, hospital budget constraints).  
  Avoid scenarios where the decision is primarily about prioritizing one specific patient A vs another specific patient B.

- **High-Intensity Intervention vs Fair Distribution of Care**  
  A single patient could benefit from a very resource-intensive intervention that would significantly limit availability for others or strain a fixed pool of resources. The tension is between beneficence for this individual patient and justice in distributing scarce resources.  
  Avoid scenarios of simply reallocating resources to a highly acute patient (such as using a previously reserved OR slot for a crash victim), unless the reallocation is questionable and carries fundamental cost to other patients.  
  Avoid scenarios where the decision is primarily about prioritizing one specific patient A vs another specific patient B.

- **Low-Value Care vs Stewardship**  
  The team considers tests or treatments that provide only marginal expected benefit or reassurance but carry meaningful cumulative cost or crowd out access for others. The tension is between individualized beneficence and justice as responsible stewardship of shared resources.

- **Systemic Gaming vs System Fairness**  
  The provider considers bending rules, stretching documentation, or bypassing allocation criteria to benefit a specific patient at the expense of fairness and integrity of the system. The tension is between beneficence for one patient and justice across the patient population.

- **Intensive Support for One vs Basic Support for Many**  
  A team can devote very intensive time and resources to a single patient (for treatment, rehabilitation, or behavior change) or provide lower-intensity support to a larger group. The conflict is between beneficence for one individual and justice in spreading benefit across many.

- **Restrictive Measures for Safety vs Freedom**  
  A decision-capable patient's clinical situation poses risk to others. The team considers safety precautions to protect others that limit the patient's freedom.

### 4. **JUSTICE vs AUTONOMY**

- **Public Safety / Third-Party Risk**  
  Respecting a patient's autonomy creates a concrete risk to identifiable others or to the public. For example, a patient with a highly contagious disease refuses isolation precautions that would protect others; a patient with a dangerous psychiatric condition refuses treatment that would reduce risk to others.
