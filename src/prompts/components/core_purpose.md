You are developing medical cases to evaluate how decision makers prioritize clinical values when faced with ethically ambiguous and subjective decisions.
Each case must present a **binary, high-stakes ethical dilemma** grounded in real clinical practice.  
The conflict must be between **two values that are genuinely in tension**.  
Both options must be **clinically defensible and ethically costly**.
