## Autonomy

Autonomy is the capacity of individuals to hold views, make choices, and take actions based on their values and beliefs. The everyday choices of generally competent persons are autonomous. Autonomous action can be understood in terms of normal choosers who act (1) intentionally, (2) with understanding, and (3) without controlling influences that determine their action. 

Intentional actions require plans that correspond to what the person means to do. Actions remain intentional even when outcomes are undesired, motivations are conflicting, or one wishes the action were unnecessary. 

Understanding requires only a substantial degree of comprehension, not complete understanding, since conditions like illness, irrationality, immaturity, or communication deficiencies can limit understanding, and requiring perfect understanding would be impractical for real-world decision-making. 

Finally, autonomous choice requires freedom from influences that limit voluntariness, whether external (such as coercion and manipulation by others) or internal (such as mental illness).

Respect for autonomy involves respectful action, not merely a respectful attitude. However, obligations to respect autonomy do not extend to persons who cannot act autonomously because, for instance, they are immature, incapacitated, ignorant, coerced, or exploited.

## Nonmaleficence 

The  principle  of nonmaleficence  obligates  us  to  abstain  from  causing  harm  to  others.

Nonmaleficence is not the following:  One  ought  to  prevent  evil  or  harm.  3.  One  ought  to  remove  evil  or  harm.  4.  One  ought  to  do or  promote  good

Each  of the  three  principles  of beneficence  requires  taking  action  by help-  ing—preventing  harm,  removing  harm,  and  promoting  good—whereas  nonma-  leficence  requires  only  intentional  avoidance  of actions  that  cause  harm.

A harm  is a  thwarting,  defeating,  or  setting  back  of some  party’s  interests,  but  a  harmful  action  is not  always  a  wrong  or  unjustified.  Harmful  actions  that  involve  justifiable  setbacks  to anoth-  er’s  interests  are  not  wrong—for  example,  justified  amputation  of a  patient’s  leg,

Some  definitions  of harm  are  so  broad  that  they  include  setbacks  to  inter- 
ests  in reputation,  property,  privacy,  and  liberty  or,  in  some  writings,  discom- 
fort,  humiliation,  offense,  and  annoyance.  Such  broad  conceptions  can  still 
154  PRINCIPLES  OF  BIOMEDICAL  ETHICS  distinguish  trivial  harms  from  serious  harms  by the  magnitude  of the  interests  affected.  Other  accounts  with  a  narrower  focus  view  harms  exclusively  as  setbacks  to  physical  and  psychological  interests,  such  as  those  in  health  and  survival.
We  concentrate  on  physical  harms,  especially  pain,  disability,  suffering,  and  death,  while  still  affirming  the importance  of mental  harms  and other  setbacks  to inter-  ests.

Negligence  is the absence  of due care.  In the professions  negligence  involves  a departure  from  the professional  standards  that  determine  due care  in given  cir-  cumstances.  The  term  negligence  covers  two  types  of situations:  (1) intention-  ally imposing  unreasonable  risks  of harm  (advertent  negligence  or recklessness)  and  (2) unintentionally  but  carelessly  imposing  risks  of harm  (inadvertent  neg-  ligence).

## Beneficence 

Positive  beneficence  requires  agents  to provide  benefits  to others.  Utility requires that agents balance  benefits,  risks,  and costs  to produce the  best  overall  results.

Nonetheless,  the  principle  of positive  beneficence  supports  an  array  of prima  facie  rules  of obli-  gation,  including  the  following: 
1.  Protect  and  defend  the  rights  of others. 
.  Prevent  harm  from  occurring  to others. 
.  Remove  conditions  that  will  cause  harm  to  others. 
.  Help  persons  with  disabilities. 
.  Rescue  persons  in danger.

Rules  of beneficence  differ  in  several  ways  from  those  of nonmaleficence.  In  the  previous  chapter  we  argued  that  rules  of nonmaleficence  (1)  are  negative  prohibitions  of action,  (2) must  be  followed  impartially,  and  (3) provide  moral  reasons  for legal  prohibitions  of certain  forms  of conduct.  By contrast,  rules  of  beneficence  (1) present  positive  requirements  of action,  (2) need  not  always  be  followed  impartially,  and  (3) generally  do not  provide  reasons  for  legal  punish-  ment  when  agents  fail  to  abide  by them.

## Justice

material  principle  of dis-  tributive  justice: 
1.  To  each  person  according  to  rules  and  actions  that  maximize  social  utility 
2.  To  each  person  a  maximum  of liberty  and  property  resulting  from  the  exercise  of liberty  rights  and  participation  in fair  free-market  exchanges  3.  To  each  person  according  to  principles  of fair  distribution  derived  from  conceptions  of the  good  developed  in moral  communities 
4.  To each  person  an  equal  measure  of liberty and  equal  access  to the goods  in life  that  every  rational  person  values 
5.  To each  person  the means  necessary  for the exercise  of capabilities essen-  tial  for a flourishing  life 
6.  To  each  person  the  means  necessary  for  the  realization  of core  dimen-  sions  of well-being.
