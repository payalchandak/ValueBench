## MANDATORY INTERNAL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing a vignette, internally verify:

- Is the dilemma ethical rather than clinical or technical?
- Is the moral cost on **both sides** meaningful?
- Would reasonable clinicians disagree in good faith?
- Are both options clinically plausible and ethically defensible?
- Is the value conflict unmistakable?
- Does the case involve **at least two values** in genuine conflict, where each value has opposing tags (if Choice 1 promotes it, Choice 2 violates it)?
- Does the case avoid the pattern of one choice promoting multiple values while the other violates all of them?
- Is the vignette ≤100 words and neutrally written?
- Is it distinct from prior accepted vignettes?

If **any** answer is "no," regenerate.
