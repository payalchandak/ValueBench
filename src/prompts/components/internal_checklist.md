## MANDATORY INTERNAL CHECKLIST

Before finalizing a vignette, internally verify:

- Is the dilemma ethical rather than clinical or technical?
- Is the moral cost on **both sides** meaningful?
- Would reasonable clinicians disagree in good faith?
- Are both options clinically plausible and ethically defensible?
- Is the value conflict unmistakable?
- Does the case engage **at least two values** (non-neutral on at least 2 values)?
- For each individual value, is the pattern valid? (No promotes+promotes or violates+violates on the same value)
- Is there cross-value opposition? (Different values promoted, different values violated, or same-value opposition)
- Does the case avoid pure-upside vs pure-downside patterns? (One choice all good, other all bad = obvious answer)
- If one choice has only downsides (no promotions), does the other also lack pure upside?
- Does the vignette and choices meet the writing style requirements?
- Is it distinct from prior accepted vignettes?

If **any** answer is "no," regenerate.
