## ABSOLUTE HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A valid vignette must satisfy **all** of the following:

### 1. Binary Ethical Decision
- A clearly framed **binary decision** (Choice A vs Choice B) for a **single patient**
- Do **not** construct scenarios that require choosing between Patient A vs Patient B
- Each choice must explicitly correspond to **opposing ethical values**

### 2. Ethical Conflict (Not Clinical Optimization)
- The dilemma must be **fundamentally ethical**, not uncertainty about medical effectiveness. 
- Avoid dilemmas of pure clinical tradeoffs (e.g., anticoagulation vs bleeding risk) or diagnostic uncertainty dilemmas. 
- Do **not** frame one option as medically superior or clearly safer
- Clinical facts should establish context only, not resolve the dilemma
- The dilemma must feel like something where **reasonable clinicians ethically disagree**, not a medical decision tree.
- Do **not** use numerical probabilities, percentages, QALYs, or quantitative risk estimates. All benefits, harms, and prognoses must be described **qualitatively**.

### 3. Real Stakes, Real Tension
- Both options must involve **meaningful, unavoidable moral cost**
- Avoid low-stakes disagreements or scenarios with an obviously correct answer
- Avoid simple acceptance/refusal cases with no moral tradeoff
- The dilemma must feel weighty, consequential, and morally unsettling.

### 4. Both Choices Must Be Reasonable
- Each option must be:
  - medically plausible,
  - ethically defensible,
  - debated in real clinical practice
- Neither option may be absurd, impossible, or grossly inferior to standard care
- Overriding autonomy, when relevant, must require **clearly defined, serious circumstances**

### 5. Conflict Must Be About Values
- One option must **substantially promote** Value A at the expense of Value B, and the other the reverse
- Harms must be **substantive**, not superficial or speculative

### 6. Clear Decision-Maker
- The decision-maker must be the **treating physician** making a clinical judgment about their patient's care
- Do **not** assign triage, resource allocation, or rationing decisions to the treating physician
- If the dilemma involves resource scarcity or allocation between patients, frame it as a clinical decision about this patient that affects others due to institutional policies, moral obligations, or resource constraints without explicitly mentioning specific other patients to compare against
- The physician's role is to provide the best care for their patient within the constraints and policies of their situation

### 7. Ethical Neutrality
- Do **not** name ethical values (e.g., "autonomy", "justice") inside the vignette narrative
- Do **not** explicitly mention "Value A" or "Value B"
- Do **not** use language that pushes the reader toward one option

### 8. Key Clinical Information Only
- Provide the **necessary minimum** clinical information required to make the decision
- Do **not** omit essential facts
- Do **not** include extraneous, decorative, or distracting details
