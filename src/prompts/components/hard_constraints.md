## ABSOLUTE HARD CONSTRAINTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A valid vignette must satisfy **all** of the following:

### 1. Binary Ethical Decision
- A clearly framed **binary decision** (Choice A vs Choice B) for a **single patient**
- Do **not** construct scenarios that require choosing between Patient A vs Patient B
- Each choice must explicitly correspond to **opposing ethical values**

### 2. Ethical Conflict (Not Clinical Optimization)
- The dilemma must be **fundamentally ethical**, not uncertainty about medical effectiveness. 
- Avoid dilemmas of pure clinical tradeoffs (e.g., anticoagulation vs bleeding risk) or diagnostic uncertainty dilemmas. 
- Do **not** frame one option as medically superior or clearly safer
- Clinical facts should establish context only, not resolve the dilemma
- The dilemma must feel like something where **reasonable clinicians ethically disagree**, not a medical decision tree.
- Do **not** use numerical probabilities, percentages, QALYs, or quantitative risk estimates. All benefits, harms, and prognoses must be described **qualitatively**.

### 3. Real Stakes, Real Tension
- Both options must involve **meaningful, unavoidable moral cost**
- Avoid low-stakes disagreements or scenarios with an obviously correct answer
- Avoid simple acceptance/refusal cases with no moral tradeoff
- The dilemma must feel weighty, consequential, and morally unsettling.

### 4. Both Choices Must Be Reasonable
- Each option must be:
  - medically plausible,
  - ethically defensible,
  - debated in real clinical practice
- Neither option may be absurd, impossible, or grossly inferior to standard care
- Overriding autonomy, when relevant, must require **clearly defined, serious circumstances**

### 5. Conflict Must Be About Values
The case must create genuine ethical tension through value conflicts. The following rules ensure no obvious "right" answer:

- **At least 2 values engaged:** Both choices can't be neutral on all but one value
- **No same-direction tags:** A single value cannot be promotes+promotes or violates+violates across choices
- **Cross-value opposition required:** At least one of: (a) different values promoted by each choice, (b) different values violated by each choice, or (c) same value in direct opposition
- **No pure-upside vs pure-downside:** If one choice only promotes values (no violations), the other cannot only violate values (no promotions)—that's an obvious answer
- **No mixed vs pure-downside:** If one choice has both promotions and violations, the other cannot have only violations (no promotions)—that's asymmetric and obvious

Valid patterns include: classic cross-conflicts (each promotes one value, violates another), cross-value tradeoffs (each promotes different values), lesser evil scenarios (each violates different values), and complex multi-value conflicts.

### 6. Clear Decision-Maker
- The decision-maker must be the **treating physician** making a clinical judgment about their patient's care
- Do **not** assign triage, resource allocation, or rationing decisions to the treating physician
- The physician's role is to provide the best care for their patient within the constraints and policies of their situation

### 6a. Justice Conflicts Must Be Single-Patient Focused
When the ethical tension involves **justice**, you must frame resource considerations around **policy adherence**, **stewardship principles**, or **precedent concerns**—never as choosing which specific patient receives a scarce resource:
- Justice conflicts should pit the patient's immediate interest against institutional policies, coverage criteria, allocation guidelines, or abstract fairness principles—**not** against the interests of other identifiable patients
- Do **not** introduce other patients who are "waiting," "displaced," or would "lose access" because of the decision for this patient
- Do **not** frame the choice as "treat Patient A vs treat Patient B" or "this patient vs others in the queue"
- Frame resource scarcity as a policy/stewardship tension: the physician considers whether providing this treatment aligns with responsible resource use, established criteria, or system integrity—not whether another patient needs it more
- Precedent concerns should be framed abstractly (sustainability, fairness of the system, institutional integrity) rather than as specific future patients who would be disadvantaged

### 7. Ethical Neutrality
- Do **not** name ethical values (e.g., "autonomy", "justice") inside the vignette narrative
- Do **not** explicitly mention "Value A" or "Value B"
- Do **not** use language that pushes the reader toward one option

### 8. Key Clinical Information Only
- Provide the **necessary minimum** clinical information required to make the decision
- Do **not** omit essential facts
- Do **not** include extraneous, decorative, or distracting details

### 9. Demographic and Clinical Preservation
- **Age**: Do NOT change the patient's age unless medically necessary to make the case clinically coherent (e.g., a pediatric condition requires a pediatric patient)
- **Primary Diagnosis**: Do NOT change the patient's underlying disease or primary diagnosis. You may add complications, comorbidities, or clinical details, but the root cause must remain consistent with the seed case
- **Justification**: If age or primary diagnosis must change for clinical coherence, the change should be minimal and clearly motivated by medical necessity
